You're back live.
You're back live.
Hi.
Let me get the uh the chat set up here
and I'll talk about what we're going to
and I'll talk about what we're going to
do today.
One second.
One second.
This is going to be um
a heck of a work day.
So, we're basically going to try to get
So, we're basically going to try to get
everything done for release
everything done for release
except pressing the launch button.
except pressing the launch button.
Pretty much that.
So, what do we have to do to get there?
So, what do we have to do to get there?
Well, unfortunately, uh the jobs that we
Well, unfortunately, uh the jobs that we
had last night died because power
had last night died because power
outage, which is always fun. Uh we did
outage, which is always fun. Uh we did
get some data though before they died.
get some data though before they died.
In particular, the latest stuff on
In particular, the latest stuff on
neural MMO looks very, very good.
all these different sweeps that I did.
all these different sweeps that I did.
And uh this one on Neural MMO.
Now, you never really want to bet too
Now, you never really want to bet too
much on these upticks at the end because
much on these upticks at the end because
um
um
there's like sampling bias. But if we
there's like sampling bias. But if we
even if we look sort of here at this
even if we look sort of here at this
sort of portion of the curve, I think
sort of portion of the curve, I think
it's very likely we get something above
it's very likely we get something above
seven in a reasonable amount of time.
seven in a reasonable amount of time.
And uh I don't know, we might end up
And uh I don't know, we might end up
actually seeing something way way better
actually seeing something way way better
if we run this for even longer. So I've
if we run this for even longer. So I've
started up this new one here. It's tiny.
started up this new one here. It's tiny.
Also a fair bit of variance from run to
Also a fair bit of variance from run to
run. So it's always not like it's not
run. So it's always not like it's not
always super easy to say. This is
always super easy to say. This is
literally the same run that I've started
literally the same run that I've started
and just it's bought on a little
and just it's bought on a little
quicker. Um but regardless, we'll see
quicker. Um but regardless, we'll see
what this does. There's also I've seen
what this does. There's also I've seen
some instability where some of these
some instability where some of these
runs uh kind of crash after a bit. So
runs uh kind of crash after a bit. So
like the reward crashes, but we'll see.
like the reward crashes, but we'll see.
You know, we'll monitor this throughout
You know, we'll monitor this throughout
the day and we'll hope that the uh there
the day and we'll hope that the uh there
are no more power interruptions.
are no more power interruptions.
I can guarantee there will be no more
I can guarantee there will be no more
power interruptions
power interruptions
in a few days because uh we're going to
in a few days because uh we're going to
have the UPS installed. It's a backup
have the UPS installed. It's a backup
generator. It's just that right now it
generator. It's just that right now it
doesn't switch over fast enough. So
doesn't switch over fast enough. So
that'll all be taken care of. Cool. Um,
let's actually just get the master list
let's actually just get the master list
real quick of like
real quick of like
things we need to do. Finally launch
things we need to do. Finally launch
this. Done with this launch. Way way way
this. Done with this launch. Way way way
too long. Want to move on and work on
too long. Want to move on and work on
other things around RL with Puffer.
don't have a todo in here anyways.
So
baselines
baselines
for all environments
for all environments
run
run
port all baselines
port all baselines
to website.
Um I am fine here.
Help.
I am fine here. Uh either
I am fine here. Uh either
downscale
downscale
or simplify annoying
or simplify annoying
policies
cuz I don't want to spend all day just
cuz I don't want to spend all day just
writing C networks.
Square
Square
available.
I think the other main things we got to
I think the other main things we got to
double check. Whoops.
Double check examples
maybe around some of
maybe around some of
SPI
checks.
The new M's don't have articles,
The new M's don't have articles,
individual articles yet, but that will
individual articles yet, but that will
be resolved.
Other things I promised for release.
Other things I promised for release.
I mean, there's always going to be like
I mean, there's always going to be like
testing
pie
pie
going to be a pain.
Is there anything else?
Obviously
testing package install.
More than anything else, I just want
More than anything else, I just want
this to not be broken on release, right?
this to not be broken on release, right?
I don't want to not have a whole bunch
I don't want to not have a whole bunch
of support issues where we have like
of support issues where we have like
basic installation stuff or whatever.
I think that's kind of it.
I think that's kind of it.
What's going on with this thing? Oh,
What's going on with this thing? Oh,
okay.
okay.
Cool. Yeah, that does then. Um, that
Cool. Yeah, that does then. Um, that
already 1.5 bill. Yeah, that's crazy.
already 1.5 bill. Yeah, that's crazy.
Literally, while I've been talking, I
Literally, while I've been talking, I
launched this right before I started
launched this right before I started
stream. This is already done. 1.5
stream. This is already done. 1.5
billion steps in neural MMO. For
billion steps in neural MMO. For
context, that's uh about 30 years worth
context, that's uh about 30 years worth
of games.
Billion seconds is 30 some odd years.
Billion seconds is 30 some odd years.
And uh the game rate is one step per 0.6
And uh the game rate is one step per 0.6
seconds.
I'm pretty sure I've already done this
I'm pretty sure I've already done this
for pong and breakout as well.
for pong and breakout as well.
We'll do this
We'll do this
here.
Excuse
me.
These are our new docs.
Discord banner breaking is very silly.
We have I believe this is yet new pong.
out.
There is frame skip here, but we're
There is frame skip here, but we're
smoothing frames.
I believe we did the new enduro policy
I believe we did the new enduro policy
as well.
That was me playing.
I don't know what we do about snake.
So, we can get I'm sure we can get
So, we can get I'm sure we can get
reasonable policies for most of these
reasonable policies for most of these
things.
Why don't we just try real quick?
Oops.
Yeah. So this is the non-recurrent
You can just immediately see the
You can just immediately see the
difference, right?
difference, right?
with the recurrent policy. Hey.
Well, hang on. It's
Well, hang on. It's
there is a one hot requirement, right?
Try this.
not be multiplied.
Ah.
I will be right back.
So that runs cool. I'll be right back.
Oh, that's funny.
Oh, that's funny.
You don't need coms.
You don't need coms.
Isn't that funny?
Look at that.
Look at that.
You need you need the one hot encoder,
You need you need the one hot encoder,
but you actually don't need coms.
It's like barely makes a difference.
That's so funny.
3 million steps a second. 3.5. That's
3 million steps a second. 3.5. That's
lovely.
It does have like a decent chunk more
It does have like a decent chunk more
params, but like do we care? Faster.
I think what we're going to do,
I think what we're going to do,
let's do a Billy.
Yes, rewards are automatically being
Yes, rewards are automatically being
clipped to negative one to one in the uh
clipped to negative one to one in the uh
Puffarel file. And the reason for that,
Puffarel file. And the reason for that,
we did that after we spent forever
we did that after we spent forever
trying to figure out why breakout
trying to figure out why breakout
wouldn't work. And it ended up being a
wouldn't work. And it ended up being a
wrapper difference. And I decided screw
wrapper difference. And I decided screw
it. we're going to clip all the rewards
it. we're going to clip all the rewards
and then you can tune around it. Um, and
and then you can tune around it. Um, and
if your env has bigger reward
if your env has bigger reward
magnitudes, you should probably fix
magnitudes, you should probably fix
that.
that.
So, what I would suggest instead is you
So, what I would suggest instead is you
change the reward magnitudes of the
change the reward magnitudes of the
other ones to probably be smaller. You
other ones to probably be smaller. You
are going to have to tune because like
are going to have to tune because like
the defaults, the defaults kind of
the defaults, the defaults kind of
assume that you're roughly in the oneish
assume that you're roughly in the oneish
reward range. Like I tend to use things
reward range. Like I tend to use things
between maybe 0.1 at the very lowest and
between maybe 0.1 at the very lowest and
uh one at the highest or negative one to
uh one at the highest or negative one to
one but like 0.1 is the smallest uh
one but like 0.1 is the smallest uh
distinguisher from zero.
distinguisher from zero.
Also yo Spencer it turns out you don't
Also yo Spencer it turns out you don't
need coms for snake you just need the uh
need coms for snake you just need the uh
the one hot encoder.
the one hot encoder.
So I think we actually are going to be
So I think we actually are going to be
able to make a lot of the network
able to make a lot of the network
architectures way faster if we do this.
architectures way faster if we do this.
Um, hell, I might Yeah, I have all sorts
Um, hell, I might Yeah, I have all sorts
of things I can do with this now. It's
of things I can do with this now. It's
kind of funny.
It turns out you don't need coms when
It turns out you don't need coms when
you have this much data.
Yeah. So, it's you do need the uh you
Yeah. So, it's you do need the uh you
need the one hot encoding.
need the one hot encoding.
And actually, I'm going to do this for
And actually, I'm going to do this for
our default nets for now. Even though I
our default nets for now. Even though I
the com is like technically kind of
the com is like technically kind of
smarter. Uh the reason I'm going to do
smarter. Uh the reason I'm going to do
this for default nets is that they run
this for default nets is that they run
faster. So, I can actually run these on
faster. So, I can actually run these on
the web way easier
global. Well, it's not necessarily that
global. Well, it's not necessarily that
coms are bad. It's just um
coms are bad. It's just um
at least the way we have them now,
at least the way we have them now,
they're kind of slow, you know?
they're kind of slow, you know?
Like coms are not a bad building block
Like coms are not a bad building block
for what like we we should probably do
for what like we we should probably do
like some perf engineering at some
like some perf engineering at some
point. I don't know. There's so many
point. I don't know. There's so many
things I can potentially work on with
things I can potentially work on with
this stuff.
this stuff.
We need to like just knock down uh a
We need to like just knock down uh a
couple contracts or whatever so we can
couple contracts or whatever so we can
get back to like really hammering the
get back to like really hammering the
fundamentals.
Uh, today will be a long is going to be
Uh, today will be a long is going to be
like long work day for me and I'm going
like long work day for me and I'm going
to attempt to get basically everything
to attempt to get basically everything
all the remaining crap done for release.
all the remaining crap done for release.
So, we're basically ready to just do it.
So, we're basically ready to just do it.
whether I actually launch tomorrow or
whether I actually launch tomorrow or
whether we decide that we uh want to get
whether we decide that we uh want to get
like a trailer cut together or stuff.
like a trailer cut together or stuff.
We'll see about that. But yeah.
No, it's from I see I've seen people do
No, it's from I see I've seen people do
this. Actually, I have a client that's
this. Actually, I have a client that's
done this. Um people will put like point
done this. Um people will put like point
like negative.
like negative.
Z5 or like 0001
Z5 or like 0001
and like they'll wonder why the thing
and like they'll wonder why the thing
isn't getting picked up. Like that's
isn't getting picked up. Like that's
basically going to get ignored unless
basically going to get ignored unless
you have unless you have some other
you have unless you have some other
hyperparameter that's effectively
hyperparameter that's effectively
scaling that thing up massively. Like
scaling that thing up massively. Like
that ain't gonna do anything.
There's no actual clipping happening
There's no actual clipping happening
like that's going to one or anything.
like that's going to one or anything.
It's just negative one to one as the
It's just negative one to one as the
only clip.
only clip.
That helps.
Let me actually DM uh
the following content is provided. Oh
the following content is provided. Oh
yeah, I started doing this uh solid
yeah, I started doing this uh solid
state chemistry stuff just in the
state chemistry stuff just in the
evening or whenever I'm doing things.

I'm just like starting to go through
I'm just like starting to go through
diff different hard science stuff trying

to figure out um just like I don't know
to figure out um just like I don't know
enough to find all our apps. I DM' well.
I don't know why I sent this.
Hello, Landor.
Hello, Landor.
Welcome.

He does cool stuff though. Uh, yeah.
He does cool stuff though. Uh, yeah.
Slander, have you seen Neural MMO 3.0?
Slander, have you seen Neural MMO 3.0?
So, we've got this thing here. This is
So, we've got this thing here. This is
the new version of the environment.
It's big.
It's actually human playable. So, if I
It's actually human playable. So, if I
hit control here, I can like take over
hit control here, I can like take over
and play for this guy. There's armor,
and play for this guy. There's armor,
equipment, weapons, a market, and this
equipment, weapons, a market, and this
actually is like runs a thousand times
actually is like runs a thousand times
faster than my thesis. So, I actually
faster than my thesis. So, I actually
like after my thesis, I went back and I
like after my thesis, I went back and I
did a crazy version of this.
did a crazy version of this.
Um, and we actually have this thing
Um, and we actually have this thing
training for like huge amounts of time
training for like huge amounts of time
now. We have a run going right now on
now. We have a run going right now on
six GPUs. That is I just started this.

This is already 5 billion steps in. I'm
This is already 5 billion steps in. I'm

You're going to see some very cool
You're going to see some very cool
things around this quite soon.
things around this quite soon.
We're also always looking for
We're also always looking for
contributors if you want to get involved
contributors if you want to get involved
in building stuff like this. It is uh
in building stuff like this. It is uh
well, I won't say it's not hard, but
well, I won't say it's not hard, but
I've made it a heck of a lot easier than
I've made it a heck of a lot easier than
it used to be. And uh we actually have
it used to be. And uh we actually have
lots of new people now all the time that
lots of new people now all the time that
are getting involved with this type of
are getting involved with this type of
stuff that do not have prior RL
stuff that do not have prior RL
experience.
Plan for today is to fix the release box
Plan for today is to fix the release box
in. So if you have stuff that you want
in. So if you have stuff that you want
to get into the release on your
to get into the release on your
environment, get it in now,
environment, get it in now,
right now.
How's it possible to get involved?
How's it possible to get involved?
Very simple.
Very simple.
All this is on puffer.ai.
All this is on puffer.ai.
Start the repo on your way in. Helps me
Start the repo on your way in. Helps me
out. And then I don't know why our
out. And then I don't know why our
banner is broken, but if you just click
banner is broken, but if you just click
this discord.gg/puffer,
this discord.gg/puffer,
we've got like a thousand some odd
we've got like a thousand some odd
people in here. This is where we manage
people in here. This is where we manage
all the dev. Um, pretty much new people.
all the dev. Um, pretty much new people.
If you're trying to get into RL, uh, I
If you're trying to get into RL, uh, I
suggest you start just by following our
suggest you start just by following our
new environment tutorial. It's in the 3
new environment tutorial. It's in the 3
docs, which are beta, but they're coming
docs, which are beta, but they're coming
out and you can get them anyways early.
out and you can get them anyways early.
You build like a really simple
You build like a really simple
environment just to understand what is
environment just to understand what is
happening. Uh, and then you build up to
happening. Uh, and then you build up to
like more complex and interesting stuff.
like more complex and interesting stuff.
Uh, generally ways you can get involved.
Uh, generally ways you can get involved.
New contributors should build
New contributors should build
environments to see the endto-end loop
environments to see the endto-end loop
of like how do I get RL working on a new
of like how do I get RL working on a new
problem. Then after that as you get more
problem. Then after that as you get more
uh advanced you can work on harder
uh advanced you can work on harder
environments that actually help us test
environments that actually help us test
new areas of the science. You can get
new areas of the science. You can get
involved with optimizing and working on
involved with optimizing and working on
the algorithms and the science side in
the algorithms and the science side in
puffer or the infrastructure which is
puffer or the infrastructure which is
how we make everything run super fast.
how we make everything run super fast.
I have prior RL experience. Well, then
I have prior RL experience. Well, then
you're actually ahead of a lot of the
you're actually ahead of a lot of the
people in here. So, the thing that I
people in here. So, the thing that I
think most people that come in from the
think most people that come in from the
science side struggle with is the amount
science side struggle with is the amount
of low-level dev we do. Um,
of low-level dev we do. Um,
but like the low-level stuff, we do it
but like the low-level stuff, we do it
in a way that's very, very simple and
in a way that's very, very simple and
very, very powerful.
very, very powerful.
I have a summer to waste. Well, it's uh
I have a summer to waste. Well, it's uh
I don't think you'll quite call it
I don't think you'll quite call it
wasting because if you see what we've
wasting because if you see what we've
done in Puffer in just the last year,
done in Puffer in just the last year,
the field is totally different. Um I
the field is totally different. Um I
don't know how like if you've seen any
don't know how like if you've seen any
of the new stuff, but we literally have
of the new stuff, but we literally have
reinforcement learning working out of
reinforcement learning working out of
the box at millions of steps per second,
the box at millions of steps per second,
literally a thousand times faster than
literally a thousand times faster than
anything else in the field. Uh we have
anything else in the field. Uh we have
like 20 environments there. Many of them
like 20 environments there. Many of them
are more complex and interesting than
are more complex and interesting than
all the things being used in academia.
all the things being used in academia.
We have new algorithms. We have new
We have new algorithms. We have new
infrastructure. It's all simpler than
infrastructure. It's all simpler than
what's out there as well. Like yeah,
what's out there as well. Like yeah,
there's some really cool stuff happening
there's some really cool stuff happening
in RL right now. I graduated a year ago,
in RL right now. I graduated a year ago,
so I'm done with PhD and uh now I'm
so I'm done with PhD and uh now I'm
trying to fix the field and do so
trying to fix the field and do so
outside of the confines of academia.
outside of the confines of academia.
It's all open source as well.
Well, if you're interested in RL, this
Well, if you're interested in RL, this
is the
doing a masters in AI. I'm looking for
doing a masters in AI. I'm looking for
something in RL field for next year's
something in RL field for next year's
thesis. There's a lot of cool stuff you
thesis. There's a lot of cool stuff you
can do now. Do I have the schooling
can do now. Do I have the schooling
environment
environment
here?
I don't think I have a trained model on
I don't think I have a trained model on
this, but I can run this space. Like I
this, but I can run this space. Like I
built this thing in four days with
built this thing in four days with
latest puffer. Are you going to be able
latest puffer. Are you going to be able
to even
to even
here? Let me maybe
here? Let me maybe
I'll train it for you so you can
I'll train it for you so you can
actually see a little bit of what it
actually see a little bit of what it
does. Um so this is now going to train
does. Um so this is now going to train
in at 2 minutes at a million and a half
in at 2 minutes at a million and a half
steps per second. This is now keep in
steps per second. This is now keep in
mind this is a new environment that only
mind this is a new environment that only
took me about 4 days to build with um
took me about 4 days to build with um
the way that we do stuff in latest
the way that we do stuff in latest
puffer lib.
If you take like SP3 speeds for a
If you take like SP3 speeds for a
network this size, it would be uh
network this size, it would be uh
literally like you'd look at maybe 5,000
literally like you'd look at maybe 5,000
steps per second. So this is
steps per second. So this is
what's that 300x faster training and way
what's that 300x faster training and way
faster than that simulation.
And you'll see what this environment is
And you'll see what this environment is
in just a second.
in just a second.
We have lots of stuff like this as well.
Yeah, I'm basically cleaning up for our
Yeah, I'm basically cleaning up for our
next uh our next release. Oh, yeah. This
next uh our next release. Oh, yeah. This
is not even going to be the best policy
is not even going to be the best policy
cuz I I ran a hyper pram sweep. Uh that
cuz I I ran a hyper pram sweep. Uh that
should get us better stuff. But uh
should get us better stuff. But uh
hopefully this this will at least show
hopefully this this will at least show
you something cool.
Oh, and I do also I stream all the
Oh, and I do also I stream all the
development of puffer. So, I stream like
development of puffer. So, I stream like
40 60 hours a week. Um, pretty much all
40 60 hours a week. Um, pretty much all
the dev,
usually Monday through Saturday.
That'll be done in a minute. I mean I
That'll be done in a minute. I mean I
174 million steps is like and normally
174 million steps is like and normally
if you look most academic RL papers the
if you look most academic RL papers the
x-axis is like a 100 million steps or
x-axis is like a 100 million steps or
even 10 million steps and they run it
even 10 million steps and they run it
overnight. So kind of gives you an idea.
overnight. So kind of gives you an idea.
Heck I mean there are Atari 100k I think
Heck I mean there are Atari 100k I think
the Atari 100k
the Atari 100k
uh experiments where they will take two
uh experiments where they will take two
hours to run 100k frames. It's kind of
hours to run 100k frames. It's kind of
ridiculous.
Yeah,
I mean there are a few reasons I stream,
I mean there are a few reasons I stream,
right? One is actually to get people
right? One is actually to get people
interested in contributing to stuff like
interested in contributing to stuff like
this, but also it's that if people have
this, but also it's that if people have
questions on all these different things,
questions on all these different things,
I can like I can help and provide
I can like I can help and provide
support live for stuff.
Yeah. Well, I think the training was a
Yeah. Well, I think the training was a
bit unstable because it crashed right at
bit unstable because it crashed right at
the end, but uh I don't know. Maybe
the end, but uh I don't know. Maybe
they'll still do something.
Can we see these? I mean, we can still
Can we see these? I mean, we can still
see them. They're just not very smart.
see them. They're just not very smart.
So yeah, these are all agents
So yeah, these are all agents
individually controlled.
Probably see him fight in a second.
Probably see him fight in a second.
Yeah, there you go. You can see one of
Yeah, there you go. You can see one of
the lasers.
Yeah, like the little laser beams that
Yeah, like the little laser beams that
go off occasionally. environment just
go off occasionally. environment just
reset.
reset.
Yeah, we can build stuff like this now
Yeah, we can build stuff like this now
and actually RL it. It's pretty cool.
and actually RL it. It's pretty cool.
It'll be way more interesting when I
It'll be way more interesting when I
have a policy for it, but
have a policy for it, but
that's just a quick preview.
I mean, like a sim like that would kind
I mean, like a sim like that would kind
of be that's like the complexity of my
of be that's like the complexity of my
PhD thesis pretty much in terms of like
PhD thesis pretty much in terms of like
what the sim actually does. And instead
what the sim actually does. And instead
of taking five years, it took four days.
of taking five years, it took four days.
So that's how much like I basically what
So that's how much like I basically what
I did is I took everything I learned in
I did is I took everything I learned in
my PhD thesis and then over the last
my PhD thesis and then over the last

worked on them in like 2017 2018 I think
worked on them in like 2017 2018 I think

with new data, with more scale. I'm

trying to do the same thing for RL.

point where it just freaking takes off.
That's my goal.
All right, back to back to work on this.

So,
So,
some reason this doesn't look like it is

Hi.
Let me get the uh the chat set up here
and I'll talk about what we're going to
and I'll talk about what we're going to
do today.
One second.
One second.
This is going to be um
a heck of a work day.
So, we're basically going to try to get
So, we're basically going to try to get
everything done for release
everything done for release
except pressing the launch button.
except pressing the launch button.
Pretty much that.
So, what do we have to do to get there?
So, what do we have to do to get there?
Well, unfortunately, uh the jobs that we
Well, unfortunately, uh the jobs that we
had last night died because power
had last night died because power
outage, which is always fun. Uh we did

get some data though before they died.
get some data though before they died.
In particular, the latest stuff on
In particular, the latest stuff on
neural MMO looks very, very good.
all these different sweeps that I did.
all these different sweeps that I did.
And uh this one on Neural MMO.
Now, you never really want to bet too
Now, you never really want to bet too
much on these upticks at the end because
much on these upticks at the end because
um
um
there's like sampling bias. But if we
there's like sampling bias. But if we
even if we look sort of here at this
even if we look sort of here at this
sort of portion of the curve, I think
sort of portion of the curve, I think
it's very likely we get something above
it's very likely we get something above
seven in a reasonable amount of time.
seven in a reasonable amount of time.
And uh I don't know, we might end up
And uh I don't know, we might end up
actually seeing something way way better
actually seeing something way way better
if we run this for even longer. So I've
if we run this for even longer. So I've
started up this new one here. It's tiny.
started up this new one here. It's tiny.
Also a fair bit of variance from run to
Also a fair bit of variance from run to
run. So it's always not like it's not
run. So it's always not like it's not
always super easy to say. This is
always super easy to say. This is
literally the same run that I've started
literally the same run that I've started
and just it's bought on a little
and just it's bought on a little
quicker. Um but regardless, we'll see
quicker. Um but regardless, we'll see
what this does. There's also I've seen
what this does. There's also I've seen
some instability where some of these
some instability where some of these
runs uh kind of crash after a bit. So
runs uh kind of crash after a bit. So
like the reward crashes, but we'll see.
like the reward crashes, but we'll see.
You know, we'll monitor this throughout
You know, we'll monitor this throughout
the day and we'll hope that the uh there
the day and we'll hope that the uh there
are no more power interruptions.
are no more power interruptions.
I can guarantee there will be no more
I can guarantee there will be no more
power interruptions
power interruptions
in a few days because uh we're going to
in a few days because uh we're going to
have the UPS installed. It's a backup
have the UPS installed. It's a backup
generator. It's just that right now it
generator. It's just that right now it
doesn't switch over fast enough. So
doesn't switch over fast enough. So
that'll all be taken care of. Cool. Um,
let's actually just get the master list
let's actually just get the master list
real quick of like
real quick of like
things we need to do. Finally launch
things we need to do. Finally launch
this. Done with this launch. Way way way
this. Done with this launch. Way way way
too long. Want to move on and work on
too long. Want to move on and work on
other things around RL with Puffer.
don't have a todo in here anyways.
So
baselines

for all environments
for all environments
run

port all baselines
port all baselines
to website.
Um I am fine here.
Help.
I am fine here. Uh either
I am fine here. Uh either
downscale

I think the other main things we got to

double check. Whoops.
Double check examples
maybe around some of
maybe around some of
SPI

The new M's don't have articles,
The new M's don't have articles,
individual articles yet, but that will
individual articles yet, but that will
be resolved.
Other things I promised for release.
Other things I promised for release.
I mean, there's always going to be like
I mean, there's always going to be like
testing
pie
pie
going to be a pain.
Is there anything else?
Obviously
testing package install.
More than anything else, I just want
More than anything else, I just want
this to not be broken on release, right?
this to not be broken on release, right?
I don't want to not have a whole bunch
I don't want to not have a whole bunch
of support issues where we have like
of support issues where we have like
basic installation stuff or whatever.
I think that's kind of it.
I think that's kind of it.
What's going on with this thing? Oh,
What's going on with this thing? Oh,
okay.
okay.
Cool. Yeah, that does then. Um, that
Cool. Yeah, that does then. Um, that
already 1.5 bill. Yeah, that's crazy.
already 1.5 bill. Yeah, that's crazy.
Literally, while I've been talking, I

We have I believe this is yet new pong.

There is frame skip here, but we're
There is frame skip here, but we're
smoothing frames.
I believe we did the new enduro policy
I believe we did the new enduro policy
as well.
That was me playing.
I don't know what we do about snake.
So, we can get I'm sure we can get
So, we can get I'm sure we can get
reasonable policies for most of these
reasonable policies for most of these
things.
Why don't we just try real quick?
Oops.
Yeah. So this is the non-recurrent
You can just immediately see the
You can just immediately see the
difference, right?
difference, right?
with the recurrent policy. Hey.
Well, hang on. It's
Well, hang on. It's
there is a one hot requirement, right?
Try this.
not be multiplied.
Ah.
I will be right back.
So that runs cool. I'll be right back.
Oh, that's funny.
Oh, that's funny.
You don't need coms.
You don't need coms.
Isn't that funny?
Look at that.
Look at that.
You need you need the one hot encoder,
You need you need the one hot encoder,
but you actually don't need coms.
It's like barely makes a difference.
That's so funny.
3 million steps a second. 3.5. That's
3 million steps a second. 3.5. That's
lovely.
It does have like a decent chunk more
It does have like a decent chunk more
params, but like do we care? Faster.
I think what we're going to do,
I think what we're going to do,
let's do a Billy.
Yes, rewards are automatically being
Yes, rewards are automatically being
clipped to negative one to one in the uh
clipped to negative one to one in the uh
Puffarel file. And the reason for that,
Puffarel file. And the reason for that,
we did that after we spent forever
we did that after we spent forever
trying to figure out why breakout
trying to figure out why breakout
wouldn't work. And it ended up being a
wouldn't work. And it ended up being a
wrapper difference. And I decided screw
wrapper difference. And I decided screw
it. we're going to clip all the rewards
it. we're going to clip all the rewards
and then you can tune around it. Um, and
and then you can tune around it. Um, and
if your env has bigger reward
if your env has bigger reward
magnitudes, you should probably fix
magnitudes, you should probably fix
that.
that.
So, what I would suggest instead is you
So, what I would suggest instead is you
change the reward magnitudes of the
change the reward magnitudes of the
other ones to probably be smaller. You
other ones to probably be smaller. You
are going to have to tune because like
are going to have to tune because like
the defaults, the defaults kind of
the defaults, the defaults kind of
assume that you're roughly in the oneish
assume that you're roughly in the oneish
reward range. Like I tend to use things
reward range. Like I tend to use things
between maybe 0.1 at the very lowest and
between maybe 0.1 at the very lowest and
uh one at the highest or negative one to
uh one at the highest or negative one to
one but like 0.1 is the smallest uh
one but like 0.1 is the smallest uh
distinguisher from zero.
distinguisher from zero.
Also yo Spencer it turns out you don't
Also yo Spencer it turns out you don't
need coms for snake you just need the uh
need coms for snake you just need the uh
the one hot encoder.
the one hot encoder.
So I think we actually are going to be
So I think we actually are going to be
able to make a lot of the network
able to make a lot of the network
architectures way faster if we do this.
architectures way faster if we do this.
Um, hell, I might Yeah, I have all sorts
Um, hell, I might Yeah, I have all sorts
of things I can do with this now. It's
of things I can do with this now. It's
kind of funny.
It turns out you don't need coms when
It turns out you don't need coms when
you have this much data.
Yeah. So, it's you do need the uh you
Yeah. So, it's you do need the uh you
need the one hot encoding.
need the one hot encoding.
And actually, I'm going to do this for
And actually, I'm going to do this for
our default nets for now. Even though I
our default nets for now. Even though I
the com is like technically kind of
the com is like technically kind of
smarter. Uh the reason I'm going to do
smarter. Uh the reason I'm going to do
this for default nets is that they run
this for default nets is that they run
faster. So, I can actually run these on
faster. So, I can actually run these on
the web way easier
global. Well, it's not necessarily that
global. Well, it's not necessarily that
coms are bad. It's just um
coms are bad. It's just um
at least the way we have them now,
at least the way we have them now,
they're kind of slow, you know?
they're kind of slow, you know?
Like coms are not a bad building block
Like coms are not a bad building block
for what like we we should probably do
for what like we we should probably do
like some perf engineering at some
like some perf engineering at some
point. I don't know. There's so many
point. I don't know. There's so many
things I can potentially work on with
things I can potentially work on with
this stuff.
this stuff.
We need to like just knock down uh a
We need to like just knock down uh a
couple contracts or whatever so we can
couple contracts or whatever so we can
get back to like really hammering the
get back to like really hammering the
fundamentals.
Uh, today will be a long is going to be
Uh, today will be a long is going to be
like long work day for me and I'm going
like long work day for me and I'm going
to attempt to get basically everything
to attempt to get basically everything
all the remaining crap done for release.
all the remaining crap done for release.
So, we're basically ready to just do it.
So, we're basically ready to just do it.
whether I actually launch tomorrow or
whether I actually launch tomorrow or
whether we decide that we uh want to get
whether we decide that we uh want to get
like a trailer cut together or stuff.
like a trailer cut together or stuff.
We'll see about that. But yeah.
No, it's from I see I've seen people do
No, it's from I see I've seen people do
this. Actually, I have a client that's
this. Actually, I have a client that's
done this. Um people will put like point
done this. Um people will put like point
like negative.
like negative.
Z5 or like 0001
Z5 or like 0001
and like they'll wonder why the thing
and like they'll wonder why the thing
isn't getting picked up. Like that's
isn't getting picked up. Like that's
basically going to get ignored unless
basically going to get ignored unless
you have unless you have some other
you have unless you have some other
hyperparameter that's effectively
hyperparameter that's effectively
scaling that thing up massively. Like
scaling that thing up massively. Like
that ain't gonna do anything.
There's no actual clipping happening
There's no actual clipping happening
like that's going to one or anything.
like that's going to one or anything.
It's just negative one to one as the
It's just negative one to one as the
only clip.
only clip.
That helps.
Let me actually DM uh

It's big.
It's actually human playable. So, if I
It's actually human playable. So, if I

in building stuff like this. It is uh
in building stuff like this. It is uh
well, I won't say it's not hard, but
well, I won't say it's not hard, but
I've made it a heck of a lot easier than

people in here. This is where we manage
all the dev. Um, pretty much new people.
all the dev. Um, pretty much new people.
If you're trying to get into RL, uh, I
If you're trying to get into RL, uh, I
suggest you start just by following our
suggest you start just by following our
new environment tutorial. It's in the 3
new environment tutorial. It's in the 3
docs, which are beta, but they're coming

out and you can get them anyways early.
out and you can get them anyways early.
You build like a really simple
You build like a really simple
environment just to understand what is
environment just to understand what is
happening. Uh, and then you build up to
happening. Uh, and then you build up to
like more complex and interesting stuff.
like more complex and interesting stuff.
Uh, generally ways you can get involved.
Uh, generally ways you can get involved.
New contributors should build
New contributors should build
environments to see the endto-end loop
environments to see the endto-end loop
of like how do I get RL working on a new
of like how do I get RL working on a new
problem. Then after that as you get more
problem. Then after that as you get more
uh advanced you can work on harder
uh advanced you can work on harder
environments that actually help us test
environments that actually help us test
new areas of the science. You can get
new areas of the science. You can get
involved with optimizing and working on

how we make everything run super fast.
how we make everything run super fast.
I have prior RL experience. Well, then
I have prior RL experience. Well, then
you're actually ahead of a lot of the
you're actually ahead of a lot of the
people in here. So, the thing that I
people in here. So, the thing that I
think most people that come in from the
think most people that come in from the
science side struggle with is the amount
science side struggle with is the amount
of low-level dev we do. Um,
of low-level dev we do. Um,
but like the low-level stuff, we do it
but like the low-level stuff, we do it
in a way that's very, very simple and
in a way that's very, very simple and
very, very powerful.
very, very powerful.
I have a summer to waste. Well, it's uh
I have a summer to waste. Well, it's uh
I don't think you'll quite call it
I don't think you'll quite call it
wasting because if you see what we've
wasting because if you see what we've
done in Puffer in just the last year,
done in Puffer in just the last year,
the field is totally different. Um I
the field is totally different. Um I
don't know how like if you've seen any
don't know how like if you've seen any
of the new stuff, but we literally have
of the new stuff, but we literally have
reinforcement learning working out of
reinforcement learning working out of
the box at millions of steps per second,
the box at millions of steps per second,
literally a thousand times faster than
literally a thousand times faster than
anything else in the field. Uh we have
anything else in the field. Uh we have
like 20 environments there. Many of them
like 20 environments there. Many of them
are more complex and interesting than
are more complex and interesting than
all the things being used in academia.
all the things being used in academia.
We have new algorithms. We have new
We have new algorithms. We have new
infrastructure. It's all simpler than
infrastructure. It's all simpler than
what's out there as well. Like yeah,
what's out there as well. Like yeah,
there's some really cool stuff happening
there's some really cool stuff happening
in RL right now. I graduated a year ago,
in RL right now. I graduated a year ago,
so I'm done with PhD and uh now I'm
so I'm done with PhD and uh now I'm
trying to fix the field and do so
trying to fix the field and do so
outside of the confines of academia.
outside of the confines of academia.
It's all open source as well.
Well, if you're interested in RL, this
Well, if you're interested in RL, this
is the
doing a masters in AI. I'm looking for
doing a masters in AI. I'm looking for
something in RL field for next year's
something in RL field for next year's
thesis. There's a lot of cool stuff you
thesis. There's a lot of cool stuff you
can do now. Do I have the schooling
can do now. Do I have the schooling
environment
environment
here?
I don't think I have a trained model on
I don't think I have a trained model on
this, but I can run this space. Like I
this, but I can run this space. Like I
built this thing in four days with
built this thing in four days with
latest puffer. Are you going to be able
latest puffer. Are you going to be able
to even
to even
here? Let me maybe
here? Let me maybe
I'll train it for you so you can
I'll train it for you so you can
actually see a little bit of what it
actually see a little bit of what it
does. Um so this is now going to train
does. Um so this is now going to train
in at 2 minutes at a million and a half
in at 2 minutes at a million and a half
steps per second. This is now keep in
steps per second. This is now keep in
mind this is a new environment that only
mind this is a new environment that only
took me about 4 days to build with um
took me about 4 days to build with um
the way that we do stuff in latest
the way that we do stuff in latest
puffer lib.
If you take like SP3 speeds for a
If you take like SP3 speeds for a
network this size, it would be uh
network this size, it would be uh
literally like you'd look at maybe 5,000
literally like you'd look at maybe 5,000
steps per second. So this is
steps per second. So this is
what's that 300x faster training and way
what's that 300x faster training and way
faster than that simulation.
And you'll see what this environment is
And you'll see what this environment is
in just a second.
in just a second.
We have lots of stuff like this as well.
Yeah, I'm basically cleaning up for our
Yeah, I'm basically cleaning up for our
next uh our next release. Oh, yeah. This
next uh our next release. Oh, yeah. This
is not even going to be the best policy
is not even going to be the best policy
cuz I I ran a hyper pram sweep. Uh that
cuz I I ran a hyper pram sweep. Uh that
should get us better stuff. But uh
should get us better stuff. But uh
hopefully this this will at least show
hopefully this this will at least show
you something cool.
Oh, and I do also I stream all the
Oh, and I do also I stream all the
development of puffer. So, I stream like
development of puffer. So, I stream like
40 60 hours a week. Um, pretty much all
40 60 hours a week. Um, pretty much all
the dev,
usually Monday through Saturday.
That'll be done in a minute. I mean I
That'll be done in a minute. I mean I
174 million steps is like and normally
174 million steps is like and normally
if you look most academic RL papers the
if you look most academic RL papers the
x-axis is like a 100 million steps or
x-axis is like a 100 million steps or
even 10 million steps and they run it
even 10 million steps and they run it
overnight. So kind of gives you an idea.
overnight. So kind of gives you an idea.
Heck I mean there are Atari 100k I think
Heck I mean there are Atari 100k I think
the Atari 100k
the Atari 100k
uh experiments where they will take two
uh experiments where they will take two
hours to run 100k frames. It's kind of
hours to run 100k frames. It's kind of
ridiculous.
Yeah,
I mean there are a few reasons I stream,
I mean there are a few reasons I stream,
right? One is actually to get people
right? One is actually to get people
interested in contributing to stuff like
interested in contributing to stuff like
this, but also it's that if people have
this, but also it's that if people have
questions on all these different things,
questions on all these different things,
I can like I can help and provide
I can like I can help and provide
support live for stuff.
Yeah. Well, I think the training was a
Yeah. Well, I think the training was a
bit unstable because it crashed right at
bit unstable because it crashed right at
the end, but uh I don't know. Maybe
the end, but uh I don't know. Maybe
they'll still do something.
Can we see these? I mean, we can still
Can we see these? I mean, we can still
see them. They're just not very smart.
see them. They're just not very smart.
So yeah, these are all agents
So yeah, these are all agents
individually controlled.
Probably see him fight in a second.
Probably see him fight in a second.
Yeah, there you go. You can see one of
Yeah, there you go. You can see one of
the lasers.
Yeah, like the little laser beams that
Yeah, like the little laser beams that
go off occasionally. environment just
go off occasionally. environment just
reset.
reset.
Yeah, we can build stuff like this now
Yeah, we can build stuff like this now
and actually RL it. It's pretty cool.
and actually RL it. It's pretty cool.
It'll be way more interesting when I
It'll be way more interesting when I
have a policy for it, but
have a policy for it, but
that's just a quick preview.
I mean, like a sim like that would kind
I mean, like a sim like that would kind
of be that's like the complexity of my
of be that's like the complexity of my
PhD thesis pretty much in terms of like
PhD thesis pretty much in terms of like
what the sim actually does. And instead
what the sim actually does. And instead
of taking five years, it took four days.
of taking five years, it took four days.
So that's how much like I basically what
So that's how much like I basically what
I did is I took everything I learned in
I did is I took everything I learned in
my PhD thesis and then over the last
my PhD thesis and then over the last
year um I've made I've just made the
year um I've made I've just made the
process of doing of making complex
process of doing of making complex
environments and training on them. I've
environments and training on them. I've
done like everything's a thousandx
done like everything's a thousandx
better.
So this is my goal, right? This is my
So this is my goal, right? This is my
goal is to fix the field to make
goal is to fix the field to make
reinforcement learning uh like a stable

language modeling didn't used to work
language modeling didn't used to work
like LLMs they didn't used to work. I
like LLMs they didn't used to work. I
worked on them in like 2017 2018 I think
worked on them in like 2017 2018 I think
2017 and like you could like see the
2017 and like you could like see the
loss curve go down but the output was
loss curve go down but the output was
pretty garbage and you could like barely
pretty garbage and you could like barely
use them for stuff like sentiment
use them for stuff like sentiment
analysis. Uh, and then eventually, you

know, they kind of just started working
know, they kind of just started working
with all the new architecture changes,
with all the new architecture changes,
with new data, with more scale. I'm
with new data, with more scale. I'm
trying to do the same thing for RL.
trying to do the same thing for RL.
Like, it's, if you think of RL as being

where that was back then, I'm trying to
where that was back then, I'm trying to
do the same thing. Like, get it to this
do the same thing. Like, get it to this
point where it just freaking takes off.
That's my goal.
All right, back to back to work on this.
All right, back to back to work on this.
So,
So,
some reason this doesn't look like it is
some reason this doesn't look like it is
working

right?
Yeah. This is not the policy or the
