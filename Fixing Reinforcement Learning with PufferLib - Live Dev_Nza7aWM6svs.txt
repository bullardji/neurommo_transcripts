hello we are back
hello we are back
live it's only a bit past
live it's only a bit past
7 probably got a good couple hours to
7 probably got a good couple hours to
keep coding on
this this is driving me nuts but maybe
this this is driving me nuts but maybe
we get it running today who
knows let's go through this a little bit
knows let's go through this a little bit
so
it could be time to just start trying to
it could be time to just start trying to
get it running
actually the observations are not uh not
actually the observations are not uh not
there yet I
know got to add
that ooh this OBS buff is not a thing
that ooh this OBS buff is not a thing
either
aren ref
OBS I don't like this
OBS I don't like this
thing next
TS and where do these functions come
TS and where do these functions come
from maybe there's a fair bit of extra
from maybe there's a fair bit of extra
work to do do
here
well oh no it isn't here
okay it is in
here so I just forgot these two
here so I just forgot these two
functions I
functions I
guess torch jit script is
commented going to comment it here as
commented going to comment it here as
well
what
rotate the import Star is just the
rotate the import Star is just the
cherry on top
here from utils import Okay so [ __ ] this
here from utils import Okay so [ __ ] this
is their
yous no my guy that's a
yous no my guy that's a
scam that's not a the coin's not me I
scam that's not a the coin's not me I
don't have cryptos I don't have crypto
and this isn't a donation funded project
either no I there's like why would
I no it's not so all of our stuff is
I no it's not so all of our stuff is
open source but puffer is a startup we
open source but puffer is a startup we
sell service packages to companies the
sell service packages to companies the
idea is that if you're doing
idea is that if you're doing
reinforcement learning and having a hard
reinforcement learning and having a hard
time with it we can
help after all why wouldn't you want to
help after all why wouldn't you want to
have the people who are uh building the
have the people who are uh building the
highest performance easiest to use most
highest performance easiest to use most
stable reinforcement learning tools out
stable reinforcement learning tools out
there on your
there on your
side dude I can I can raise millions of
side dude I can I can raise millions of
dollars for my company right right now
dollars for my company right right now
if I want to I don't want VC funding
if I want to I don't want VC funding
because I don't want the strings
because I don't want the strings
attached to
it puffer intentionally bootstrapped for
it puffer intentionally bootstrapped for
that
reason it's not like I hate money I want
reason it's not like I hate money I want
puffer to be profitable but uh the
puffer to be profitable but uh the
research comes first you know the goal
research comes first you know the goal
is to revolutionize reinforcement
is to revolutionize reinforcement
learning we're going to make stuff fast
learning we're going to make stuff fast
we're make stuff stable we're going to
we're make stuff stable we're going to
make stuff easy to use and it's all
make stuff easy to use and it's all
happening this year thank
you I mean if you take a look at some of
you I mean if you take a look at some of
the stuff that we've done just in the
the stuff that we've done just in the
last six months you'll see it you'll
last six months you'll see it you'll
definitely see
it and we have made so much progress in
it and we have made so much progress in
just the last six months
just the last six months
I mean we now have stuff that's running
I mean we now have stuff that's running
training in a million steps per second
training in a million steps per second
tons of different environments various
tons of different environments various
complexities and brand new people to
complexities and brand new people to
reinforcement learning can write them
reinforcement learning can write them
that is something that was like so far
that is something that was like so far
out of the realm of existence 6 months
out of the realm of existence 6 months
ago it's not even funny
they don't have the full API it looks
they don't have the full API it looks
like am I wrong here is
like am I wrong here is
this any one
Isaac Jim Tor you
tells okay so Isaac Jim does have a
tells okay so Isaac Jim does have a
torch you
torch you
tells um
let's see if these uh these
work we'll get rid of all the ones of
work we'll get rid of all the ones of
these that we don't
these that we don't
need oh my
gosh so much garbage in here
okay and now we have to do torch
and there should be a two torch in
here why is there no two torch in
here did kung add this
it's right here did I just miss it where
it's right here did I just miss it where
did K add
it compute humanoid reward compute
it compute humanoid reward compute
humanoid reset
there's more [ __ ] in
there's more [ __ ] in
here they just they have so much
freaking like what the hell is this
I mean they just have too much code like
I mean they just have too much code like
this is a ridiculous reward function
this is a ridiculous reward function
what is
this let's see what's still missing in
this let's see what's still missing in
here yeah this one
okay if I scroll through
okay if I scroll through
this should be nothing undefined I think
this should be nothing undefined I think
I have to import OS and a couple small
I have to import OS and a couple small
Li
is
okay
TCH is hoi and then I guess this make
TCH is hoi and then I guess this make
function this make function gets much
function this make function gets much
easier now because we just do like this
literally don't need any of this
freaking crazy
oops oh that's the wrong one it's
it is this
one okay
good we're getting somewhere
th000
th000
lines we'll be able to cut some of
lines we'll be able to cut some of
this for reference the original is over
this for reference the original is over
2,000
so we've uh We've cut the code down a
so we've uh We've cut the code down a
lot still have a little more to go
but for
it should just be
um render right or something
I got to go back into the freaking the
I got to go back into the freaking the
base class
again okay it's viewers none so this is
again okay it's viewers none so this is
m. viewer
uh right here yes n so it's going to be
uh right here yes n so it's going to be
n
viewer and why is n not here there
viewer and why is n not here there
should
be M up viewer
we'll just do self view or S and
viewer get access
pams let's just
just looking for
yellow do we have after root state
um looking for
yellow okay at least
yellow okay at least
everything outside self is defined
we're going to have to test this a
we're going to have to test this a
bunch let's commit it first
okay so we're going to
make for
and now I got to grab these annoying
pams I
pams I
mean can I not just do
wait what
where I could just make them
where I could just make them
default it irritates me a little bit to
default it irritates me a little bit to
duplicate but
duplicate but
like control headless
device all right and his eyes
again we do was it
headless step
n no module
oh yeah JY torch is an Isaac Puck we got
oh yeah JY torch is an Isaac Puck we got
to figure that
out R
tensor okay all I need is wrap tensor
tensor okay all I need is wrap tensor
and unwrap tensor from this
dude how is
dude how is
this RP tenser
rap tensor
has yeah
[ __ ] C++ build is really obnoxious
you know wait a
second there should be something built
second there should be something built
into Isaac for this right did these just
into Isaac for this right did these just
got did these guys just write their own
got did these guys just write their own
dumb thing for no
dumb thing for no
reason hang on
I'm pretty sure the tensor API
hey how's it
going currently trying to make Isaac Jim
going currently trying to make Isaac Jim
work without being
work without being
ridiculous okay this is not Isaac Jim is
ridiculous okay this is not Isaac Jim is
not
not
here this is an external
tensor API
maybe wait gym torch wrap
tensor using the provided gym torch
tensor using the provided gym torch
interop module
so this should be an Isaac gy
right why is it outside of Isaac
gy wait there it is it's in gym torch
wrap tensor yeah it's right
here my your work currently studying
here my your work currently studying
CS hey feel free to get involved it's
CS hey feel free to get involved it's
all open source stuff um you know we
all open source stuff um you know we
have people that come in with just a
have people that come in with just a
programming background and within a
programming background and within a
month or two are implementing a really
month or two are implementing a really
awesome
awesome
environments you know they're all right
environments you know they're all right
here
I mean most of them are written by

contributors I wrote a few of the more
contributors I wrote a few of the more
complex ones nur3 and

MOA doing crypto while I'm on
break you know the uh the token is not
break you know the uh the token is not
mine um I made an announcement about
mine um I made an announcement about
that that's just somebody impersonating
me I would generally suggest staying out
me I would generally suggest staying out
of that space
it's really just infested with
scammers much more fun stuff going on in
scammers much more fun stuff going on in
AI much much more fun stuff going on in
AI rap tensor imple okay so this is
AI rap tensor imple okay so this is
imported but it's not getting
imported but it's not getting
called wait
let me say so from Isaac Jim
let me say so from Isaac Jim
import gym
torch dis
packages okay so why is it trying to

open from there
user local lib
okay it's not there so I don't know why
okay it's not there so I don't know why
it's
there I mean I'm sure this is not going
there I mean I'm sure this is not going
to help
to help
but you never know
maybe this has been
maybe this has been
solved and indexed by GPT
manually
copy seriously
this search thing is
this search thing is
nice yeah this is
resolved I don't know how this is
resolved I don't know how this is
supposed to work but whatever
bright
bright
side can't really get
scammed it's really
scammed it's really
not I have infinitely many better ways
not I have infinitely many better ways
to make

where the heck is
Source I have a source folder oh wait
Source I have a source folder oh wait
hold on maybe this is the issue where is
this oh the file's not

small amount but you know it'll grow
we've only been open for business for a
we've only been open for business for a
few months the goal is going to be to
few months the goal is going to be to
get this year to get about five active

cool stuff to throw back to people soon
cool stuff to throw back to people soon
I've got uh there's one upcoming project
I've got uh there's one upcoming project
that's going to with uh with NYU that
that's going to with uh with NYU that
actually I think Spencer either you or
actually I think Spencer either you or
Captain would be great for that comes
Captain would be great for that comes
with
with
authorship um so that's pretty cool and
authorship um so that's pretty cool and
I'm working to generate a few more
I'm working to generate a few more
opportunities as well getting some
opportunities as well getting some
meetings lined
meetings lined
up business side of [ __ ]
yeah so the uh the ideas spener now this
yeah so the uh the ideas spener now this
isn't confirmed we're going to chat
isn't confirmed we're going to chat
about this in a couple of weeks after uh
about this in a couple of weeks after uh
they finish their conference stuff but
they finish their conference stuff but
um really the GPU engine is not doing
um really the GPU engine is not doing
them any favors we're thinking about
them any favors we're thinking about
just was doing a straight Port uh as an
just was doing a straight Port uh as an
ocean EnV of a GPU Drive making it like
ocean EnV of a GPU Drive making it like
20x

faster so then they'd be able to like
faster so then they'd be able to like
base all their research on this way
base all their research on this way
faster thing integrate puffer neoc carbs

basically pull it into our ecosystem
basically pull it into our ecosystem
pull the environment Dev into our
pull the environment Dev into our

I I just don't have any interest in
I I just don't have any interest in
interacting with the crypto space
man I really
don't there's so much more cool stuff
don't there's so much more cool stuff
over

the RL side is starting to get good

enough that like you know we've actually
enough that like you know we've actually
got a pretty solid proposition for
companies look like I I own like a small
companies look like I I own like a small
number of ETFs with some Bitcoin and
number of ETFs with some Bitcoin and
stuff but that's about as much as I do
stuff but that's about as much as I do
and that's like a very small part
that sounds up my alley can you give me
that sounds up my alley can you give me
a quick rundown it's a GPU Accel

that handles some of the physics and
that handles some of the physics and
stuff so the idea would either to be

Port it to use either box 2D or
Port it to use either box 2D or
depending on how simple the physics is
depending on how simple the physics is
maybe just our own
maybe just our own
stuff um so we have to replace some of
stuff um so we have to replace some of
the physics from adona but other than
the physics from adona but other than
that like their source is only a couple
that like their source is only a couple
thousand lines I don't think it would be
thousand lines I don't think it would be
any longer in C I think it would be way
any longer in C I think it would be way
faster because they handle like variable
faster because they handle like variable
numbers of cars and stuff with fix size

tensors with very low density which is

really bad for them um yeah bunch of
stuff I mean I only really have a small
stuff I mean I only really have a small
amount of Bitcoin it's like I don't know
amount of Bitcoin it's like I don't know
it's for me it's not as interesting I'd
it's for me it's not as interesting I'd
rather have like Nvidia and Tesla you

diversification stuff but I don't do
diversification stuff but I don't do
very much I don't day trade I just I
very much I don't day trade I just I
don't even look at them right I just
don't even look at them right I just
have some stocks and I just leave them
have some stocks and I just leave them
there for
years I really don't think about them
years I really don't think about them
much
I'm more interested at the moment in
I'm more interested at the moment in
figuring out how to get recurring

other RL PhD students for contributors
other RL PhD students for contributors
generates lots of cool
stuff let me know yeah no I mean I've
stuff let me know yeah no I mean I've
been supporting them for a while now and
been supporting them for a while now and
it's just like we've gotten to a point
it's just like we've gotten to a point
where I've optimized the heck out of
where I've optimized the heck out of
their environment and it's become very

Investments aren't the same thing um
Investments aren't the same thing um
these are two very different things like
these are two very different things like
having Investments That generate Revenue

yeah we've got 500k in Revenue because
yeah we've got 500k in Revenue because
it's like you know sitting in an ETF
it's like you know sitting in an ETF
right that's not how it
works that's not how it
works see the goal here here right is to

then it builds on itself that's what we

do
and then the more companies right that

about
about
2019 and it's not like we really got
2019 and it's not like we really got
stuck or anything all that happened is

a lot of the good people moved over to

there's not going to be progress unless
there's not going to be progress unless
you make there be progress I mean this
you make there be progress I mean this
is just how I see
things right I don't get up in the

need Okay um
need Okay um
is this enough or do I have to re I
is this enough or do I have to re I
might have to recompile I don't know it
might have to recompile I don't know it
depends it might Hot
Load okay I do have to
I do have to recompile this hold hold
on local
docks
okay oh
wait Isaac
wait Isaac
gem not quite it's got to
be hang on
yeah so we do this
okay so it's not getting copied
okay so it's not getting copied
over but
Yik my
Go hip install oh
Go hip install oh
wait yeah you have to go
wait yeah you have to go
here on 3.8
here on 3.8
dmall try this
Isaac come
Isaac come
on still no
Isaac oh I
Isaac oh I
remember yeah I remember
remember yeah I remember
so very weird I think you got to
so very weird I think you got to
do install dot doesn't work with Dash e
do install dot doesn't work with Dash e
for some reason yeah there we go now
for some reason yeah there we go now
it's building the
wheel and then this should work
we're going to have to package this
we're going to have to package this
thing up in a container like it is such
thing up in a container like it is such
a
pain still no
file pissing me off here
now it has underscore bindings but it
now it has underscore bindings but it
doesn't
doesn't
have still doesn't have
Source very
weird um
collect files Isaac Jim
SL okay
SL okay
so package
so package
files collect files Isaac
files collect files Isaac
Jim bindings Linux
X Plus
collect how about
collect how about
this does this work
really
should welcome YouTube
folks currently this is Isaac Jim very

it has about three generations of PhD
it has about three generations of PhD
students worth of horrible wrapper code
students worth of horrible wrapper code
so we're trying to clean everything up
so we're trying to clean everything up
get it running nicely and very fast with
get it running nicely and very fast with
puffer lib so that we can do all sorts
puffer lib so that we can do all sorts
of things with
of things with
it but it is a pain
oh is that
it
where numpy has no attribute float
does this specify a
version
1.6.4
e I have no idea what happens if we try
e I have no idea what happens if we try
to install numpy
1.20 or
1.20 or
1.16 we'll see if puffer lib still
1.16 we'll see if puffer lib still
works and that's super
old that's a bug there you can just fix
old that's a bug there you can just fix
the
the
type can I it's in uh I guess I can fix
type can I it's in uh I guess I can fix
it in their code we just have a fork or
it in their code we just have a fork or
it's not even a fork because they
uh what is
uh what is
this hey
this hey
K I hope this is helpful I've been
K I hope this is helpful I've been
working on this [ __ ] all day
is a pain I've got it down it's going to
is a pain I've got it down it's going to
be about half the length it was before
be about half the length it was before
though it looks
like they really had a bunch of

whoops isolated gym torch
did you change some
did you change some
stuff or is it just that one thing
stuff or is it just that one thing
should I go grab
should I go grab
it cuz I noticed that
it cuz I noticed that
um some of these
repos they have like their own gym torch
repos they have like their own gym torch
instead of the Isaac one which I assume
instead of the Isaac one which I assume
is because of the Isaac setup
error thanks for explaining what we're

doing so once we clean the mess up what
doing so once we clean the mess up what
kinds of things I mean Isaac Tim is a

general purpose physics simulator right
general purpose physics simulator right
it does humanoids it does like ant it
it does humanoids it does like ant it
does tons of different things it's
does tons of different things it's
pretty fast um it's a high fidelity
pretty fast um it's a high fidelity
simulator there are like successors to
simulator there are like successors to
it but actually a lot of people still
it but actually a lot of people still
use this one cuz the successors are
use this one cuz the successors are
pretty
pretty
finicky um I mean generally this will
finicky um I mean generally this will
expand puffer into High Fidelity physics
expand puffer into High Fidelity physics
uh just among the environments that we
uh just among the environments that we
support so so you can actually do like
support so so you can actually do like
pretty solid control got to go join more
pretty solid control got to go join more
often speak if you're interested just
often speak if you're interested just
shoot me a follow see you around thanks
shoot me a follow see you around thanks
for dropping
by using Isaac gy torch doesn't let me
by using Isaac gy torch doesn't let me
use vs code so I isolated compile and
use vs code so I isolated compile and
import
import
local I
local I
see I guess that
see I guess that
works it's just annoying to have to
works it's just annoying to have to
distribute it with puff like you have to
distribute it with puff like you have to
distribute it with puffer Li then
distribute it with puffer Li then
right unless you make a separate pit
right unless you make a separate pit
package out of gym
torch is that what you
torch is that what you
did you need to have a standalone gym
did you need to have a standalone gym
torch pip package
or the yeah but if you put it in the end
or the yeah but if you put it in the end
repo you got to distribute gym torch
repo you got to distribute gym torch
with puffer lib which I don't even think
with puffer lib which I don't even think
you can do cuz that's Nvidia code I
you can do cuz that's Nvidia code I
don't even think you can do that
my
God I mean this is
running and then some of these are are
running and then some of these are are
not actually so let's let's go
not actually so let's let's go

make sure it renders as well in the
make sure it renders as well in the
docker I haven't gotten there yet um to

give you an idea so this is 959 lines I
give you an idea so this is 959 lines I
haven't optimized any of these we
haven't optimized any of these we
probably don't need all of these so
probably don't need all of these so
really the
really the
the core environment code that we're
the core environment code that we're
dealing with
dealing with
here okay so this
here okay so this
is this is their old like the Fizz hoi
is this is their old like the Fizz hoi
humanoid en I think it was 600 some odd
humanoid en I think it was 600 some odd
lines I've gotten it down to 323 lines

and then the base environment
and then the base environment
here I've gotten it down to 130 109
here I've gotten it down to 130 109
lines so
lines so
it's substantially shorter than
before and it doesn't have a million

either cannot change and
either cannot change and
distribute Isaac Jim preview
what's the license on Isaac
Jim Isaac Sim is
Jim Isaac Sim is
uh Isaac Jim is open source it's Apache
uh Isaac Jim is open source it's Apache
oh maybe we can distribute gy torch then
actually wait yeah yeah yeah we can
actually wait yeah yeah yeah we can
distribute
this so we can do whichever to be fair I
this so we can do whichever to be fair I
still think it's better to not have to
still think it's better to not have to
include all the freaking gym torch and
include all the freaking gym torch and
puffer
puffer
lib you know I figure that it would be
lib you know I figure that it would be
probably what we should do is we just
probably what we should do is we just
should have um you know we should just
should have um you know we should just
have a download of of Isaac gym that
have a download of of Isaac gym that
works that's fixed up and we'll just
works that's fixed up and we'll just
stick it on a container for them we'll
stick it on a container for them we'll
probably will put it on our main
probably will put it on our main
container as well just so people can use
it but it won't be in puffer
it but it won't be in puffer
lib I think that's the best thing to do
where did I get this numb inner
where did I get this numb inner
iterations from where I got it from
somewhere downloading
somewhere downloading
installing well this is why we'd put it
installing well this is why we'd put it
on a container I mean cuz like
on a container I mean cuz like
regardless they're going to have to set

up Isaac gy right like they have to set
up Isaac gy right like they have to set
it up regardless we're not we can't

bundle Isaac Jim itself with puffer lib
bundle Isaac Jim itself with puffer lib
so like regardless of whether we put gym
so like regardless of whether we put gym
torch like there's no point in putting
torch like there's no point in putting
gym torch in puffer lib cuz we can just
gym torch in puffer lib cuz we can just
fix it and I ISAC in fact I fixed it in
fix it and I ISAC in fact I fixed it in
Isaac with one line I don't know if you
Isaac with one line I don't know if you
saw
um all I did
was I just
was I just
added uh the source files right here so
added uh the source files right here so
it actually moves the source files to
it actually moves the source files to
the correct spot that's all so we can
the correct spot that's all so we can
totally just like have a version of this
totally just like have a version of this
we distribute that's just already
we distribute that's just already
pre-installed on the docker container
pre-installed on the docker container
right and then we'll just hand the
right and then we'll just hand the
client the docker container people can
client the docker container people can
use it through Docker or if they want to
use it through Docker or if they want to
install our version separately they can
install our version separately they can
do that as
well wait what the heck
they just had the license on
they just had the license on
uh where the hell is the
license Omni verse Isaac
Sim I thought it
was Isaac lab is open
was Isaac lab is open
sourced is Isaac Sim not open
source is it called
source is it called
Isaac is this what it is Omniverse Isaac
Isaac is this what it is Omniverse Isaac
Sim
is a
is a

where the heck is the license on the
uh whatever it's like three minor
uh whatever it's like three minor
changes if we have to distribute a like
changes if we have to distribute a like
a PO install script or whatever we will
let me double check
let me double check
this they open sourced it but then they
this they open sourced it but then they
have a weird license
Isaac Jim
python
Nvidia but they open source the thing
Nvidia but they open source the thing
how can they they release the code but
how can they they release the code but
say you can't use it
say you can't use it
how does that make any sense
the heck is the license like this
the heck is the license like this
doesn't make
sense is it Omniverse is that different
we kind of got to figure this out
open source
I don't understand the
license e
this seems like something we have to
this seems like something we have to
bring up
right e
did I get
did I get
off
off
okay
um I'll keep on this for a bit I this is
um I'll keep on this for a bit I this is
we're this doesn't affect us at the very
we're this doesn't affect us at the very
least cuz it's just
least cuz it's just
um and we have a rapper anyways it's
um and we have a rapper anyways it's
whatever
we might have to distribute some like
we might have to distribute some like
post install script or whatever
but
man e
I'm in there
it does have warm

that's for
now this should
now this should
be we'll do compute device

so be compute

device
yay not
connected did this
connected did this
run I think it
ran solid
can we get this working without
headless
headless it should just do render right
okay still
failing Graphics device else this is
zero
sea e
all but I'm not doing this I'm rendering
all but I'm not doing this I'm rendering
on my local machine
Docker container does not support
rendering well shoot
really wait we include the appropriate
really wait we include the appropriate
components in the sample Docker
components in the sample Docker
file

oh hang on
oh hang on
they uh they fixed it
maybe uh
Vulcan utils
okay so can I just do this
no Vulcan
utils I fear that this is too old
that's
that's
obnoxious so basically very old
obnoxious so basically very old
container to render
debugging
Vulcan maybe I don't need this
and
then here's your
chair e
any chance that this
renders
renders
oh it works
that's
that's
impressive I got it working in a
Docker very
Docker very
nice and then we
oops copy
this just so I don't lose this
hey man care to explain what you're

looking to get an ml Z your actual

haven't started it properly so
haven't started it properly so
currently I'm working with the uh High
currently I'm working with the uh High
Fidelity physics Sim uh Isaac
gy let me see if there is
gy let me see if there is
where's some
where's some
images so you're not able to follow
images so you're not able to follow
along because I'm just dealing with
along because I'm just dealing with
horrible infrastructure mess at the
horrible infrastructure mess at the
moment um so this is Isaac
moment um so this is Isaac
Jim it's a high performance physics
Jim it's a high performance physics
simulator by Nvidia uh it's kind of old
simulator by Nvidia uh it's kind of old
they've released some new stuff but a
they've released some new stuff but a
lot of people still use this because the
lot of people still use this because the
new stuff has some issues uh so I've
new stuff has some issues uh so I've
been right now I've just been trying to
been right now I've just been trying to
get the renderer working for this but
get the renderer working for this but
generally what's happened with this
generally what's happened with this
library is that three consecutive
library is that three consecutive
generations of PhD students have just
generations of PhD students have just
written wrappers over each other's code
written wrappers over each other's code
so this Sim is really good but the code
so this Sim is really good but the code
to use it is a total nightmare so what
to use it is a total nightmare so what
I've been doing today is I've been
I've been doing today is I've been
stripping down all that code to the bare
stripping down all that code to the bare
minimum trying to get a really simple
minimum trying to get a really simple
nice example uh of this environment up
nice example uh of this environment up
and running and then integrate it with
and running and then integrate it with
puffer lib which is the library I
puffer lib which is the library I
develop for ultra high performance
develop for ultra high performance
reinforcement learning and if I'm able
reinforcement learning and if I'm able
to get all this stuff working this
to get all this stuff working this
basically we'll have this very nice high
basically we'll have this very nice high
performance physics Sim that people like
performance physics Sim that people like
combined with my popular very very high
combined with my popular very very high
performance easy to use reinforcement
performance easy to use reinforcement
learning library so a lot of High
learning library so a lot of High
Fidelity continuous uh control stuff
Fidelity continuous uh control stuff
will get a lot easier that's currently
will get a lot easier that's currently
what I'm working on
okay so this
has I think this this renders now I see
has I think this this renders now I see
I mean it's part of what I stream
for okay so this is the Isaac gy
for okay so this is the Isaac gy
renderer we got the viewer we got the
renderer we got the viewer we got the
Sim we got perf this all works now
Sim we got perf this all works now
there's nothing loaded into it there's
there's nothing loaded into it there's
no scene or anything because it's just
no scene or anything because it's just
the base n but this actually works num
the base n but this actually works num
instances is zero in renderer nothing to
instances is zero in renderer nothing to
do okay so that actually doesn't look
do okay so that actually doesn't look
great um maybe the screen shouldn't be
great um maybe the screen shouldn't be
black maybe there should at least be
black maybe there should at least be
like a background scene
like a background scene
color but hey I got something to run and
color but hey I got something to run and
it ran first try on the code so I think
it ran first try on the code so I think
that that's pretty damn
good as soon as I fixed up all the Isaac
good as soon as I fixed up all the Isaac
Jim errors code ran first try that's
Jim errors code ran first try that's
pretty damn
good so let me see what is this number
instances do you suggest to do a
instances do you suggest to do a
master's and then a PhD n ml um I assume
master's and then a PhD n ml um I assume
that you're not in the US so in the US
that you're not in the US so in the US
you don't do a master's and then do a
you don't do a master's and then do a
PhD you go straight from undergrad into
PhD you go straight from undergrad into
PhD and some PHD programs allow you to
PhD and some PHD programs allow you to
get a master's as part of your PhD
get a master's as part of your PhD
program but typically if you get a
program but typically if you get a
master's in the US then that's like a
master's in the US then that's like a
negative for doing a PhD
negative for doing a PhD
uh I only suggest doing a PhD if you're
uh I only suggest doing a PhD if you're
really sure that you want to do a PhD
really sure that you want to do a PhD
basically so in my case I did a PhD
basically so in my case I did a PhD
because I had a very specific project
because I had a very specific project
that I needed 5 years to fully develop
that I needed 5 years to fully develop
in order to advance a specific area of
in order to advance a specific area of
of Science and I wasn't going to be able
of Science and I wasn't going to be able
to do it in industry and it was way too
to do it in industry and it was way too
premature to do as a startup so that's
premature to do as a startup so that's
why I did a PhD
why I did a PhD
um you pretty much have a very strong
um you pretty much have a very strong
reason for wanting to do a PhD because
reason for wanting to do a PhD because
you know it's 5 years of your life um
you know it's 5 years of your life um
you can do a lot of other things in five
you can do a lot of other things in five
years it's five years with not a ton of
years it's five years with not a ton of
funding and you know having to work
funding and you know having to work
within academic constraints so
within academic constraints so
yeah suggested to Masters Masters is
yeah suggested to Masters Masters is
fine Masters is quick often depending on
fine Masters is quick often depending on
your University you can literally just
your University you can literally just
do a masters as part of your undergrad
do a masters as part of your undergrad
like uh in my undergrad you could just
like uh in my undergrad you could just
get a master's as part of your four-year
get a master's as part of your four-year
degree other pretty credible people have
degree other pretty credible people have
said read a bunch of papers and make
said read a bunch of papers and make
projects and iterate pretty much just
projects and iterate pretty much just
that in fact that's exactly what I
that in fact that's exactly what I
suggest in uh I don't know if you're
suggest in uh I don't know if you're
interested in RL specifically but for my
interested in RL specifically but for my
stuff I've got on both my X and I
stuff I've got on both my X and I
believe do I have it
believe do I have it
here yeah I got the RL quickart guide on
here yeah I got the RL quickart guide on
puffer doai so this is all of my tips on
puffer doai so this is all of my tips on
how to get into reinforcement learning
how to get into reinforcement learning
and I also have this video which is like
and I also have this video which is like
a nice overview of the current landscape
a nice overview of the current landscape
of
RL I want to get into Ai and Healthcare
RL I want to get into Ai and Healthcare
lost okay I didn't see that part yeah it
lost okay I didn't see that part yeah it
depends what branch of AI in healthcare
depends what branch of AI in healthcare
you don't need to do a PhD to be an AI I
you don't need to do a PhD to be an AI I
will say I mean it makes it easier to
will say I mean it makes it easier to
get hired at specific research Labs but
get hired at specific research Labs but
AI is changing so much like it's going
AI is changing so much like it's going
to be a totally different field in 5
to be a totally different field in 5
years you know you're going to be really
years you know you're going to be really
annoyed because the field is going to
annoyed because the field is going to
look completely different in 5 years
look completely different in 5 years
from what you do
from what you do
now why is Masters looked down on it's
now why is Masters looked down on it's
not looked down on in general it's only
not looked down on in general it's only
that like you don't tend to do a masters
that like you don't tend to do a masters
followed by a PhD um because a masters I
followed by a PhD um because a masters I
I guess if you did it integrated in your
I guess if you did it integrated in your
undergrad maybe but they basically
undergrad maybe but they basically
you're they're going to make you do it
you're they're going to make you do it
anyways and it's like 2 years extra or a
anyways and it's like 2 years extra or a
year extra and then you're going to do 5
year extra and then you're going to do 5
years as a PhD it's just too
years as a PhD it's just too
much like you typically you pick one or
much like you typically you pick one or
the other and you do
the other and you do
that that's only in the US uh in Europe
that that's only in the US uh in Europe
I believe that they do their masters in
I believe that they do their masters in
two years or whatever and then they do
two years or whatever and then they do
their PHD in two or three years it's
different in the typically you do your
different in the typically you do your
undergrad you either do straight to PhD
undergrad you either do straight to PhD
or you work for like a maximum of two
or you work for like a maximum of two
years you join a startup you join a big
years you join a startup you join a big
tech company something like that and
tech company something like that and
then you apply and you know within a
then you apply and you know within a
couple years you don't want to wait too
couple years you don't want to wait too
long after undergrad you go back and do
long after undergrad you go back and do
your
your
PhD thank you so much nothing too
PhD thank you so much nothing too
focused on open to really just want a
focused on open to really just want a
better Healthcare through Tech yeah it
better Healthcare through Tech yeah it
very much is if you know if if I weren't
very much is if you know if if I weren't
working on this I probably be working on
working on this I probably be working on
that the main problem with healthcare
that the main problem with healthcare
for me is that there's just so much
for me is that there's just so much
regulation uh it's really hard to do
regulation uh it's really hard to do
anything fast I like to be I like to
anything fast I like to be I like to
work in spaces where I can just solve
work in spaces where I can just solve
stuff overnight super fast if I'm you
stuff overnight super fast if I'm you
know if I'm clever if I'm doing stuff
know if I'm clever if I'm doing stuff
the right way um you know literally just
the right way um you know literally just
the last week I rewrote an hyper pram
the last week I rewrote an hyper pram
algorithm in a day and it's like
algorithm in a day and it's like
completely changed the way that I'm
completely changed the way that I'm
looking at the field now um it's hard
looking at the field now um it's hard
hard to do that type of thing when
hard to do that type of thing when
there's like 5 years of regulatory
there's like 5 years of regulatory
approval Canada's more European I don't
approval Canada's more European I don't
know how it works in
know how it works in
Canada it might be that Canada might
Canada it might be that Canada might
have the European
have the European
model but in the US your phds are five
model but in the US your phds are five
or six years you do them after undergrad
or six years you do them after undergrad
typically some places maybe there's a
typically some places maybe there's a
way to cut off years with a master but
way to cut off years with a master but
like with MIT if you don't get your
like with MIT if you don't get your
masters from MIT they make you redo it
masters from MIT they make you redo it
anyways so it's like do we want a master
anyways so it's like do we want a master
student who's like going to have to redo
student who's like going to have to redo
you know it's like you're kind of
you know it's like you're kind of
wasting your time spinning your wheels
wasting your time spinning your wheels
at that
at that
point it's just it's too
much oh I haven't added environment is
why yeah so this is fine this is obvious
why yeah so this is fine this is obvious
there's nothing to render because I
there's nothing to render because I
haven't set up any environments this is
haven't set up any environments this is
fine only issue with Healthcare it's so
fine only issue with Healthcare it's so
archaic so much work yeah I I really
archaic so much work yeah I I really
don't like spaces that force you to move
don't like spaces that force you to move
slow I get bored when stuff is slow I
slow I get bored when stuff is slow I
get bored and when I get bored I can no
get bored and when I get bored I can no
longer focus on my work and I like lose
longer focus on my work and I like lose
all excitement um
all excitement um
I don't
I don't
know I think like I like I'm interested
know I think like I like I'm interested
in like crazy out there stuff in
in like crazy out there stuff in
healthcare like I don't know can we get
healthcare like I don't know can we get
AI to design Nanobots that like I don't

somehow
okay I mean this test seems to work so
okay I mean this test seems to work so
let's do the other one which I'm sure
let's do the other one which I'm sure
will take much

let's see the order that they call

this okay
so they call this
here cannot be

well you created the N instances
well you created the N instances
here what do you call
Super well this is hold on this is

they're doing

doing so we do do states
tensor okay so we get

what hang on where the [ __ ] where is

happening is it
this get act where the heck
okay hold
on something screwy
okay begin aggregate
right so this dies on create
right so this dies on create
actor because
what let me see what the hell's wrong
what let me see what the hell's wrong
with

here begin aggregate so create and begin

is this completely
different well no it's
different well no it's
not hey how's it
going this is pain and
suffering
um call filter
nid D so these are fine right and
nid D so these are fine right and

then they call create actor

I don't think I'm doing anything that I

it it's what you it's what Unity uses
I've had to write some C it's like
I've had to write some C it's like
moderately less bad I
guess I don't like
it I mean to be fair Unity is not not

well we were reimplementing it in C cuz
well we were reimplementing it in C cuz
the Java version
the Java version
sucks you can't use the it's too first
sucks you can't use the it's too first
of all it's a mess to even get working
of all it's a mess to even get working
second of all it's way too
second of all it's way too
slow so I made a prototype of it and now
slow so I made a prototype of it and now
we have a contributor who's finishing
it that's been a pretty good pattern as
it that's been a pretty good pattern as
I prototype stuff and then I finally

see PD offsets

right okay so they do create
M and then hold on there's a super
M and then hold on there's a super
create Ms that I
create Ms that I
missed isn't
there wait create end
okay this is in create
Sim hold on
see why this code
sucks oh wait wa wait I know I know I
sucks oh wait wa wait I know I know I
know what it is
know what it is
I think I
I think I
know I bet it's
know I bet it's
this I bet this has to go

here where is it called prepare
Sim it's in the
base okay so it calls prepare Sim in the

init so where is
init so where is
where's super in it
here super in it
is
is
huh oh wait wait no because it's the
huh oh wait wait no because it's the
weird thing okay give me one second let
weird thing okay give me one second let
me I just got to finish this thought
so because it calls super
inet and then this
calls so this calls create
Sim and then if I go back here [ __ ]
Sim and then if I go back here [ __ ]
objectoriented programming is a piece of
objectoriented programming is a piece of

[ __ ] and this is why
um this calls okay so super create
um this calls okay so super create
s is
here oh wait no this creates the Sim and
here oh wait no this creates the Sim and
then it creates the
M okay so right after PD
control which
is right there
and I just have to do
and I just have to do
this and

after about 6 months of research I uh
after about 6 months of research I uh
submitted and published my first paper

the HQ I was local to the area and I
the HQ I was local to the area and I
gave a presentation open to uh open to
gave a presentation open to uh open to
the company that was their interview
the company that was their interview
process then I had like three 1hour
process then I had like three 1hour
chats with various researchers had lunch
chats with various researchers had lunch
with with the company and I got an offer

after that and I ended up spending six
after that and I ended up spending six
months there and after that I followed

Philip to MIT because he was going to be
Philip to MIT because he was going to be
a professor there so I followed him
a professor there so I followed him
there for my PhD
oops there we go that was it

now it's not the same company
trolling uh okay yeah
trolling uh okay yeah
here
um there really not anything I can do
um there really not anything I can do
with this
contact
bodies I'll just do this for
now so how are you making money if
now so how are you making money if
everything's open source we're not
everything's open source we're not
making a ton of money yet but we do have
making a ton of money yet but we do have
Revenue I'll show
Revenue I'll show
you and what I'm doing right now is
you and what I'm doing right now is
technically for a
client we sell service
client we sell service
packages so we make these tools uh
packages so we make these tools uh
they're very good they're incredibly
they're very good they're incredibly
fast they're very easy to use we're

reinforcement learning so if you have a

company that has a problem that requires
company that has a problem that requires
reinforcement learning that you're
reinforcement learning that you're
having a tough time with which you
having a tough time with which you
probably are cuz reinforcement learning
probably are cuz reinforcement learning
is hard why wouldn't you want us on your

side right we sell service contracts
side right we sell service contracts
starting at 10K a
starting at 10K a
month which for a decent chunk of my
month which for a decent chunk of my
time is a pretty darn good
time is a pretty darn good
price and it ramps up from there you
price and it ramps up from there you
know I have PhD buddies I can bring in
know I have PhD buddies I can bring in
as contractors for larger projects of
as contractors for larger projects of
this is this being one of them
this is this being one of them
so that's what we do goal is in the next
so that's what we do goal is in the next
several months to scale this so that we
several months to scale this so that we
have five consistent clients which would
have five consistent clients which would
be 50k a month in Revenue which would be
be 50k a month in Revenue which would be
more than enough for us to uh you know
more than enough for us to uh you know
continue funding Hardware
continue funding Hardware
expenses and large bounties and you know
expenses and large bounties and you know
other things around in the community
this is not an amazing business model by
this is not an amazing business model by
any means but it's a viable
any means but it's a viable
one you know this is not as much money
one you know this is not as much money
as I could make doing other stuff
as I could make doing other stuff
but I it's perfectly serviceable and I
but I it's perfectly serviceable and I
think it can scale reasonably well while

also letting me revolutionize the field
how are you
how are you
splitting payments you mean with
splitting payments you mean with
contractors so the base is 10K that
contractors so the base is 10K that
covers my time if they want if they want
covers my time if they want if they want
a contractor puffer charges 10K and the
a contractor puffer charges 10K and the
contractor gets 7.5 which is just about
contractor gets 7.5 which is just about
the best possible rate you will find
the best possible rate you will find
anywhere in
anywhere in
Consulting usually they keep less than
half we charge the client 10K they get
half we charge the client 10K they get
7.5 and that's that's intended to be for
7.5 and that's that's intended to be for

few years right contribute some cool
few years right contribute some cool
stuff in the meantime I want to get once
stuff in the meantime I want to get once
we get a little more Revenue right I'm
we get a little more Revenue right I'm
going to probably start putting up
going to probably start putting up

things like here one of the things that
things like here one of the things that
and also there are other cool things so
and also there are other cool things so
like there's this collab with NYU where
like there's this collab with NYU where
probably in the next couple weeks we're
probably in the next couple weeks we're
going to need somebody to uh contribute
going to need somebody to uh contribute

so of puffer we made thousand times
so of puffer we made thousand times
faster environments in training so we
faster environments in training so we
can run so many more experiments than

hyperparameter sweep Integrations lots

of things to make training nice and easy
of things to make training nice and easy
in the next phase we're going to take
in the next phase we're going to take
that we're going to do more science side
that we're going to do more science side
work in order to make the algorithms and
work in order to make the algorithms and
training much more stable and therefore
training much more stable and therefore
easier to get working on new problems

hoct all right so we got to figure this
hoct all right so we got to figure this
stupid Hoy [ __ ] out I guess
well the good news is that this is
um this is motion file data
but I think in the meantime if I just

comment
it right
I can literally just do

how do your eyes handle the

non-contrasted code theme what do you
mean it is plenty

extendable and modu
modular thing is a lie is because you
modular thing is a lie is because you
never know what ways to make it
never know what ways to make it
extendable in modular up front so you'll

always be wrong so you'll overbuild the

prevent you from actually building it in

works very very easily it's actually

incredibly easy for me to build stuff on
incredibly easy for me to build stuff on
top of what I have because I just have
top of what I have because I just have
five times less code than you is
five times less code than you is
basically the idea if I have five times
basically the idea if I have five times
less code then you it really doesn't
less code then you it really doesn't
matter what your code looks like it's
matter what your code looks like it's
still easier for me to add stuff and
still easier for me to add stuff and
change stuff
change stuff
around I just have less code to deal
with I can't create empty temps are
with I can't create empty temps are
lovely

they'd have a 300 L like a 300,000 line
they'd have a 300 L like a 300,000 line
project somehow right so they'd
project somehow right so they'd
basically turn the medium project into a
basically turn the medium project into a
large project and they'd say oh it's so
large project and they'd say oh it's so
hard and so complicated we have so much
hard and so complicated we have so much
code yeah you have so much code because

you wrote it
wrong just don't abstract abstraction is
wrong just don't abstract abstraction is
bad stop it I mean seriously give it a

try do it less see if you have a easier
try do it less see if you have a easier
time try it a bit look at some of a code
time try it a bit look at some of a code
as well I mean this isn't my code this

hard you really don't need to overthink

it it's a it's really it's a noob trap
it it's a it's really it's a noob trap
is what it
is what's this can't create empty tensor
is what's this can't create empty tensor
how do I find where this thing
is it really is a noob trap I'm telling
is it really is a noob trap I'm telling
you
doesn't matter I just want to see the

robots in the scene dude so all I want
robots in the scene dude so all I want
to do is I want to see the robots in the

dude don't plan for the next 10 years
dude don't plan for the next 10 years
you're going to be
wrong you're always going to be wrong so
wrong you're always going to be wrong so
stop trying to plan for it write less
stop trying to plan for it write less
code and then it'll be easier for you to
code and then it'll be easier for you to
fix it when you need to fix
it yeah you've been lied to I hate to
it yeah you've been lied to I hate to
tell you like object-oriented
tell you like object-oriented
programming is like this weird brain
programming is like this weird brain
worm that infects everyone it's like as
worm that infects everyone it's like as
soon as you program not in that way you
soon as you program not in that way you
see oh holy hell there's a whole other
see oh holy hell there's a whole other
way that you can write code that's way

easier
try this bres some
tensors can't create empty tensor
still yeah I saw a robot I want the

robot to be there
consistently wait can't create empty

it's in

somewhere okay there are a couple places
somewhere okay there are a couple places
yes there are a couple places where you
yes there are a couple places where you
need to have some sort of objectoriented
need to have some sort of objectoriented
like thing uh usually you want it for

dynamic dispatch it's like if you're
dynamic dispatch it's like if you're
looping over many things of different
looping over many things of different

specific behavior but the same thing
there are cases where you want that but
there are cases where you want that but
the thing is it's vastly overused it

very shitty
this can't create empty tensor driving
this can't create empty tensor driving
me
me
nuts I'm just literally going to do this
nuts I'm just literally going to do this
and see when it makes an empty
tensor you don't need these things most
tensor you don't need these things most
of the time because these are things
of the time because these are things
that are bolted on objectoriented
that are bolted on objectoriented
programming you make it less
bad heck what's wrong with this
oh
oh
what I meant to do great point I don't
what I meant to do great point I don't
know how that I typed the totally wrong
thing
e e
no I don't
no I don't
um mostly
procedural there's no
Paradigm it's mostly data and
functions it's not functional that's
functions it's not functional that's
another Dogma that's just as
bad I mean procedural is just like you
bad I mean procedural is just like you
write your code simple that's it you
write your code simple that's it you
don't like you don't have any fancy
don't like you don't have any fancy
ideas that you're trying to
ideas that you're trying to
impose just write your simple
code stay away from functional
code stay away from functional

that like fault is weird
the seg fault is very
weird oh it's probably because the

action space sample
huh yeah I bet it's because of that hold
huh yeah I bet it's because of that hold

really I guess the action space must be

actually
what
now 153 okay that is actually
correct that is actually
correct what if I do
what if I comment the
what if I comment the
actions can I do

that I just want this to run
stably it's still seg

cuz like there's the robot it disappears
cuz like there's the robot it disappears
and then it crashes
does it crash after one step or is there
does it crash after one step or is there
like a horizon that I'm
missing let's see one 2
missing let's see one 2

like dude you should get sleep just go
like dude you should get sleep just go
to sleep now now it's incredibly
important like I'm going to get eight

it's like you can write passable

this thing doesn't

work I mean like pie torch is fine pie
torch is like object oriented API is
torch is like object oriented API is
fine right that's a good example of

something that's like fine
right because it's very horizontal right

it doesn't go
it doesn't go
deep right it's just a bunch of

it's very horizontal there just a bunch
it's very horizontal there just a bunch
of modules that all have the same API

that's
that's
fine as soon as you start going
deep and a lot of the time the
deep and a lot of the time the
horizontal doesn't even need to be
horizontal not
horizontal not
necessarily it depends who you talk to
man oh look at all the Bots I see
man oh look at all the Bots I see
multiple
multiple
Bots
Bots
okay and then you
okay and then you
simulate on the second render step you
fail why do you fail on the second
fail why do you fail on the second
render step is that a thing
the Bots are
gone and then it's say
gone and then it's say
fults okay so something's going very
fults okay so something's going very
wrong
wrong
here um I think if I do hold
on if I do this
SW is the
SW is the

friender well yeah but you're Court like
friender well yeah but you're Court like
you shouldn't pay too much attention to
you shouldn't pay too much attention to

that and honestly they really don't you
take like
take like
um I think the very first intro course
um I think the very first intro course
is in Java and then after that
is in Java and then after that
gone all your system courses won't
gone all your system courses won't
be okay that's interesting you don't
be okay that's interesting you don't
even have to run simulate and it's still
even have to run simulate and it's still
uh it still
fails they're all the robots
H now it's failing on the

huh surely you can't
psych yeah there you go so this thing

does not seg fault now
right oh [ __ ] maybe it
does let

let's see if these uh these
work we'll get rid of all the ones of
work we'll get rid of all the ones of
these that we don't
these that we don't
need oh my
gosh so much garbage in here
okay and now we have to do torch
and there should be a two torch in
here why is there no two torch in
here did kung add this
it's right here did I just miss it where
it's right here did I just miss it where
did K add

there's more [ __ ] in

freaking like what the hell is this
I mean they just have too much code like
I mean they just have too much code like
this is a ridiculous reward function
this is a ridiculous reward function
what is
this let's see what's still missing in
this let's see what's still missing in
here yeah this one

okay
TCH is hoi and then I guess this make
TCH is hoi and then I guess this make
function this make function gets much
function this make function gets much
easier now because we just do like this
literally don't need any of this
freaking crazy
oops oh that's the wrong one it's
it is this
one okay
good we're getting somewhere
th000
th000
lines we'll be able to cut some of
lines we'll be able to cut some of
this for reference the original is over
this for reference the original is over
2,000
so we've uh We've cut the code down a
so we've uh We've cut the code down a
lot still have a little more to go
but for
it should just be
um render right or something
I got to go back into the freaking the
I got to go back into the freaking the
base class
again okay it's viewers none so this is
again okay it's viewers none so this is
m. viewer
uh right here yes n so it's going to be
uh right here yes n so it's going to be
n
viewer and why is n not here there
viewer and why is n not here there
should
be M up viewer
we'll just do self view or S and
viewer get access
pams let's just
just looking for
yellow do we have after root state
um looking for
yellow okay at least
yellow okay at least
everything outside self is defined
we're going to have to test this a
we're going to have to test this a
bunch let's commit it first
okay so we're going to
make for
and now I got to grab these annoying
pams I
pams I
mean can I not just do
wait what
where I could just make them
where I could just make them
default it irritates me a little bit to
default it irritates me a little bit to
duplicate but
duplicate but
like control headless

again we do was it
headless step
n no module
oh yeah JY torch is an Isaac Puck we got
oh yeah JY torch is an Isaac Puck we got
to figure that
out R
tensor okay all I need is wrap tensor
tensor okay all I need is wrap tensor
and unwrap tensor from this
dude how is
dude how is
this RP tenser
rap tensor
has yeah
[ __ ] C++ build is really obnoxious
you know wait a
second there should be something built
second there should be something built
into Isaac for this right did these just
into Isaac for this right did these just
got did these guys just write their own
got did these guys just write their own
dumb thing for no
dumb thing for no
reason hang on
I'm pretty sure the tensor API
hey how's it
going currently trying to make Isaac Jim
going currently trying to make Isaac Jim
work without being
work without being
ridiculous okay this is not Isaac Jim is
ridiculous okay this is not Isaac Jim is
not
not
here this is an external
tensor API
maybe wait gym torch wrap
tensor using the provided gym torch
tensor using the provided gym torch
interop module
so this should be an Isaac gy
right why is it outside of Isaac
gy wait there it is it's in gym torch
wrap tensor yeah it's right

enough that like you know we've actually
got a pretty solid proposition for
companies look like I I own like a small
companies look like I I own like a small
number of ETFs with some Bitcoin and
number of ETFs with some Bitcoin and
stuff but that's about as much as I do
stuff but that's about as much as I do
and that's like a very small part
that sounds up my alley can you give me
that sounds up my alley can you give me
a quick rundown it's a GPU Accel

Madrona which is uh a GPU engine
Madrona which is uh a GPU engine
basically a GPU accelerated game engine

that handles some of the physics and
that handles some of the physics and
stuff so the idea would either to be

Port it to use either box 2D or
Port it to use either box 2D or
depending on how simple the physics is
depending on how simple the physics is
maybe just our own
maybe just our own
stuff um so we have to replace some of
stuff um so we have to replace some of
the physics from adona but other than
the physics from adona but other than
that like their source is only a couple
that like their source is only a couple
thousand lines I don't think it would be
thousand lines I don't think it would be
any longer in C I think it would be way
any longer in C I think it would be way
faster because they handle like variable
faster because they handle like variable
numbers of cars and stuff with fix size
numbers of cars and stuff with fix size
tensors with very low density which is
tensors with very low density which is
really bad for them um yeah bunch of
stuff I mean I only really have a small
stuff I mean I only really have a small
amount of Bitcoin it's like I don't know
amount of Bitcoin it's like I don't know
it's for me it's not as interesting I'd
it's for me it's not as interesting I'd
rather have like Nvidia and Tesla you
rather have like Nvidia and Tesla you
know companies that I care about that I
know companies that I care about that I
think are doing good work and that I
think are doing good work and that I
think are you know going to
think are you know going to
appreciate because they're doing good

work I also have you know

diversification stuff but I don't do
diversification stuff but I don't do
very much I don't day trade I just I
very much I don't day trade I just I
don't even look at them right I just
don't even look at them right I just
have some stocks and I just leave them
have some stocks and I just leave them
there for
years I really don't think about them
years I really don't think about them
much
I'm more interested at the moment in
I'm more interested at the moment in
figuring out how to get recurring

been supporting them for a while now and

it's just like we've gotten to a point
it's just like we've gotten to a point
where I've optimized the heck out of

these are two very different things like

yeah we've got 500k in Revenue because
yeah we've got 500k in Revenue because
it's like you know sitting in an ETF
it's like you know sitting in an ETF

I started I feel I'm at the top of the
I started I feel I'm at the top of the
world but after some time I
stop I don't know quite know what you
stop I don't know quite know what you
mean by
that
that
original holy that's ridiculous
dude why why do they do
dude why why do they do
this what
this what
like they put the original Isaac JY
like they put the original Isaac JY
inside of Isaac JY including the
inside of Isaac JY including the
freaking source file that we
need Okay um
need Okay um
is this enough or do I have to re I
is this enough or do I have to re I
might have to recompile I don't know it
might have to recompile I don't know it
depends it might Hot
Load okay I do have to
I do have to recompile this hold hold

okay oh
wait Isaac
wait Isaac

be hang on
yeah so we do this
okay so it's not getting copied
okay so it's not getting copied
over but
Yik my
Go hip install oh

do install dot doesn't work with Dash e
do install dot doesn't work with Dash e
for some reason yeah there we go now
for some reason yeah there we go now
it's building the
wheel and then this should work
we're going to have to package this
we're going to have to package this
thing up in a container like it is such
thing up in a container like it is such
a
pain still no

now it has underscore bindings but it
now it has underscore bindings but it
doesn't
doesn't
have still doesn't have

weird um
collect files Isaac Jim

oh is that
it
where numpy has no attribute float
does this specify a

1.6.4
e I have no idea what happens if we try
e I have no idea what happens if we try
to install numpy
1.20 or
1.20 or
1.16 we'll see if puffer lib still

expand puffer into High Fidelity physics

shoot me a follow see you around thanks
shoot me a follow see you around thanks
for dropping

distribute it with puff like you have to

actually wait yeah yeah yeah we can

stick it on a container for them we'll
stick it on a container for them we'll
probably will put it on our main
probably will put it on our main

where did I get this numb inner
where did I get this numb inner
iterations from where I got it from

installing well this is why we'd put it
installing well this is why we'd put it

so like regardless of whether we put gym

fix it and I ISAC in fact I fixed it in
fix it and I ISAC in fact I fixed it in
Isaac with one line I don't know if you
Isaac with one line I don't know if you
saw
um all I did
was I just
was I just
added uh the source files right here so
added uh the source files right here so
it actually moves the source files to
it actually moves the source files to
the correct spot that's all so we can

totally just like have a version of this
totally just like have a version of this
we distribute that's just already
we distribute that's just already
pre-installed on the docker container
pre-installed on the docker container
right and then we'll just hand the

client the docker container people can
client the docker container people can
use it through Docker or if they want to
use it through Docker or if they want to
install our version separately they can
install our version separately they can
do that as
well wait what the heck
they just had the license on
they just had the license on
uh where the hell is the
license Omni verse Isaac

was Isaac lab is open

uh whatever it's like three minor
uh whatever it's like three minor
changes if we have to distribute a like
changes if we have to distribute a like
a PO install script or whatever we will
let me double check
let me double check
this they open sourced it but then they
this they open sourced it but then they
have a weird license
Isaac Jim
python
Nvidia but they open source the thing
Nvidia but they open source the thing
how can they they release the code but
how can they they release the code but
say you can't use it
say you can't use it
how does that make any sense
the heck is the license like this
the heck is the license like this
doesn't make
sense is it Omniverse is that different
we kind of got to figure this out
open source
I don't understand the
license e
this seems like something we have to
this seems like something we have to
bring up
right e
did I get
did I get

off
okay
um I'll keep on this for a bit I this is

we're this doesn't affect us at the very
we're this doesn't affect us at the very
least cuz it's just

okay still
failing Graphics device else this is

all but I'm not doing this I'm rendering

no Vulcan

that's
that's
obnoxious so basically very old
obnoxious so basically very old

debugging
Vulcan maybe I don't need this
and
then here's your

any chance that this

oh it works
that's

where's some
where's some
images so you're not able to follow
images so you're not able to follow
along because I'm just dealing with
along because I'm just dealing with
horrible infrastructure mess at the
horrible infrastructure mess at the
moment um so this is Isaac
moment um so this is Isaac
Jim it's a high performance physics
Jim it's a high performance physics
simulator by Nvidia uh it's kind of old
simulator by Nvidia uh it's kind of old
they've released some new stuff but a
they've released some new stuff but a
lot of people still use this because the
lot of people still use this because the
new stuff has some issues uh so I've
new stuff has some issues uh so I've
been right now I've just been trying to
been right now I've just been trying to
get the renderer working for this but
get the renderer working for this but
generally what's happened with this
generally what's happened with this
library is that three consecutive
library is that three consecutive
generations of PhD students have just
generations of PhD students have just
written wrappers over each other's code
written wrappers over each other's code
so this Sim is really good but the code
so this Sim is really good but the code
to use it is a total nightmare so what
to use it is a total nightmare so what
I've been doing today is I've been
I've been doing today is I've been
stripping down all that code to the bare
stripping down all that code to the bare
minimum trying to get a really simple
minimum trying to get a really simple
nice example uh of this environment up
nice example uh of this environment up
and running and then integrate it with
and running and then integrate it with
puffer lib which is the library I
puffer lib which is the library I
develop for ultra high performance
develop for ultra high performance
reinforcement learning and if I'm able
reinforcement learning and if I'm able
to get all this stuff working this
to get all this stuff working this
basically we'll have this very nice high
basically we'll have this very nice high
performance physics Sim that people like
performance physics Sim that people like
combined with my popular very very high
combined with my popular very very high
performance easy to use reinforcement
performance easy to use reinforcement
learning library so a lot of High
learning library so a lot of High
Fidelity continuous uh control stuff
Fidelity continuous uh control stuff
will get a lot easier that's currently
will get a lot easier that's currently
what I'm working on
okay so this
has I think this this renders now I see
has I think this this renders now I see
I mean it's part of what I stream
for okay so this is the Isaac gy
for okay so this is the Isaac gy
renderer we got the viewer we got the
renderer we got the viewer we got the
Sim we got perf this all works now
Sim we got perf this all works now
there's nothing loaded into it there's
there's nothing loaded into it there's
no scene or anything because it's just
no scene or anything because it's just
the base n but this actually works num
the base n but this actually works num
instances is zero in renderer nothing to
instances is zero in renderer nothing to
do okay so that actually doesn't look
do okay so that actually doesn't look
great um maybe the screen shouldn't be
great um maybe the screen shouldn't be
black maybe there should at least be
black maybe there should at least be
like a background scene
like a background scene
color but hey I got something to run and
color but hey I got something to run and
it ran first try on the code so I think
it ran first try on the code so I think
that that's pretty damn
good as soon as I fixed up all the Isaac
good as soon as I fixed up all the Isaac
Jim errors code ran first try that's
Jim errors code ran first try that's
pretty damn
good so let me see what is this number
instances do you suggest to do a
instances do you suggest to do a
master's and then a PhD n ml um I assume
master's and then a PhD n ml um I assume
that you're not in the US so in the US
that you're not in the US so in the US
you don't do a master's and then do a
you don't do a master's and then do a
PhD you go straight from undergrad into
PhD you go straight from undergrad into
PhD and some PHD programs allow you to
PhD and some PHD programs allow you to
get a master's as part of your PhD
get a master's as part of your PhD
program but typically if you get a
program but typically if you get a
master's in the US then that's like a
master's in the US then that's like a
negative for doing a PhD
negative for doing a PhD
uh I only suggest doing a PhD if you're
uh I only suggest doing a PhD if you're
really sure that you want to do a PhD
really sure that you want to do a PhD
basically so in my case I did a PhD
basically so in my case I did a PhD
because I had a very specific project
because I had a very specific project
that I needed 5 years to fully develop
that I needed 5 years to fully develop
in order to advance a specific area of
in order to advance a specific area of
of Science and I wasn't going to be able
of Science and I wasn't going to be able
to do it in industry and it was way too
to do it in industry and it was way too
premature to do as a startup so that's
premature to do as a startup so that's
why I did a PhD
why I did a PhD
um you pretty much have a very strong
um you pretty much have a very strong
reason for wanting to do a PhD because
reason for wanting to do a PhD because
you know it's 5 years of your life um
you know it's 5 years of your life um
you can do a lot of other things in five
you can do a lot of other things in five
years it's five years with not a ton of
years it's five years with not a ton of
funding and you know having to work
funding and you know having to work
within academic constraints so
within academic constraints so
yeah suggested to Masters Masters is
yeah suggested to Masters Masters is
fine Masters is quick often depending on
fine Masters is quick often depending on
your University you can literally just
your University you can literally just
do a masters as part of your undergrad
do a masters as part of your undergrad
like uh in my undergrad you could just
like uh in my undergrad you could just
get a master's as part of your four-year
get a master's as part of your four-year
degree other pretty credible people have
degree other pretty credible people have
said read a bunch of papers and make
said read a bunch of papers and make
projects and iterate pretty much just
projects and iterate pretty much just
that in fact that's exactly what I
that in fact that's exactly what I
suggest in uh I don't know if you're
suggest in uh I don't know if you're
interested in RL specifically but for my
interested in RL specifically but for my
stuff I've got on both my X and I
stuff I've got on both my X and I
believe do I have it
believe do I have it
here yeah I got the RL quickart guide on
here yeah I got the RL quickart guide on
puffer doai so this is all of my tips on
puffer doai so this is all of my tips on
how to get into reinforcement learning
how to get into reinforcement learning
and I also have this video which is like
and I also have this video which is like
a nice overview of the current landscape
a nice overview of the current landscape
of
RL I want to get into Ai and Healthcare
RL I want to get into Ai and Healthcare
lost okay I didn't see that part yeah it
lost okay I didn't see that part yeah it
depends what branch of AI in healthcare
depends what branch of AI in healthcare
you don't need to do a PhD to be an AI I
you don't need to do a PhD to be an AI I
will say I mean it makes it easier to
will say I mean it makes it easier to
get hired at specific research Labs but
get hired at specific research Labs but
AI is changing so much like it's going
AI is changing so much like it's going
to be a totally different field in 5
to be a totally different field in 5
years you know you're going to be really
years you know you're going to be really
annoyed because the field is going to
annoyed because the field is going to
look completely different in 5 years
look completely different in 5 years
from what you do
from what you do
now why is Masters looked down on it's
now why is Masters looked down on it's
not looked down on in general it's only
not looked down on in general it's only
that like you don't tend to do a masters
that like you don't tend to do a masters
followed by a PhD um because a masters I
followed by a PhD um because a masters I
I guess if you did it integrated in your
I guess if you did it integrated in your
undergrad maybe but they basically
undergrad maybe but they basically
you're they're going to make you do it
you're they're going to make you do it
anyways and it's like 2 years extra or a
anyways and it's like 2 years extra or a
year extra and then you're going to do 5
year extra and then you're going to do 5
years as a PhD it's just too
years as a PhD it's just too
much like you typically you pick one or
much like you typically you pick one or
the other and you do
the other and you do
that that's only in the US uh in Europe
that that's only in the US uh in Europe
I believe that they do their masters in
I believe that they do their masters in
two years or whatever and then they do
two years or whatever and then they do
their PHD in two or three years it's
different in the typically you do your
different in the typically you do your
undergrad you either do straight to PhD
undergrad you either do straight to PhD
or you work for like a maximum of two
or you work for like a maximum of two
years you join a startup you join a big
years you join a startup you join a big
tech company something like that and
tech company something like that and
then you apply and you know within a
then you apply and you know within a
couple years you don't want to wait too
couple years you don't want to wait too
long after undergrad you go back and do
long after undergrad you go back and do
your
your
PhD thank you so much nothing too
PhD thank you so much nothing too
focused on open to really just want a
focused on open to really just want a
better Healthcare through Tech yeah it
better Healthcare through Tech yeah it
very much is if you know if if I weren't
very much is if you know if if I weren't
working on this I probably be working on
working on this I probably be working on
that the main problem with healthcare
that the main problem with healthcare
for me is that there's just so much
for me is that there's just so much
regulation uh it's really hard to do
regulation uh it's really hard to do
anything fast I like to be I like to

work in spaces where I can just solve
work in spaces where I can just solve
stuff overnight super fast if I'm you
stuff overnight super fast if I'm you
know if I'm clever if I'm doing stuff
know if I'm clever if I'm doing stuff
the right way um you know literally just
the right way um you know literally just
the last week I rewrote an hyper pram
the last week I rewrote an hyper pram
algorithm in a day and it's like
algorithm in a day and it's like
completely changed the way that I'm
completely changed the way that I'm
looking at the field now um it's hard
looking at the field now um it's hard
hard to do that type of thing when
hard to do that type of thing when
there's like 5 years of regulatory
there's like 5 years of regulatory
approval Canada's more European I don't

or six years you do them after undergrad

typically some places maybe there's a
typically some places maybe there's a
way to cut off years with a master but
way to cut off years with a master but
like with MIT if you don't get your
like with MIT if you don't get your
masters from MIT they make you redo it
masters from MIT they make you redo it
anyways so it's like do we want a master
anyways so it's like do we want a master
student who's like going to have to redo

you know it's like you're kind of
you know it's like you're kind of
wasting your time spinning your wheels
wasting your time spinning your wheels
at that
at that

there's nothing to render because I
there's nothing to render because I
haven't set up any environments this is
haven't set up any environments this is
fine only issue with Healthcare it's so

weird thing okay give me one second let

here
um there really not anything I can do
um there really not anything I can do
with this

now so how are you making money if
now so how are you making money if
everything's open source we're not
everything's open source we're not
making a ton of money yet but we do have
making a ton of money yet but we do have
Revenue I'll show
Revenue I'll show
you and what I'm doing right now is

technically for a

they're very good they're incredibly

having a tough time with which you
having a tough time with which you
probably are cuz reinforcement learning

starting at 10K a

know I have PhD buddies I can bring in
know I have PhD buddies I can bring in
as contractors for larger projects of
as contractors for larger projects of
this is this being one of them
this is this being one of them
so that's what we do goal is in the next
so that's what we do goal is in the next
several months to scale this so that we
several months to scale this so that we
have five consistent clients which would
have five consistent clients which would
be 50k a month in Revenue which would be
be 50k a month in Revenue which would be
more than enough for us to uh you know
more than enough for us to uh you know
continue funding Hardware

other things around in the community
this is not an amazing business model by

any means but it's a viable
any means but it's a viable
one you know this is not as much money
one you know this is not as much money
as I could make doing other stuff
as I could make doing other stuff
but I it's perfectly serviceable and I
but I it's perfectly serviceable and I
think it can scale reasonably well while
think it can scale reasonably well while
also letting me revolutionize the field
how are you
how are you
splitting payments you mean with
splitting payments you mean with
contractors so the base is 10K that
contractors so the base is 10K that
covers my time if they want if they want
covers my time if they want if they want
a contractor puffer charges 10K and the
a contractor puffer charges 10K and the
contractor gets 7.5 which is just about
contractor gets 7.5 which is just about
the best possible rate you will find
the best possible rate you will find
anywhere in
anywhere in
Consulting usually they keep less than
half we charge the client 10K they get
half we charge the client 10K they get
7.5 and that's that's intended to be for
7.5 and that's that's intended to be for
quarter time work so 10 hours a

only take you about 10 hours a week if
only take you about 10 hours a week if
it takes you longer it takes you longer

hey I'm sure you'll be good in uh in a

few years right contribute some cool
few years right contribute some cool
stuff in the meantime I want to get once
stuff in the meantime I want to get once
we get a little more Revenue right I'm
we get a little more Revenue right I'm
going to probably start putting up
going to probably start putting up
bounties on various
things like here one of the things that
things like here one of the things that
and also there are other cool things so
and also there are other cool things so
like there's this collab with NYU where
like there's this collab with NYU where
probably in the next couple weeks we're
probably in the next couple weeks we're
going to need somebody to uh contribute
going to need somebody to uh contribute
a major piece of C
a major piece of C

working on a new
working on a new
problem so in the first like 8 months or
problem so in the first like 8 months or
so of puffer we made thousand times
so of puffer we made thousand times
faster environments in training so we
faster environments in training so we
can run so many more experiments than
can run so many more experiments than
ever before and we made a nice stable
ever before and we made a nice stable
training system for that good
training system for that good
hyperparameter sweep Integrations lots
hyperparameter sweep Integrations lots
of things to make training nice and easy
of things to make training nice and easy
in the next phase we're going to take
in the next phase we're going to take
that we're going to do more science side
that we're going to do more science side
work in order to make the algorithms and
work in order to make the algorithms and
training much more stable and therefore
training much more stable and therefore
easier to get working on new problems

there's still some ideas I have left I
there's still some ideas I have left I

observations I can just do
observations I can just do
this and then
I'm just do this for
I'm just do this for
now and figure the task stuff out
later
later
boy do I care about
boy do I care about
this I don't know what this
this I don't know what this
is we don't need this OBS buffer either
I don't think we need any of this [ __ ]
I don't think we need any of this [ __ ]
honestly any of this at
all overheard at Stanford I heard I
all overheard at Stanford I heard I
heard a girl one time say like I don't
heard a girl one time say like I don't
know my program I just changed the while
know my program I just changed the while
loop to an if statement and then it
loop to an if statement and then it
worked
that's
that's
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
[Music]
Stamford nope
Stamford nope
[Music]
that was honestly one of the most
that was honestly one of the most
disappointing things to me is you know
disappointing things to me is you know
you work so hard to get to the college
you work so hard to get to the college
and it's like well the top 10% are
and it's like well the top 10% are
pretty
pretty
good so are you kidding
me I got like 10% of these people to
me I got like 10% of these people to
talk to and most of them are shut in
talk to and most of them are shut in
that never leave their room really
you got to be [ __ ]
me again you can learn that [ __ ] it's
me again you can learn that [ __ ] it's
not hard
you can learn I mean you can still learn
you can learn I mean you can still learn
this stuff it just requires being very
this stuff it just requires being very
uncomfortable for a bit
all right where the [ __ ] does this thing
all right where the [ __ ] does this thing
come
from
equals
hoct all right so we got to figure this
hoct all right so we got to figure this
stupid Hoy [ __ ] out I guess
well the good news is that this is
um this is motion file data
but I think in the meantime if I just
but I think in the meantime if I just
comment
it right
I can literally just do
this
what this is what
what this is what
sleep no I get a lot of sleep I've been
sleep no I get a lot of sleep I've been
coding for a while but I get eight or
coding for a while but I get eight or
nine hours of sleep and I'm going to get
nine hours of sleep and I'm going to get
eight or nine hours of sleep mainly back
eight or nine hours of sleep mainly back
in Engineers of course Bunch mumbo
in Engineers of course Bunch mumbo
jumbo is this spe extendable and modular
jumbo is this spe extendable and modular
yeah that's
wrong that's like the biggest lie they
wrong that's like the biggest lie they
tell you
how do your eyes handle the
how do your eyes handle the
non-contrasted code theme what do you
non-contrasted code theme what do you
mean it is plenty
contrasted the reason that the
contrasted the reason that the
extendable and modu
extendable and modu
modular thing is a lie is because you
modular thing is a lie is because you
never know what ways to make it
never know what ways to make it
extendable in modular up front so you'll
extendable in modular up front so you'll
always be wrong so you'll overbuild the
always be wrong so you'll overbuild the
thing every single time which will
thing every single time which will
prevent you from actually building it in
prevent you from actually building it in
the way that that you need to once you
the way that that you need to once you
figure that out you always just do it in
figure that out you always just do it in
the simplest damn way possible and go
the simplest damn way possible and go
from there and half the time the
from there and half the time the
simplest thing just
works very very easily it's actually
works very very easily it's actually
incredibly easy for me to build stuff on
incredibly easy for me to build stuff on
top of what I have because I just have
top of what I have because I just have
five times less code than you is
five times less code than you is
basically the idea if I have five times
basically the idea if I have five times
less code then you it really doesn't
less code then you it really doesn't
matter what your code looks like it's
matter what your code looks like it's
still easier for me to add stuff and
still easier for me to add stuff and
change stuff
change stuff
around I just have less code to deal
with I can't create empty temps are
with I can't create empty temps are
lovely
oops oh I did that intentionally so I
oops oh I did that intentionally so I
don't use it very
much I did that intentionally so I don't
much I did that intentionally so I don't
use it very much
[Laughter]
we're a huge [ __ ] code B
we're a huge [ __ ] code B
right well it depends I specializing
right well it depends I specializing
mediumsized stuff but the thing is
mediumsized stuff but the thing is
like I might have a 20,000 line project
like I might have a 20,000 line project
but I guarantee you if you gave puffer
but I guarantee you if you gave puffer
lib to some Fang Engineers to build
lib to some Fang Engineers to build
they'd have a 300 L like a 300,000 line
they'd have a 300 L like a 300,000 line
project somehow right so they'd
project somehow right so they'd
basically turn the medium project into a
basically turn the medium project into a
large project and they'd say oh it's so
large project and they'd say oh it's so
hard and so complicated we have so much
hard and so complicated we have so much
code yeah you have so much code because
code yeah you have so much code because
you wrote it
wrong just don't abstract abstraction is
wrong just don't abstract abstraction is
bad stop it I mean seriously give it a
bad stop it I mean seriously give it a
try do it less see if you have a easier
try do it less see if you have a easier
time try it a bit look at some of a code
time try it a bit look at some of a code
as well I mean this isn't my code this
as well I mean this isn't my code this
is me refactoring
is me refactoring
garbage like if you want to see my
garbage like if you want to see my
actual code okay let me show you
actual code okay let me show you

don't plan for stuff that you know is

the requirement is we need to support
the requirement is we need to support
these three processors then build for

like you probably literally just if
payment one if payment two if payment
payment one if payment two if payment
three it's not that
hard you really don't need to overthink
hard you really don't need to overthink
it it's a it's really it's a noob trap
it it's a it's really it's a noob trap
is what it
is what's this can't create empty tensor
is what's this can't create empty tensor
how do I find where this thing
is it really is a noob trap I'm telling
is it really is a noob trap I'm telling
you
doesn't matter I just want to see the
doesn't matter I just want to see the
robots in the scene dude so all I want
robots in the scene dude so all I want
to do is I want to see the robots in the
to do is I want to see the robots in the
scene can't create empty tensor
okay I don't call oh I forgot to call
okay I don't call oh I forgot to call
reset hold
reset hold
on but this is probably going to break
on but this is probably going to break
some [ __ ]
dude don't plan for the next 10 years
dude don't plan for the next 10 years
you're going to be
wrong you're always going to be wrong so
wrong you're always going to be wrong so
stop trying to plan for it write less
stop trying to plan for it write less
code and then it'll be easier for you to
code and then it'll be easier for you to
fix it when you need to fix
it yeah you've been lied to I hate to
it yeah you've been lied to I hate to
tell you like object-oriented
tell you like object-oriented
programming is like this weird brain
programming is like this weird brain
worm that infects everyone it's like as
worm that infects everyone it's like as
soon as you program not in that way you
soon as you program not in that way you
see oh holy hell there's a whole other
see oh holy hell there's a whole other
way that you can write code that's way
way that you can write code that's way
easier
try this bres some
tensors can't create empty tensor
still yeah I saw a robot I want the
still yeah I saw a robot I want the
robot to be there
consistently wait can't create empty
consistently wait can't create empty
tensor is already called hold on
tensor is already called hold on
it's in
it's in
um it's in reset
somewhere okay there are a couple places
somewhere okay there are a couple places
yes there are a couple places where you
yes there are a couple places where you
need to have some sort of objectoriented
need to have some sort of objectoriented
like thing uh usually you want it for
like thing uh usually you want it for
dynamic dispatch it's like if you're
dynamic dispatch it's like if you're
looping over many things of different
looping over many things of different
types and they all need to have the same
types and they all need to have the same
behavior or they all need to have a
behavior or they all need to have a
specific behavior but the same thing
specific behavior but the same thing
there are cases where you want that but
there are cases where you want that but
the thing is it's vastly overused it
the thing is it's vastly overused it
should not it should be a tool for a

Paradigm when you treat it as one it's

very shitty
this can't create empty tensor driving
this can't create empty tensor driving
me
me
nuts I'm just literally going to do this
nuts I'm just literally going to do this
and see when it makes an empty
tensor you don't need these things most
tensor you don't need these things most
of the time because these are things
of the time because these are things
that are bolted on objectoriented
that are bolted on objectoriented
programming you make it less
bad heck what's wrong with this
oh
oh
what I meant to do great point I don't
what I meant to do great point I don't
know how that I typed the totally wrong
thing
e e
no I don't
no I don't
um mostly
procedural there's no
Paradigm it's mostly data and
functions it's not functional that's
functions it's not functional that's
another Dogma that's just as
bad I mean procedural is just like you
bad I mean procedural is just like you
write your code simple that's it you
write your code simple that's it you
don't like you don't have any fancy
don't like you don't have any fancy
ideas that you're trying to
ideas that you're trying to
impose just write your simple
code stay away from functional
code stay away from functional
programming be my
programming be my
advice it's just it's another
advice it's just it's another
objectoriented programming they replaced
objectoriented programming they replaced
one dog mod with another okay here it is
one dog mod with another okay here it is
gym torch rapid sensor tensor
that's not quite it
dude
dude
where how do I manage to delete a line
where how do I manage to delete a line
I'm like just tired I don't know how I
I'm like just tired I don't know how I
manage to do
that like fault is weird
the seg fault is very
weird oh it's probably because the
weird oh it's probably because the
action space sample
huh yeah I bet it's because of that hold
huh yeah I bet it's because of that hold
on
still seg FS
still seg FS
really I guess the action space must be
really I guess the action space must be
the wrong shape
single action
single action
space how do you figure out the action
space how do you figure out the action
space and Isaac gem
actually
what
now 153 okay that is actually
correct that is actually
correct what if I do
what if I comment the
what if I comment the
actions can I do
actions can I do
that I just want this to run
stably it's still seg
faults is it
this it dis
appears well it renders for a second at
appears well it renders for a second at
least
the only place functional kind of makes
the only place functional kind of makes
a little bit of sense is when you're
a little bit of sense is when you're
working with data
working with data
frames like when you're chaining SQL
frames like when you're chaining SQL
queries together that's kind
of so it has a use case but it's a NE
of so it has a use case but it's a NE
use case if you try to use it everywhere
use case if you try to use it everywhere
you're just
dumb what do you wait so so what do you
dumb what do you wait so so what do you
do so what do you actually do I'm
current I'm not pro procedure like I can
current I'm not pro procedure like I can
write code however this is just
write code however this is just
easier and no it's not the only one this
easier and no it's not the only one this
is incredibly common like literally

anybody like the vast majority of lower

like a lot of code is written this way
like a lot of code is written this way
in fact because C doesn't have built-in
in fact because C doesn't have built-in
objectoriented features so you either
objectoriented features so you either
Frankenstein something or you write the
Frankenstein something or you write the

actually push you towards writing code a
actually push you towards writing code a
certain way right so in Python you don't
certain way right so in Python you don't
have structs see if you had a struct
have structs see if you had a struct
object then you would be more inclined
object then you would be more inclined
to write code this way because you could
to write code this way because you could
write functions that just operate on
write functions that just operate on
those strs you don't have structs you
those strs you don't have structs you
have data classes data classes though
have data classes data classes though
those can have methods too so you get
those can have methods too so you get
tempted to add some really what is a
tempted to add some really what is a
data class but just a class anyways with
data class but just a class anyways with
some annoying things you just turn it
some annoying things you just turn it
into a regular class and then you may as
into a regular class and then you may as
well just add the methods to the class
well just add the methods to the class
directly then you may as well just add

some inheritance here and there and then
some inheritance here and there and then
before you know it your code base
before you know it your code base
sucks language pushes you towards that
sucks language pushes you towards that
you can write code without that but the
you can write code without that but the
language pushes you towards it C on the
language pushes you towards it C on the
other hand it pushes you towards writing
other hand it pushes you towards writing
code the way that I described because

you have strs which are just pieces of

operate on

strs you don't really have the ability
to turn things into objects that take

weird void star thing which is so
weird void star thing which is so
awkward that you don't really try to do
awkward that you don't really try to do
it because it's just kind of
stupid it's just you've been lied to as
stupid it's just you've been lied to as
all you've just like you've seen too
all you've just like you've seen too
much code written this one way and it's
much code written this one way and it's
like ah this is the way the code is
like ah this is the way the code is
written but this is not the way the code
written but this is not the way the code
is written lots of code is written in
is written lots of code is written in
other
ways like I said I get lots of sleep I
ways like I said I get lots of sleep I
wish I could figure out why this thing
wish I could figure out why this thing
opens for just a second and then crashes
opens for just a second and then crashes
cuz like there's the robot it disappears
cuz like there's the robot it disappears
and then it crashes
does it crash after one step or is there
does it crash after one step or is there
like a horizon that I'm
missing let's see one 2
missing let's see one 2
4 it's
like dude you should get sleep just go
like dude you should get sleep just go
to sleep now now it's incredibly
important like I'm going to get eight
important like I'm going to get eight
or9 hours of sleep I don't have the
or9 hours of sleep I don't have the
schedule I get to sleep whenever the

hell I
hell I
want right I'm getting work done so I'm
want right I'm getting work done so I'm
working
I know how to write code that way it's
I know how to write code that way it's
just
just
bad I'll spend more time debugging it
bad I'll spend more time debugging it
than if I were to write code this way
than if I were to write code this way
it'll be less stable it'll have more
it'll be less stable it'll have more
bugs and more problems and it'll be
bugs and more problems and it'll be
harder to modify because there'll be
harder to modify because there'll be
more of it I've done this for like 10
more of it I've done this for like 10
years man
it's like you can write passable
it's like you can write passable
objectoriented code but it's always
objectoriented code but it's always
going to be harder to like understand
going to be harder to like understand
than uh than something procedural at

you know
you know
see how you like
it this is so confusing as to why
it this is so confusing as to why
this thing doesn't
work I mean like pie torch is fine pie
work I mean like pie torch is fine pie
torch is like object oriented API is
torch is like object oriented API is
fine right that's a good example of
fine right that's a good example of
something that's like fine
right because it's very horizontal right
right because it's very horizontal right
it doesn't go
it doesn't go
deep right it's just a bunch of
deep right it's just a bunch of
like there's like a like a module and
like there's like a like a module and
it's very horizontal there just a bunch
it's very horizontal there just a bunch
of modules that all have the same API
of modules that all have the same API
that's
that's
fine as soon as you start going
deep and a lot of the time the
deep and a lot of the time the
horizontal doesn't even need to be
horizontal not
horizontal not
necessarily it depends who you talk to
man oh look at all the Bots I see
man oh look at all the Bots I see
multiple
multiple
Bots
Bots
okay and then you
okay and then you
simulate on the second render step you
fail why do you fail on the second
fail why do you fail on the second
render step is that a thing
the Bots are
gone and then it's say
gone and then it's say
fults okay so something's going very
fults okay so something's going very
wrong
wrong
here um I think if I do hold
on if I do this
SW is the
SW is the
thing
friender well yeah but you're Court like
friender well yeah but you're Court like
you shouldn't pay too much attention to
you shouldn't pay too much attention to
that and honestly they really don't you
that and honestly they really don't you
take like
take like
um I think the very first intro course
um I think the very first intro course
is in Java and then after that
is in Java and then after that
gone all your system courses won't
gone all your system courses won't
be okay that's interesting you don't
be okay that's interesting you don't
even have to run simulate and it's still
even have to run simulate and it's still
uh it still
fails they're all the robots
H now it's failing on the
step my systems courses unfortunately
step my systems courses unfortunately

does not seg fault now
right oh [ __ ] maybe it
