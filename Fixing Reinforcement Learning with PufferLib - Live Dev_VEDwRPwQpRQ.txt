distracting oh I forgot what
is this thing stable
now I think
so thank do all of the M's have
correct mob
long
long
yeah these ones have
yeah these ones have
proper initializers
five six seven 8 nine okay good so these
five six seven 8 nine okay good so these
all have good initializers
let's try this
this
works24 instances this should work I
think name Breakout
ah puffer Li
environments yeah so let's fix that
yeah so right
[Music]

here. ocean
no attribute and creator
this whole registry thing strikes me as
this whole registry thing strikes me as
kind of stupid the more I think about it
can't I just do like fromer
can't I just do like fromer
lib
lib
do if it's not the Internet it's the
do if it's not the Internet it's the
damn camera today I
swear oh from puffer li.
swear oh from puffer li.
ocean break
out so why does that not
out so why does that not
work is that
not
breakout breakout. Breakout
yeah so that's
yeah so that's
obnoxious that's super
obnoxious so what I want is I want to
obnoxious so what I want is I want to
just be able to have puffer li. ocean
just be able to have puffer li. ocean
import puffer li. ocean and then you see
import puffer li. ocean and then you see
all the environments
right or you import from you import the
right or you import from you import the
specific
specific
environment okay let me think about that
cuz I actually don't need this whole end
cuz I actually don't need this whole end
Creator
Creator
like this is a pattern that I
like this is a pattern that I
took from other annoying environments
took from other annoying environments
where you couldn't get access to their
where you couldn't get access to their
source
I think puffer ocean is going to be
I think puffer ocean is going to be
better we're just going to have the
better we're just going to have the
bindings available directly that's a
bindings available directly that's a
pretty nice that'll be a very nice
pretty nice that'll be a very nice
Improvement
actually e
I think you have to
do let me see if this
works
snake can you just do this for
that's Bizarro right is that just not
updated where is
updated where is
snake even getting added here
connect
connect
for oh cuz it's the the directory I
see I don't think it's a good idea to
see I don't think it's a good idea to
have to import all the freaking
have to import all the freaking
environments
yeah that's super obnoxious
I always run into this stupid problem in
I always run into this stupid problem in
python as
python as
well is this stream even
well is this stream even
up can't even tell if the stream is
up H yeah it's
up so what I want to do right is I want
up so what I want to do right is I want
to have something like from puffer li.
to have something like from puffer li.
ocean import

in the freaking
in the freaking
CLA I cannot be
asked
asked
have oper Li ocean I
slash

snake
Pake I
want
snake up
so that's what I'm currently doing I'm
so that's what I'm currently doing I'm
probably just missing an anit file
that's kind of gross
yeah that is
yeah that is
cancer python packaging in general just
cancer python packaging in general just
freaking
sucks I guess we'll just make sure that
sucks I guess we'll just make sure that
they're all fast
um so I basically I already have it
um so I basically I already have it
here and then what's wrong
this should actually work then shouldn't
it oh
it's do I just do it here
you have to do
this that works and if I take this out
oh it still works
the only alternative to this is to put
the only alternative to this is to put
the rappers themselves
the rappers themselves
into uh ocean in it
right to fix the packaging
I will consider
I will consider
that that might not be terrible because
that that might not be terrible because
then you would just get puff for.

not doing that for now for
not doing that for now for

did oh it does work I don't know what
did oh it does work I don't know what
was wrong
before
yeah did I not write this hold on
oh you do need this just didn't
oh you do need this just didn't
write that's really
obnoxious okay I don't like that but
whatever what the heck for
we might actually want to just add a
we might actually want to just add a
perf T generally to Native
puffer and then this end crator thing is
puffer and then this end crator thing is
just an
just an
alias barely even needs to exist
frankly e
okay so I think this is good this is an
okay so I think this is good this is an
improvement uh I don't know if any of
improvement uh I don't know if any of
these other ones actually
these other ones actually
work like these ones these are going to
work like these ones these are going to
end up getting done with uh ocean Sandy
end up getting done with uh ocean Sandy
rework I think
that's a good improvement though that's

okay
okay
um there's also the matter of like all
um there's also the matter of like all
this garbage and
snake I think I can just clean this up

good you don't need wait see snake
