Okay, now this is the one that didn't

Okay, we will

Try

this is
fine. Let's see how this does.
Is this like immediately way
better? This is the only end I'm a bit
better? This is the only end I'm a bit
worried about because we're using this

actively for curriculum stuff.
Um, okay. So, the fact that this just

I think what I'm going to do is I'm

Okay, so this is what I was trying to do
Okay, so this is what I was trying to do
last night, but I just got too tired.
Um, I think we can probably figure this
Um, I think we can probably figure this

you need to have on policy rows

this less than

Um, the issue is that there are a bunch

fill up trajectory

I'm kind of tempted

whatever.
So just collect as many steps as you

need in the

that doesn't work

Okay. We can do something like that.
We don't get any indexing bugs from

Was this eight or
16? I think this was 16 before, wasn't
16? I think this was 16 before, wasn't

If this breaks
it. Okay. So, this doesn't break
it. This is faster as well.
There should be a way to break this
There should be a way to break this
though. Like if I just do a 64, this
though. Like if I just do a 64, this
should just break,
right? Yep.
Okay.
I Okay, I don't know what's going on

seems like this is reream because I go

this is unstable reream server today or
this is unstable reream server today or
what, but I'm just going to work around

something out

So it would make sense to have

4K forward pass batch size with this,

So num ms here should be
16. Also, wouldn't this be like way

did like like something like this?
