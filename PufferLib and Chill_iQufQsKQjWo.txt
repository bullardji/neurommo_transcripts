less more replaceable, right? which is
actually a good thing for the system
actually a good thing for the system
overall, but not good for you
overall, but not good for you
personally.
personally.
Yeah. So, this is why you just ignore
Yeah. So, this is why you just ignore
these dumb incentive structures because
these dumb incentive structures because
get nothing done.
get nothing done.
Yes, exactly. Um I've been getting a lot
Yes, exactly. Um I've been getting a lot
more done after I left my job, let me
more done after I left my job, let me
tell you. Or after I was forcibly
tell you. Or after I was forcibly
removed from my job. Um I've been
removed from my job. Um I've been
getting a lot of done a lot done. I had
getting a lot of done a lot done. I had
uh my first sim to real success today,
uh my first sim to real success today,
by the way, just about like 30 minutes
by the way, just about like 30 minutes
ago.

Do you know Do you want to know what the
Do you know Do you want to know what the
last bug was?
last bug was?
Yeah. You had to Didn't you literally
Yeah. You had to Didn't you literally
have Was it like an accelerometer or
have Was it like an accelerometer or
something that was sideways?
something that was sideways?
Yeah, my Yeah, my accelerometer was like
Yeah, my Yeah, my accelerometer was like
the wrong orientation.
the wrong orientation.
You know, I've actually You could
You know, I've actually You could
technically you could technically make
technically you could technically make
it so that it would still be able to fly
it so that it would still be able to fly
that way.
that way.
Yeah. I I I was honestly getting so
Yeah. I I I was honestly getting so
pissed
pissed
about like the random like the like
about like the random like the like
trying to figure out orientation through
trying to figure out orientation through
the three different nodes I was I was
the three different nodes I was I was
managing. Yeah, I agree. Uh the three
managing. Yeah, I agree. Uh the three
different modes I was nodes I was
different modes I was nodes I was
managing. I I I seriously consider just
managing. I I I seriously consider just
adding like domain randomization on like
adding like domain randomization on like
the control stick channels and like
the control stick channels and like
letting it figure it out. But what I
letting it figure it out. But what I
noticed with uh so I mean right now I'm
noticed with uh so I mean right now I'm
using uh
using uh
yes I mean it would it would actually
yes I mean it would it would actually
work too
work too
actually work. Um so my setup right now
actually work. Um so my setup right now
is I I'm doing the simplest I mean I'm
is I I'm doing the simplest I mean I'm
doing the simplest thing possible which
doing the simplest thing possible which
is I have an ESP32 on the device. It's
is I have an ESP32 on the device. It's
sending back the data over over the air
sending back the data over over the air
to my to my control system and that's
to my to my control system and that's
outputting the control inputs to I've I
outputting the control inputs to I've I
basically hacked a bunch of to to
basically hacked a bunch of to to
to do this. I mean it it actually works
to do this. I mean it it actually works
like the the the thing I was like really
like the the the thing I was like really
struggling with I think yesterday. So
struggling with I think yesterday. So
before yesterday, I learned all about
before yesterday, I learned all about
reward design where I
reward design where I
uh I learned all about reward design
uh I learned all about reward design
about like the difference between sparse
about like the difference between sparse
rewards and dense rewards. And I
rewards and dense rewards. And I
actually like took it to practice like I
actually like took it to practice like I
actually like you know change the
actually like you know change the
difference like dense reward versus
difference like dense reward versus
sparse reward, negative versus positive.
sparse reward, negative versus positive.
And I had the model do things like
And I had the model do things like
suicide to pre to prevent the punishment
suicide to pre to prevent the punishment
that was too severe for it. And the
that was too severe for it. And the
thing I realized was just get I mean
thing I realized was just get I mean
like my my general rule of thumb that
like my my general rule of thumb that
I've developed now is give it give it
I've developed now is give it give it
sparse rewards and modulate the rewards
sparse rewards and modulate the rewards
every set of steps and the set of steps

Uh yeah, there actually I've had a bunch
Uh yeah, there actually I've had a bunch
of people annoyed with that. There are
of people annoyed with that. There are
some approximations we make that can
some approximations we make that can
potentially mess some stuff up with that
potentially mess some stuff up with that
with puffer, but also just the kind of
with puffer, but also just the kind of
hard for the LSMs to actually remember
hard for the LSMs to actually remember
that far back.
that far back.
Um I did you did you see the way that I
Um I did you did you see the way that I
did my dense rewards for the drones?
did my dense rewards for the drones?
I've not looked at that. I I think you
I've not looked at that. I I think you
had like episode return increasing over
had like episode return increasing over

Okay. Everyone does dense rewards wrong
Okay. Everyone does dense rewards wrong
and most of the material you're going to
and most of the material you're going to
read about it is wrong. Um,
read about it is wrong. Um,
okay.
okay.
It's like dramatically better to do
It's like dramatically better to do
deltas than it is to just do like state
deltas than it is to just do like state
based.

The state based would be like,
The state based would be like,
okay,
okay,
you know, one minus my distance to the
you know, one minus my distance to the

That's a delta of the same information,
That's a delta of the same information,
right?
right?
It gives you a much larger dynamic.
It gives you a much larger dynamic.
naturally just
you cut out.

I think I've
I think I've
actually ended up doing it like that for
my
wars in general. It's like they're

always delta based.
always delta based.
Well, that's how we had it originally.

I hope so. Where is Where is Finn? Let

Oh no, he's going to see me messing
Oh no, he's going to see me messing
around here instead of helping him with

he's messaged me yet.
he's messaged me yet.
He's probably doing uh either on a on a

Yeah. Yeah. You haven't you haven't been

uh Yeah. Lunar lander is a real thing.
uh Yeah. Lunar lander is a real thing.
Uh um it wasn't landing last time last
Uh um it wasn't landing last time last

Well, no. I just like it's a simple end,

I was measuring latency between like my

Yeah, that's kind of what we were going
Yeah, that's kind of what we were going
to do as well. So I basically I have
to do as well. So I basically I have
this theory that like all of hardware

Um yes. Now the problem though,
Um yes. Now the problem though,
uh this will work for drones. I think
uh this will work for drones. I think
we'll get it to work for Six Degree of

Freedom Arms at some point when I get
Freedom Arms at some point when I get
around to either doing that or having a
around to either doing that or having a
contributor make that sim. Uh, it's a
contributor make that sim. Uh, it's a
hard one, but if anybody wants to take a
hard one, but if anybody wants to take a
crack at it, be my guest. Um, I stuff
crack at it, be my guest. Um, I stuff
like humanoids will be harder because
like humanoids will be harder because
you kind of actually need to do real
you kind of actually need to do real
physics. U, but I think that like
physics. U, but I think that like
humanoids are kind of lame anyways. So,
humanoids are kind of lame anyways. So,
if we just do arms really well, that'll
if we just do arms really well, that'll
already be good.

and like trying to work with that and
like jacks and stuff. Um, when I found
like jacks and stuff. Um, when I found

I was able to like make make so much
I was able to like make make so much

The crazy thing is I know exactly how to
The crazy thing is I know exactly how to
make it 10 times better as well. Just
make it 10 times better as well. Just
I'm getting bogged down by all the uh
I'm getting bogged down by all the uh
the recent work on you know building out
the recent work on you know building out
other applications, contracts and stuff
other applications, contracts and stuff
like that. But I will be back to doing
like that. But I will be back to doing
core dev pretty.
core dev pretty.
So like what were you thinking to like
So like what were you thinking to like
increase that? I I 100% believe you. I'm
increase that? I I 100% believe you. I'm
looking at like my GPU util and like I'm
looking at like my GPU util and like I'm
coming up with ideas like okay like
coming up with ideas like okay like
probably this could probably be faster
probably this could probably be faster
here and there. Um but what what are you
here and there. Um but what what are you
like planning to do?
like planning to do?
I mean there are kind of two things. One
I mean there are kind of two things. One
is core algorithms just are not where
is core algorithms just are not where
they need to be yet. Um there's been so
they need to be yet. Um there's been so
much research done on core algos but
much research done on core algos but
it's all done on really slow ends and
it's all done on really slow ends and
really really dicey experimental setups.
really really dicey experimental setups.
So we have to go back to that. There
So we have to go back to that. There
have been some recent pubs that I'm I
have been some recent pubs that I'm I
think have a decent chance of working.
think have a decent chance of working.
So there's that aspect. And then the
So there's that aspect. And then the
other big thing is just like can compute
other big thing is just like can compute
MFU and see that the GPU is nowhere near
MFU and see that the GPU is nowhere near
P. Uh it's just nobody optimizes for
P. Uh it's just nobody optimizes for
these really small models. Um there's a
these really small models. Um there's a
lot of info we have to do to actually
lot of info we have to do to actually
get these running at near P. Puffer
get these running at near P. Puffer
could easily be 10 million steps per
could easily be 10 million steps per
second. It could probably be 20 million
second. It could probably be 20 million
steps per second. Right.
Yes.
Yes.
And then if you can do that, then it's
And then if you can do that, then it's
like you're just training on pabytes on
like you're just training on pabytes on
one GPU at that point.
one GPU at that point.
I mean, I can't like begin to like, you
I mean, I can't like begin to like, you
know, the most the highest value
know, the most the highest value
returns. My baby's my baby's having
returns. My baby's my baby's having
competition here. Um, but
he's currently he's currently trying to
he's currently he's currently trying to
back my car.
[Music]
the highest value return was like just
the highest value return was like just
being able to see your results so
being able to see your results so
quickly back and like being able to run
quickly back and like being able to run
many different experiments
many different experiments
because at the end of the day experiment
because at the end of the day experiment
that you're going to run depends on the
that you're going to run depends on the
previous experiment that you've already
previous experiment that you've already
run. So being able to close the
run. So being able to close the
development, the sequential development
development, the sequential development
is how you make progress. And for me
is how you make progress. And for me
like I I wouldn't have been able to make
like I I wouldn't have been able to make
this progress if I didn't find
this progress if I didn't find
infrastructure to learn the exact so
infrastructure to learn the exact so
that I could myself gain the experience
that I could myself gain the experience
be able to do.
be able to do.
Yeah. Well, the dev cycle's got to come
Yeah. Well, the dev cycle's got to come
down, I think, even more because right
down, I think, even more because right
now it's only short for very simple
now it's only short for very simple
problems. Uh it's still too long for
problems. Uh it's still too long for
like medium complexity problems.
like medium complexity problems.
There are two things that go to that
There are two things that go to that
though, right? So there's making the
though, right? So there's making the
thing faster, but also just poor
thing faster, but also just poor
algorithm progress also helps. I mean,
algorithm progress also helps. I mean,
the problems that we take on now is

Of course, I actually have to find the

Set the checkpoint frequency. You can

actually a good thing for the system
overall, but not good for you
overall, but not good for you
personally.
personally.
Yeah. So, this is why you just ignore
Yeah. So, this is why you just ignore
these dumb incentive structures because
these dumb incentive structures because
get nothing done.
get nothing done.
Yes, exactly. Um I've been getting a lot
Yes, exactly. Um I've been getting a lot
more done after I left my job, let me
more done after I left my job, let me
tell you. Or after I was forcibly
tell you. Or after I was forcibly
removed from my job. Um I've been
removed from my job. Um I've been
getting a lot of done a lot done. I had
getting a lot of done a lot done. I had
uh my first sim to real success today,
uh my first sim to real success today,
by the way, just about like 30 minutes
by the way, just about like 30 minutes
ago.

Do you know Do you want to know what the
Do you know Do you want to know what the
last bug was?
last bug was?
Yeah. You had to Didn't you literally
Yeah. You had to Didn't you literally
have Was it like an accelerometer or
have Was it like an accelerometer or
something that was sideways?
something that was sideways?
Yeah, my Yeah, my accelerometer was like
Yeah, my Yeah, my accelerometer was like
the wrong orientation.
the wrong orientation.
You know, I've actually You could
You know, I've actually You could
technically you could technically make
technically you could technically make
it so that it would still be able to fly
it so that it would still be able to fly
that way.
that way.
Yeah. I I I was honestly getting so
Yeah. I I I was honestly getting so
pissed
pissed
about like the random like the like
about like the random like the like
trying to figure out orientation through
trying to figure out orientation through
the three different nodes I was I was
the three different nodes I was I was
managing. Yeah, I agree. Uh the three
managing. Yeah, I agree. Uh the three
different modes I was nodes I was
different modes I was nodes I was
managing. I I I seriously consider just
managing. I I I seriously consider just
adding like domain randomization on like
adding like domain randomization on like
the control stick channels and like
the control stick channels and like
letting it figure it out. But what I
letting it figure it out. But what I
noticed with uh so I mean right now I'm
noticed with uh so I mean right now I'm
using uh
using uh
yes I mean it would it would actually
yes I mean it would it would actually
work too
work too
actually work. Um so my setup right now
actually work. Um so my setup right now
is I I'm doing the simplest I mean I'm
is I I'm doing the simplest I mean I'm
doing the simplest thing possible which
doing the simplest thing possible which
is I have an ESP32 on the device. It's
is I have an ESP32 on the device. It's
sending back the data over over the air
sending back the data over over the air
to my to my control system and that's

outputting the control inputs to I've I
outputting the control inputs to I've I
basically hacked a bunch of to to
basically hacked a bunch of to to
to do this. I mean it it actually works
to do this. I mean it it actually works
like the the the thing I was like really
like the the the thing I was like really
struggling with I think yesterday. So
struggling with I think yesterday. So
before yesterday, I learned all about
before yesterday, I learned all about
reward design where I
reward design where I
uh I learned all about reward design
uh I learned all about reward design
about like the difference between sparse
about like the difference between sparse
rewards and dense rewards. And I
rewards and dense rewards. And I
actually like took it to practice like I
actually like took it to practice like I
actually like you know change the
actually like you know change the
difference like dense reward versus
difference like dense reward versus
sparse reward, negative versus positive.
sparse reward, negative versus positive.
And I had the model do things like
And I had the model do things like
suicide to pre to prevent the punishment
suicide to pre to prevent the punishment
that was too severe for it. And the
that was too severe for it. And the
thing I realized was just get I mean
thing I realized was just get I mean
like my my general rule of thumb that
like my my general rule of thumb that
I've developed now is give it give it
I've developed now is give it give it
sparse rewards and modulate the rewards
sparse rewards and modulate the rewards
every set of steps and the set of steps

Uh yeah, there actually I've had a bunch
Uh yeah, there actually I've had a bunch
of people annoyed with that. There are
of people annoyed with that. There are
some approximations we make that can
some approximations we make that can
potentially mess some stuff up with that
potentially mess some stuff up with that
with puffer, but also just the kind of
with puffer, but also just the kind of
hard for the LSMs to actually remember

that far back.
that far back.
Um I did you did you see the way that I
Um I did you did you see the way that I
did my dense rewards for the drones?
did my dense rewards for the drones?
I've not looked at that. I I think you
I've not looked at that. I I think you
had like episode return increasing over
had like episode return increasing over

Okay. Everyone does dense rewards wrong
Okay. Everyone does dense rewards wrong
and most of the material you're going to
and most of the material you're going to
read about it is wrong. Um,
read about it is wrong. Um,
okay.
okay.
It's like dramatically better to do
It's like dramatically better to do
deltas than it is to just do like state
deltas than it is to just do like state
based.

The state based would be like,
The state based would be like,
okay,
okay,
you know, one minus my distance to the
you know, one minus my distance to the

That's a delta of the same information,
That's a delta of the same information,
right?
right?
It gives you a much larger dynamic.
It gives you a much larger dynamic.
naturally just
you cut out.

I think I've
I think I've
actually ended up doing it like that for
my
wars in general. It's like they're

always delta based.
always delta based.
Well, that's how we had it originally.

I hope so. Where is Where is Finn? Let

Oh no, he's going to see me messing

He's probably doing uh either on a on a

Yeah. Yeah. You haven't you haven't been

uh Yeah. Lunar lander is a real thing.
uh Yeah. Lunar lander is a real thing.
Uh um it wasn't landing last time last

Well, no. I just like it's a simple end,

I was measuring latency between like my

Yeah, that's kind of what we were going
Yeah, that's kind of what we were going
to do as well. So I basically I have
to do as well. So I basically I have
this theory that like all of hardware

Um yes. Now the problem though,
Um yes. Now the problem though,
uh this will work for drones. I think
uh this will work for drones. I think
we'll get it to work for Six Degree of

Freedom Arms at some point when I get
Freedom Arms at some point when I get
around to either doing that or having a
around to either doing that or having a
contributor make that sim. Uh, it's a
contributor make that sim. Uh, it's a
hard one, but if anybody wants to take a
hard one, but if anybody wants to take a
crack at it, be my guest. Um, I stuff
crack at it, be my guest. Um, I stuff
like humanoids will be harder because
like humanoids will be harder because
you kind of actually need to do real
you kind of actually need to do real
physics. U, but I think that like
physics. U, but I think that like
humanoids are kind of lame anyways. So,
humanoids are kind of lame anyways. So,
if we just do arms really well, that'll
if we just do arms really well, that'll
already be good.

like jacks and stuff. Um, when I found

I was able to like make make so much

The crazy thing is I know exactly how to
The crazy thing is I know exactly how to
make it 10 times better as well. Just
make it 10 times better as well. Just
I'm getting bogged down by all the uh
I'm getting bogged down by all the uh
the recent work on you know building out
the recent work on you know building out
other applications, contracts and stuff
other applications, contracts and stuff
like that. But I will be back to doing
like that. But I will be back to doing
core dev pretty.
core dev pretty.
So like what were you thinking to like
So like what were you thinking to like
increase that? I I 100% believe you. I'm
increase that? I I 100% believe you. I'm
looking at like my GPU util and like I'm
looking at like my GPU util and like I'm
coming up with ideas like okay like
coming up with ideas like okay like
probably this could probably be faster
probably this could probably be faster
here and there. Um but what what are you
here and there. Um but what what are you
like planning to do?
like planning to do?
I mean there are kind of two things. One
I mean there are kind of two things. One
is core algorithms just are not where
is core algorithms just are not where
they need to be yet. Um there's been so
they need to be yet. Um there's been so
much research done on core algos but
much research done on core algos but
it's all done on really slow ends and
it's all done on really slow ends and
really really dicey experimental setups.
really really dicey experimental setups.
So we have to go back to that. There
So we have to go back to that. There
have been some recent pubs that I'm I
have been some recent pubs that I'm I
think have a decent chance of working.
think have a decent chance of working.
So there's that aspect. And then the
So there's that aspect. And then the
other big thing is just like can compute
other big thing is just like can compute
MFU and see that the GPU is nowhere near
MFU and see that the GPU is nowhere near
P. Uh it's just nobody optimizes for
P. Uh it's just nobody optimizes for
these really small models. Um there's a
these really small models. Um there's a
lot of info we have to do to actually
lot of info we have to do to actually
get these running at near P. Puffer
get these running at near P. Puffer
could easily be 10 million steps per
could easily be 10 million steps per
second. It could probably be 20 million
second. It could probably be 20 million
steps per second. Right.
Yes.
Yes.
And then if you can do that, then it's
And then if you can do that, then it's
like you're just training on pabytes on
like you're just training on pabytes on
one GPU at that point.
one GPU at that point.
I mean, I can't like begin to like, you
I mean, I can't like begin to like, you
know, the most the highest value
know, the most the highest value
returns. My baby's my baby's having
returns. My baby's my baby's having
competition here. Um, but
he's currently he's currently trying to
he's currently he's currently trying to
back my car.
[Music]
the highest value return was like just
the highest value return was like just
being able to see your results so
being able to see your results so
quickly back and like being able to run
quickly back and like being able to run
many different experiments
many different experiments
because at the end of the day experiment
because at the end of the day experiment
that you're going to run depends on the
that you're going to run depends on the
previous experiment that you've already
previous experiment that you've already
run. So being able to close the
run. So being able to close the
development, the sequential development
development, the sequential development
is how you make progress. And for me
is how you make progress. And for me
like I I wouldn't have been able to make
like I I wouldn't have been able to make
this progress if I didn't find
this progress if I didn't find
infrastructure to learn the exact so
infrastructure to learn the exact so
that I could myself gain the experience
that I could myself gain the experience
be able to do.
be able to do.
Yeah. Well, the dev cycle's got to come
Yeah. Well, the dev cycle's got to come
down, I think, even more because right
down, I think, even more because right
now it's only short for very simple
now it's only short for very simple
problems. Uh it's still too long for
problems. Uh it's still too long for
like medium complexity problems.
like medium complexity problems.
There are two things that go to that
There are two things that go to that
though, right? So there's making the
though, right? So there's making the
thing faster, but also just poor
thing faster, but also just poor
algorithm progress also helps. I mean,
algorithm progress also helps. I mean,
the problems that we take on now is

Of course, I actually have to find the

just eval different checkpoints.
just eval different checkpoints.
Set the checkpoint frequency. You can
