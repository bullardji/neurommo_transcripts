All we want to do right now, I don't
All we want to do right now, I don't
even know why I streamed this, but I
even know why I streamed this, but I
feel like it. I guess we're just going
feel like it. I guess we're just going
to revise the

Let's go take a quick look at the RLC.

So in that case,
Hey, James. How's it going, man? Yo, I'm

Yeah, I will be there for a few weeks up
Yeah, I will be there for a few weeks up
until RLC and then I then I will be back
until RLC and then I then I will be back
there afterwards.

Meet up if you're still there.
I'm just editing up the uh the
I'm just editing up the uh the
manuscript for RLC right now. This was

accepted. It's completely outdated, but
it was accepted. Uh I think I'm just
it was accepted. Uh I think I'm just
going to add like this one paragraph
going to add like this one paragraph

get one paper accepted and publish a
get one paper accepted and publish a
different one. So, I'm just going to add
different one. So, I'm just going to add
this versioning note and then I'll make

Something like this.
Like a short versioning note.
Hey, Ann. How's it going? What'd you
Hey, Ann. How's it going? What'd you
find with 2048?
using planning. Pretty cool. I think PO
using planning. Pretty cool. I think PO
is all you need. Wait,
is all you need. Wait,
hang on. It seems to be limited not by
hang on. It seems to be limited not by
training time, but rather by model size.
Magictor, you missed the earlier stream.
Magictor, you missed the earlier stream.
There was another stream before this.
I can get it to train to 300
I can get it to train to 300
score. Wait,
score. Wait,
is that 300,000 or is that 300,000?
Huh?
Huh?
You have it to 300,000.
Really?
Huh?
I'm going to want to see the details of
I'm going to want to see the details of
that. This would actually be a very very
that. This would actually be a very very
useful thing for research because
useful thing for research because
usually model size scaling doesn't help,
not what I showed in the UI. Counts for
not what I showed in the UI. Counts for
all the new tiles created.
Wait,
Wait,
20k is basically how does that make
20k is basically how does that make
sense? Because the tiles have to be
sense? Because the tiles have to be
added together.
I definitely want to know what the
I definitely want to know what the
biggest tile is that it made.
This is absolutely useful. Um,
This is absolutely useful. Um,
if we can actually I'm actually kind of
if we can actually I'm actually kind of
surprised that you get this to work
surprised that you get this to work
because like the optimal uh learning
because like the optimal uh learning
rate usually changes with model size and
rate usually changes with model size and
like usually if you keep the same

learning rate it'll collapse if you make

the model too big.
the model too big.
How big of a model did you use? Can I

Did you train for super long or what?

two to the 14 which is 16k.
Okay. I've seen people actually get that
Okay. I've seen people actually get that
score. So yes, that makes sense.
Train for like an hour. How many steps?
Train for like an hour. How many steps?
I want to see curbs on things.
Oh, you used the SPARS that I swept.
Oh, you used the SPARS that I swept.
Okay, that makes sense then
Okay, that makes sense then
because those were like 600 mil or
because those were like 600 mil or
whatever for 2048, which was pretty
whatever for 2048, which was pretty
fast. So, I could see if you train for
fast. So, I could see if you train for
longer, you could do better. And then
longer, you could do better. And then
maybe there is a capacity limit at some
maybe there is a capacity limit at some
point. Huh.
I'll post screenshots since I don't know
I'll post screenshots since I don't know

uh the poster will not be on 20. So what
I'm going to do because we released a
I'm going to do because we released a
new major version and it's kind of

stupid to give a poster presentation on
stupid to give a poster presentation on
an outdated thing. Like I can't rewrite

submit a paper that is different from

Like, getting this thing published was a

total nightmare. Like, this got rejected
total nightmare. Like, this got rejected
from Nurups, I think it was maybe once
from Nurups, I think it was maybe once
or twice, and then it got rejected from

RLC on like by an LLM last year. So,
I'm sick of the writing process. It's a
I'm sick of the writing process. It's a
massive waste of my time. But, we
massive waste of my time. But, we
already had this one, so I guess we do

Let me go see the annex thing.
Let me go see the annex thing.
You only did five bill steps.
That doesn't look like 16k.
That doesn't look like 16k.
Oh, it's log scaled. Yes, it is. Okay.
Are these different model sizes that you
Are these different model sizes that you
wrote me? Let me see.
Yanick, are these different model sizes
Yanick, are these different model sizes
or what are these three different runs?
Why did it get rejected from NIPS? Cuz
Why did it get rejected from NIPS? Cuz
reviewers are dumb.
This is a very very strong scaling
This is a very very strong scaling
result then Yanick like
result then Yanick like
huh
that's all you
This is a very good result.
probably with bigger models. Yeah.
probably with bigger models. Yeah.
Well, it's still going up like
Wait, dude. That's not log linear. Why
Wait, dude. That's not log linear. Why
did you do this?
did you do this?
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why did you log
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why did you log
scale the y- axis, dude? No, no, no, no,
scale the y- axis, dude? No, no, no, no,
no, no. You don't do that. Why? Why
no, no. You don't do that. Why? Why
would you log scale the y- axis?
would you log scale the y- axis?
Can you resend me this with the y-axis
Can you resend me this with the y-axis
not log scaled? I want to make a point.
Yeah, definitely send me that PR.
Yeah, definitely send me that PR.
You can PR the the hypers that you
You can PR the the hypers that you
copied in as well.
But send me that plot real quick. I want

A very good result.
Didn't log scale. Look at the look at

Okay, my bad. But this isn't 16K, right?
Okay, my bad. But this isn't 16K, right?
This is

this is like 7K, right?
All right. Hang on. I got somebody here.
Okay.
Yeah, this is a cool result. Yanick, we

know if he joined the Discord, but if
you message Jackson, I think some of the
you message Jackson, I think some of the
stuff that you're trying to do with like
stuff that you're trying to do with like
hooking up um Beta FOV or whatever, he's
hooking up um Beta FOV or whatever, he's
probably done.
probably done.
But I think you
But I think you
you actually probably should chat with
you actually probably should chat with
him on that stuff. There like will be
him on that stuff. There like will be
useful things there.
Pushing my stuff would be too cool to
Pushing my stuff would be too cool to
test with bigger models. Yeah, I can set
test with bigger models. Yeah, I can set
that up for you real quick. Let me make
that up for you real quick. Let me make
sure I have this done because I don't if
sure I have this done because I don't if
I don't finish this now, I will forget
I don't finish this now, I will forget
and then the deadline will pass for
and then the deadline will pass for
this. Let me finish this. This is super
this. Let me finish this. This is super
quick. But make that PR right now
for algorithmic improvements.
Okay.
And then I have to use where is it? The

There's so many different problems to

I'll have to read the paper.
I'm going to have to see if it's

Okay, we'll get rid of this because like

Yeah, it's a totally different paper.
Man, this is like better to read than

So like this was like the way that this

hard to get a paper published this way.
hard to get a paper published this way.
We kind of just p like we sort of just
We kind of just p like we sort of just
pushed this through by brute force. And
pushed this through by brute force. And
in fact, literally one of the reviewers
in fact, literally one of the reviewers
say that it's like, yeah, this paper's a
say that it's like, yeah, this paper's a
tour to force. Uh, it doesn't really
tour to force. Uh, it doesn't really
give the evidence, but like I don't
give the evidence, but like I don't
doubt that the result is there. And

ultimately, the evidence that is in

have. So like we accept this. Um,
have. So like we accept this. Um,
yeah. I don't know.
And the thing is it's like I do kind of
And the thing is it's like I do kind of
give the evidence like I I discuss all
give the evidence like I I discuss all
the things that make the thing fast,
the things that make the thing fast,
right?
right?
I kind of give you the blueprint.
Well, there aren't any for like you
Well, there aren't any for like you
wouldn't have any formal proofs for
wouldn't have any formal proofs for
this. It's empirical.
and neural MMO 3 was in this as well,
and neural MMO 3 was in this as well,
right?
Yeah, Neural MO3 is in this. How come
Yeah, Neural MO3 is in this. How come
you're still publishing?
you're still publishing?
No, it's the fact that like I wrote this
No, it's the fact that like I wrote this
paper a long time ago. Like this paper
paper a long time ago. Like this paper
is 2.0 0 was from last summer and like
is 2.0 0 was from last summer and like
basically I wrote this paper for puffer
basically I wrote this paper for puffer
10. It was like actually a paper for
10. It was like actually a paper for
puffer 0.7 and this is just how long the
puffer 0.7 and this is just how long the
conference cycle is. So basically I've
conference cycle is. So basically I've
had this paper for the last over a year.
had this paper for the last over a year.
I'm not publishing anymore. It's that
I'm not publishing anymore. It's that
like this is literally left over from
like this is literally left over from
that long ago. Any advice for puffer
that long ago. Any advice for puffer
plus super slow M 20 SPS? I've been
plus super slow M 20 SPS? I've been
increasing update epochs and batch
increasing update epochs and batch
sizes. What are you doing that's 20
sizes. What are you doing that's 20
steps per second? Finn,
steps per second? Finn,
what are you doing?
But yeah, Yanick, there's not like
But yeah, Yanick, there's not like
if the publication process were sane, it
if the publication process were sane, it
actually would be chill to just like
actually would be chill to just like
submit a white paper on each puffer
submit a white paper on each puffer
major version. Like just spend a day or
major version. Like just spend a day or
two writing a white paper. But the thing
two writing a white paper. But the thing
is it takes longer than that and you end
is it takes longer than that and you end
up like going through three cycles
up like going through three cycles
before you actually get something
before you actually get something
published. So it's just there's no
published. So it's just there's no
point.
Like literally, this paper was
Like literally, this paper was
originally made on 1, updated to 2, and
originally made on 1, updated to 2, and
by the time I'm going to present it,
by the time I'm going to present it,
we're going to be like a decent chunk
we're going to be like a decent chunk
into 3 0 like after having already fully

released it.
I do have to add the link.

Yeah, you're kind of just screwed at 20
Yeah, you're kind of just screwed at 20
steps per second, man.
steps per second, man.
like
you build a faster and burm basically.
Like we will eventually do stuff on
Like we will eventually do stuff on
sample efficiency algorithmically
but 20 steps per second is too slow even
but 20 steps per second is too slow even
for that.
They're pretty just kind of just grid.

We add that note.

Let's do the math on that just to show
Let's do the math on that just to show
you how ridiculous that is. Yanick.
All right. So, we have 20 steps per

Okay. Times 24 hours time 7 days.
12 million steps total.
That's 12 million steps in a full week,
That's 12 million steps in a full week,
which is 3 seconds of training uh with

they had a capable renderer,
they had a capable renderer,
okay, what they could do is they could
okay, what they could do is they could
probably get like 20 to 30,000. We'll
probably get like 20 to 30,000. We'll
say 20,000. And now we're at 12 billion
say 20,000. And now we're at 12 billion

is all you need. Wait,
is all you need. Wait,
hang on. It seems to be limited not by

There was another stream before this.
I can get it to train to 300

is that 300,000 or is that 300,000?
Huh?
Huh?
You have it to 300,000.
Really?
Huh?
I'm going to want to see the details of
I'm going to want to see the details of
that. This would actually be a very very
that. This would actually be a very very
useful thing for research because
useful thing for research because
usually model size scaling doesn't help,
not what I showed in the UI. Counts for
not what I showed in the UI. Counts for
all the new tiles created.
Wait,
Wait,
20k is basically how does that make
20k is basically how does that make
sense? Because the tiles have to be

added together.
I definitely want to know what the
I definitely want to know what the
biggest tile is that it made.
This is absolutely useful. Um,
This is absolutely useful. Um,
if we can actually I'm actually kind of
if we can actually I'm actually kind of
surprised that you get this to work

because like the optimal uh learning

Train for like an hour. How many steps?

I want to see curbs on things.
Oh, you used the SPARS that I swept.

Okay, that makes sense then
Okay, that makes sense then
because those were like 600 mil or
because those were like 600 mil or
whatever for 2048, which was pretty
whatever for 2048, which was pretty
fast. So, I could see if you train for
fast. So, I could see if you train for
longer, you could do better. And then
longer, you could do better. And then
maybe there is a capacity limit at some

useful things there.
Pushing my stuff would be too cool to
