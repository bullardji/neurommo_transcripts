Hi.
I think I'm going to start today by
I think I'm going to start today by
writing a quick article because I have
writing a quick article because I have
something on my mind to write about and
something on my mind to write about and
uh I figured I'd do it on stream
uh I figured I'd do it on stream
and then I have a meeting in an hour and
and then I have a meeting in an hour and
a half. So, I think I can probably write
a half. So, I think I can probably write
article in that time and uh maybe get
article in that time and uh maybe get
started on a little bit of drone stuff.
started on a little bit of drone stuff.
After my meeting, I'll be working on
After my meeting, I'll be working on
drone stuff for most of the rest of the
drone stuff for most of the rest of the
day. Hey, Linky, welcome
release all of these, I guess. Did I?
release all of these, I guess. Did I?
Oh, yeah. I guess I didn't really
Oh, yeah. I guess I didn't really
release this. Okay.
Then this ended up just being the tweet.
Then this ended up just being the tweet.
Yeah, that's fine. Uh, let's do new
Welcome
just like quick free form article.
just like quick free form article.
Can we get Yaxine to stream dev? You can
Can we get Yaxine to stream dev? You can
try to. He's definitely working on some
try to. He's definitely working on some
stuff. He sent me some cool things.
I don't know what he's talking about. Uh
I don't know what he's talking about. Uh
yeah, I have no idea.
I'm like a little bit scattered with
I'm like a little bit scattered with
stuff I do. He's like very very
stuff I do. He's like very very
scattered with the type of stuff he
scattered with the type of stuff he
does, you know?
Check my message in near
in new to thread.
in new to thread.
Yes.
first.
Yeah. So, like the nan issue, it's
Yeah. So, like the nan issue, it's
numerical instability most of the time.
numerical instability most of the time.
It's not like, oh, it can't work with
It's not like, oh, it can't work with
sparse rewards or something like that.
I don't think it should be. The thing
I don't think it should be. The thing
that's difficult is the fact that like
that's difficult is the fact that like
it's pretty hard to express these ops on
it's pretty hard to express these ops on
a touring machine. That's it.
I'm curious why did you decide to do a
I'm curious why did you decide to do a
PhD?
Uh if I gotten a full-time offer, I
Uh if I gotten a full-time offer, I
would have stayed.
would have stayed.
Like you uh
Like you uh
it was pretty dang hard to even like
it was pretty dang hard to even like
even being a publishing researcher as an
even being a publishing researcher as an
undergrad.
undergrad.
the positions were almost exclusively
the positions were almost exclusively
for PhDs.
for PhDs.
I mean, and not only that, right, like I
I mean, and not only that, right, like I
also I was pretty stubborn about what I
also I was pretty stubborn about what I
wanted to work on as well. Like I didn't
wanted to work on as well. Like I didn't
kind of just want to work on anything.
kind of just want to work on anything.
I was pretty like I had my mind set
I was pretty like I had my mind set
pretty pretty hard on neural MMO and
pretty pretty hard on neural MMO and
multi- aent and all this stuff. It would
multi- aent and all this stuff. It would
have probably
have probably
it would have had to have been like a
it would have had to have been like a
lab that wanted to bet on an undergrad
lab that wanted to bet on an undergrad
to work on like this crazy ambitious
to work on like this crazy ambitious
project that really could probably only
project that really could probably only
have been done in academia. And I guess
have been done in academia. And I guess
the proof of that, right, is I worked on
the proof of that, right, is I worked on
neural MMO and I didn't expect to do it
neural MMO and I didn't expect to do it
for my entire PhD because I expected,
for my entire PhD because I expected,
you know, one of the big labs to circle
you know, one of the big labs to circle
back and eventually do it way bigger and
back and eventually do it way bigger and
way better and they just never did.
way better and they just never did.
So I was really the only one pushing
So I was really the only one pushing
like despite Starcraft and Dota and all
like despite Starcraft and Dota and all
these things, none of the labs did like
these things, none of the labs did like
a compelling thousand agent learning
a compelling thousand agent learning
problem or like you know economies and
problem or like you know economies and
trade and stuff or any of the things
trade and stuff or any of the things
that we did with neural MMO Oh,
This is underrated to be able to write
This is underrated to be able to write
quality stuff,
quality stuff,
right in one go. It depends on how I'm
right in one go. It depends on how I'm
feeling, man.
feeling, man.
I don't consider this super high
I don't consider this super high
quality.
It's just my thoughts.
curious about your thoughts on scaling
curious about your thoughts on scaling
up nets.
up nets.
The Dota works with one layer, Kevin.
The one layer LSTM you scale with
The one layer LSTM you scale with
And uh we do actually see this
And uh we do actually see this
we see this on some of our problems but
we see this on some of our problems but
it's it's a factor of problem
it's it's a factor of problem
complexity.

So simple problems don't benefit from

more than 128 width.
more than 128 width.
Something like neural MMO so far we've
Something like neural MMO so far we've
gotten it up to 512 doesn't really get
gotten it up to 512 doesn't really get
all that much more from 1024
all that much more from 1024
is massively massively complicated. It's
is massively massively complicated. It's
up to 4096.
I think that people have this bias in
I think that people have this bias in
their head that because LMs are big,
their head that because LMs are big,
then everything needs to be big. But
then everything needs to be big. But
it's just not true. RL's just a data
it's just not true. RL's just a data
sponge. You don't need that big of
sponge. You don't need that big of
networks

to solve things.
Now I will say if you have a supervised
Now I will say if you have a supervised
objective in your RL then that can scale
objective in your RL then that can scale
which is a thing I wanted to look at
which is a thing I wanted to look at
with you right so I don't think that you
with you right so I don't think that you
necessarily need to scale the policy
necessarily need to scale the policy
massively but if you have some
massively but if you have some
supervised objective like a world model
supervised objective like a world model
or a contrastive objective or whatever
or a contrastive objective or whatever
that it seems can scale and there's good
that it seems can scale and there's good
evidence

dropping by say the goat works

keep on keeping on. Thank you very much.
If you want to get involved with this

I'm not going to take too much of uh

I'll have to look at this.
I'll have to look at this.
And you know the other thing that's just
And you know the other thing that's just
really screwy, Kevin,
really screwy, Kevin,
I can look at this. Here's the thing
I can look at this. Here's the thing
that just sucks. Okay,
that just sucks. Okay,
I treat publications as false by default
I treat publications as false by default
now in RL.
now in RL.
You know, like when I read a new
You know, like when I read a new
publication, I assume it's wrong by
publication, I assume it's wrong by
default because that's literally been a
default because that's literally been a
better prior than anything else. you've
better prior than anything else. you've
replicated it. Does it work more
replicated it. Does it work more
broadly?
broadly?
Does there's a difference between
Does there's a difference between
replicating the exact thing and it
replicating the exact thing and it
actually being general, right?
Write it in my own M. Okay. See, that is
Write it in my own M. Okay. See, that is
useful information.
I don't want to get too super
I don't want to get too super
sidetracked by this now because I'll get
sidetracked by this now because I'll get
out of like a writing flow, but um I
out of like a writing flow, but um I
will take a look at this. If you're
will take a look at this. If you're
around later today as well, we can take
around later today as well, we can take
a look at this together. I will be more
a look at this together. I will be more
than happy to uh to do that.
If you try it on Puffer M, that's like
If you try it on Puffer M, that's like
25 data points. And if it works on
25 data points. And if it works on
neural MMO 3 or even if it works on
neural MMO 3 or even if it works on
mazes, mazes is like a fast training
mazes, mazes is like a fast training
environment that replicates like the
environment that replicates like the
transfers really well then uh that will

be much stronger evidence.
Good to know. I'm working on applied

and I I don't know what applied to BS is
and I I don't know what applied to BS is
in the Discord when I gain a little more
in the Discord when I gain a little more
experience. Yeah, there are literally we

have undergrads who are doing some of

There's no bias on experience level.

We've had dozens of people spin up in

Like if you have any sort of programming

you're going to make be able to make one
you're going to make be able to make one

somebody had just showed me this type of

That's not going to a lot of stuff but
That's not going to a lot of stuff but
I'll have to look at it.
All
right. Well, it looks like we got lots
right. Well, it looks like we got lots
of questions, but our other contributors

are handling them. So, good. More time
are handling them. So, good. More time
for drones.
So, let me see if I can remember

Uh,
there's a bit of trouble where it was

kind of a pain to get this stuff to

I said I was going to do, but I didn't
I said I was going to do, but I didn't
because more meetings. Um,
but at least we do know based on this,
but at least we do know based on this,
we do know that the uh the score is

That's the way to interpret that because

the metric that it's optimizing is doing
the metric that it's optimizing is doing
well, but the metrics we care about is

I think that's the correct

Now it does occur to me as well that

I guess technically Play.
Let me see what happens if we do this.

So, I'm just going to swap it to like

the sparse reward, which is do you did

you pass a ring or not?
you pass a ring or not?
This should be quite hard to learn.

Uh, and if this works, then

we'll basically know that it's a a

But we'll message him after.
Well, it's passing. It's better, but
Well, it's passing. It's better, but
it's I think it's not passing.
it's I think it's not passing.
Yeah. Multiple rings yet, right?
and know I remember this. This was it
and know I remember this. This was it
like getting stuck only being able to do
like getting stuck only being able to do
one ring,
one ring,
which is still better than what it was
which is still better than what it was
doing before. So that's right.
I did make the rings farther apart. So,
I did make the rings farther apart. So,
if it doesn't have the um the sparse
if it doesn't have the um the sparse
reward, that could screw it up, right?
Go double check real quick.
Want to make sure that the uh the
Want to make sure that the uh the
reward's what I think it is
check ring. Yeah. So it is getting the
check ring. Yeah. So it is getting the
check ring reward which is sparse.
I'm pretty sure I tried the uh the
I'm pretty sure I tried the uh the
sparse reward small map thing though and

I think it didn't work. We'll try it
I think it didn't work. We'll try it
again just to make sure I'm
again just to make sure I'm
not misremembering. Right.
Okay, so this is still broken.
It's interesting to me that we have a
It's interesting to me that we have a
reward that in my mind doesn't make a
reward that in my mind doesn't make a
ton of sense.
but we know it worked on the other the

One one last thing.
One other thing I modified, right?

Like this max rings 10.

Let's actually do one.
We should actually be able to confirm

just based on this.
just based on this.
Now we're as close as possible to the
Now we're as close as possible to the
original setting. So something's totally

broken if it doesn't work on this.
cuz you never know, right? I don't think
cuz you never know, right? I don't think
I'm doing collision checks between the

drones for the racing task, but I could

accidentally be doing collision checks

and then the rings are just like too
and then the rings are just like too
small, right? There like lots of things
small, right? There like lots of things
I could be messing up technically.
Okay.
Okay.
Well,
Well,
There you go.
A little better. See if it keeps

That's definitely a massive difference
whether this is the result that we want

So, if this doesn't train, then it means
So, if this doesn't train, then it means
that there've got to be like collision
that there've got to be like collision

Okay. So, it's the rings somehow.
Okay. So, it's the rings somehow.
How does that make sense? It's the

Doesn't make any sense to me.
This still seems better than before.
Maybe not. Maybe this is the same. The

I was pretty like I had my mind set

multi- aent and all this stuff. It would

to work on like this crazy ambitious

the proof of that, right, is I worked on
the proof of that, right, is I worked on

Now I will say if you have a supervised

which is a thing I wanted to look at
with you right so I don't think that you

If you try it on Puffer M, that's like

I got one meeting in like half an hour

I'll have to look at it.

right. Well, it looks like we got lots
right. Well, it looks like we got lots
of questions, but our other contributors

are handling them. So, good. More time

for drones.
So, let me see if I can remember

Right. So, I was trying to get um
I was trying to get this thing to work
I was trying to get this thing to work
with the new physics, I believe.
with the new physics, I believe.
And I could get it to work with swarming

And it looked Yes. So it was it looked

then I randomly had to leave for um

Okay, so let's see what the uh the
Okay, so let's see what the uh the
current task setup looks like.

So I we were trying to get it to train

on racing and yeah, I remember. So, this
on racing and yeah, I remember. So, this
Perf and score, this is good according

to the reward model, but it's not

Uh,
there's a bit of trouble where it was
there's a bit of trouble where it was
kind of a pain to get this stuff to
kind of a pain to get this stuff to
render.
I said I was going to do, but I didn't
I said I was going to do, but I didn't
because more meetings. Um,
but at least we do know based on this,
but at least we do know based on this,
we do know that the uh the score is
we do know that the uh the score is
good. So, there's a mismatch between
good. So, there's a mismatch between
what the agent thinks that it's training
what the agent thinks that it's training
on or the agent says that it's uh
on or the agent says that it's uh
there's a mismatch between what we think
there's a mismatch between what we think
we're telling the agent to do, what the
we're telling the agent to do, what the
agent is actually being told to do.

That's the way to interpret that because
That's the way to interpret that because
the metric that it's optimizing is doing
the metric that it's optimizing is doing
well, but the metrics we care about is
well, but the metrics we care about is
not doing well. So there's a gap between
not doing well. So there's a gap between
what we're optimizing and what we care
what we're optimizing and what we care
about.

I think that's the correct

interpretation of this.
Now it does occur to me as well that

But we'll message him after.
Well, it's passing. It's better, but
Well, it's passing. It's better, but
it's I think it's not passing.
it's I think it's not passing.
Yeah. Multiple rings yet, right?
and know I remember this. This was it
and know I remember this. This was it
like getting stuck only being able to do
like getting stuck only being able to do
one ring,
one ring,
which is still better than what it was
which is still better than what it was
doing before. So that's right.
I did make the rings farther apart. So,
I did make the rings farther apart. So,
if it doesn't have the um the sparse
if it doesn't have the um the sparse
reward, that could screw it up, right?
Go double check real quick.
Want to make sure that the uh the
Want to make sure that the uh the
reward's what I think it is
check ring. Yeah. So it is getting the
check ring. Yeah. So it is getting the
check ring reward which is sparse.
I'm pretty sure I tried the uh the
I'm pretty sure I tried the uh the
sparse reward small map thing though and
sparse reward small map thing though and
I think it didn't work. We'll try it
I think it didn't work. We'll try it
again just to make sure I'm
again just to make sure I'm
not misremembering. Right.
Okay, so this is still broken.
It's interesting to me that we have a
It's interesting to me that we have a
reward that in my mind doesn't make a
reward that in my mind doesn't make a
ton of sense.
but we know it worked on the other the

other version.

One one last thing.
One other thing I modified, right?

Like this max rings 10.

Let's actually do one.
We should actually be able to confirm

just based on this.
just based on this.
Now we're as close as possible to the
Now we're as close as possible to the
original setting. So something's totally

broken if it doesn't work on this.
cuz you never know, right? I don't think
cuz you never know, right? I don't think
I'm doing collision checks between the
I'm doing collision checks between the
drones for the racing task, but I could

accidentally be doing collision checks

and then the rings are just like too
and then the rings are just like too
small, right? There like lots of things
small, right? There like lots of things
I could be messing up technically.
Okay.
Okay.
Well,
Well,
There you go.
A little better. See if it keeps

That's definitely a massive difference
whether this is the result that we want

So, if this doesn't train, then it means
So, if this doesn't train, then it means
that there've got to be like collision
that there've got to be like collision

Okay. So, it's the rings somehow.
Okay. So, it's the rings somehow.
How does that make sense? It's the

Doesn't make any sense to me.
This still seems better than before.
Maybe not. Maybe this is the same. The
