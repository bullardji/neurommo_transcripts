Hi. We should be back
live. There we go.
So, it is
So, it is
currently 100
currently 100
p.m. I should have
p.m. I should have
roughly almost 5
roughly almost 5
hours to just hammer
hours to just hammer
on all these different M's and baselines
on all these different M's and baselines
uh and experiments. I think that the
uh and experiments. I think that the
major goal right now is going to be to
major goal right now is going to be to
get all or as many as possible of the Ms
get all or as many as possible of the Ms
to have a single score metric that is
to have a single score metric that is
normalized from 0 to one. Um to get
normalized from 0 to one. Um to get
reasonable defaults for all the
reasonable defaults for all the
different M's so that we can then with
different M's so that we can then with
one script run all the M's
one script run all the M's
uh and
uh and
get scores out of one on one plot.
get scores out of one on one plot.
and then even get a combined plot. So
and then even get a combined plot. So
that will give us a very robust
that will give us a very robust
comparison
comparison
uh between these ms and other stuff.
uh between these ms and other stuff.
That's going to be the goal. Welcome
That's going to be the goal. Welcome
YouTube folks. Welcome Twitch folks. So
YouTube folks. Welcome Twitch folks. So
should just be some chill dev, some
should just be some chill dev, some
chill
chill
experimenting. And uh yeah, this should
experimenting. And uh yeah, this should
put us in a pretty good spot for
put us in a pretty good spot for
tomorrow. Um because if we get all this
tomorrow. Um because if we get all this
done then I will be very well set up to
done then I will be very well set up to
do either experiment side stuff or like
do either experiment side stuff or like
new algorithm stuff. Usually I try to
new algorithm stuff. Usually I try to
make Saturday like a long like deep dive
make Saturday like a long like deep dive
algorithm day or whatever or deep dive
algorithm day or whatever or deep dive
edge day. So this should set us up
edge day. So this should set us up
pretty well for that. Um because there
pretty well for that. Um because there
is one bug right now that I'm pretty
is one bug right now that I'm pretty
sure exists in the experience buffer uh
sure exists in the experience buffer uh
that we're going to have to fix before
that we're going to have to fix before
we can do a ton of new stuff and this
we can do a ton of new stuff and this
should help with that.
should help with that.
Okay, so let's get started with
Okay, so let's get started with
it. I believe we have Enduro working.
it. I believe we have Enduro working.
Yes, this has normalized score. Uh the
Yes, this has normalized score. Uh the
one thing that I would like to do if I
one thing that I would like to do if I
could is reorder these so that they show
could is reorder these so that they show
up in a better
up in a better
order. Do you think reinforcement

learning will be as much useful
learning will be as much useful
efficient like other machine learning

techniques or can it surpass them a

different use cases for things? I think
different use cases for things? I think
it is very very likely that
it is very very likely that
reinforcement learning is going to be
reinforcement learning is going to be
essential for long-term AI progress.
essential for long-term AI progress.
Recent use of RL even on LLMs would
Recent use of RL even on LLMs would
suggest I'm right on that. Uh the thing
suggest I'm right on that. Uh the thing
that is yet to be determined is uh
that is yet to be determined is uh
whether we will need like RL of the type
whether we will need like RL of the type
that I'm doing completely separate from
that I'm doing completely separate from
LLMs. I still think it is very likely
LLMs. I still think it is very likely
that we will. And even if I'm wrong
that we will. And even if I'm wrong
there, I think that the type of work I'm
there, I think that the type of work I'm
doing now is a really really effective
doing now is a really really effective
way to develop new general purpose RL
way to develop new general purpose RL
techniques. Um, like I can basically do
techniques. Um, like I can basically do
experiments here that would otherwise
experiments here that would otherwise
require a thousandx the compute because
require a thousandx the compute because
of how fast everything is. It's also
of how fast everything is. It's also
really a great way to just get open
really a great way to just get open
source involvement, right? It's really
source involvement, right? It's really
easy for people to get involved with
easy for people to get involved with
Puffer doing it this
way. Okay.
Um, it goes it goes like this, right?
Um, it goes it goes like this, right?
So, what do we think? Probably
So, what do we think? Probably
normalized four is the most important
metric. We do like maybe
metric. We do like maybe
this normalized score return
this normalized score return
length. I think that's good.
So if I recompile
this, we should see
We should see uh stats
cleanly. Pong doesn't report stats very
cleanly. Pong doesn't report stats very
frequently though. That's the other
frequently though. That's the other
thing I want to do is I want to change
thing I want to do is I want to change
it so we get like consistent
it so we get like consistent
printouts. I don't think I have to
printouts. I don't think I have to
change anything on the M side for that
change anything on the M side for that
though. I think that that's just I have
though. I think that that's just I have
to make it so that when you get stats to
to make it so that when you get stats to
the dashboard, they continue in place
the dashboard, they continue in place
there. Okay. Normalize force for return
there. Okay. Normalize force for return
length and then this N at the
length and then this N at the
bottom doesn't super matter,
right? I could technically just make it
right? I could technically just make it
so that you have to have all these
so that you have to have all these
attributes, right?
And then we don't need any of
this. I think we'll think about that
this. I think we'll think about that
after though. I think we'll do it this
after though. I think we'll do it this
way first. We'll manually define all
way first. We'll manually define all
these different things and then uh later
these different things and then uh later
we'll see whether it makes sense to have
we'll see whether it makes sense to have
like a default log that just does all
like a default log that just does all
this for you. But I think that this will
this for you. But I think that this will
be good for now.
So I think that the only thing that'll
So I think that the only thing that'll
be a little tricky with what I'm doing
be a little tricky with what I'm doing
right now, uh, there are a few
right now, uh, there are a few
environments where it's kind of tough to
environments where it's kind of tough to
think of a normalized score metric.
think of a normalized score metric.
Other than that, this should be pretty
Other than that, this should be pretty
straightforward. So plan is just to jam
straightforward. So plan is just to jam
on this. This will probably take me an
on this. This will probably take me an
hour or two uh, to get all the M's the
hour or two uh, to get all the M's the
way I like them. So happy to answer
way I like them. So happy to answer
random RL questions and stuff. In the
random RL questions and stuff. In the
meantime, we're really trying to start
meantime, we're really trying to start
scaling to more contributors as well. Um
scaling to more contributors as well. Um
I'm looking into acquiring much more
I'm looking into acquiring much more
hardware for essentially to give
hardware for essentially to give
contributors access to like real
contributors access to like real
training compute. Um but I do have to
training compute. Um but I do have to
wait for the tariff prices to come down
wait for the tariff prices to come down
a little bit
first because the machines are expensive
first because the machines are expensive
right now.
Way too many metrics in Enduro. I'd say
Way too many metrics in Enduro. I'd say
I'll chat with like the authors of all
I'll chat with like the authors of all
these ends about like which metrics are
these ends about like which metrics are
actually
actually
useful. There is such a thing as too
useful. There is such a thing as too
many
many
metrics. When you have stuff that's not
metrics. When you have stuff that's not
useful, it's uh if you have a metric
useful, it's uh if you have a metric
that you basically there's no point in
that you basically there's no point in
ever looking at, you're better off not
ever looking at, you're better off not
having it is what I would say.
That's breakout.
Cool.
Um, does it make sense to call it
Um, does it make sense to call it
normalized score when it's not always
normalized score when it's not always
going to
be? Because some of these things like
be? Because some of these things like
this one, right? This score metric is
this one, right? This score metric is
not actually what we're normalizing,
not actually what we're normalizing,
right? The actual metric that matters is
right? The actual metric that matters is
um like days completed or whatever.
Is there a better thing we could call
this? It's a little misleading, right,
this? It's a little misleading, right,
to call it normalized score if it's not
to call it normalized score if it's not
actually based on the score
always. You know
what? Let's see if dumb LLM can come up
what? Let's see if dumb LLM can come up
with random
with random
thing. I have
an score in
an score in
RLM. I want to
RLM. I want to
define 01
define 01
normaliz often but not always.
Don't
want
Perf stat is
Nothing. Perf is good, but Perf is
like, "What do we think about Perf?
performance or just
performance or just
perf. I think that's better, right? Just
perf. I think that's better, right? Just
call it perf.
I try not to spend too long on naming
I try not to spend too long on naming
things,
things,
but sometimes it's useful.
What other
ends?
Okay, that will break if you make that
Okay, that will break if you make that
an int.
I don't know what max score is in blast
are five times player max
lives. So we do
lives. So we do
uh
Let's see what this does.
What did I mess up?
It should be
perfect. I'm thinking what the hard
perfect. I'm thinking what the hard
environments are going to be for this. A
environments are going to be for this. A
lot of the ones that don't have like
lot of the ones that don't have like
clean score have um win rate or
clean score have um win rate or
something that we can use instead.
There are a few like ourware I guess
There are a few like ourware I guess
where it's a little
tricky. Not that hard though.
So they should now have
So they should now have
per
perfect. Yeah. So we can actually make
perfect. Yeah. So we can actually make
it so score doesn't have to be uh a
it so score doesn't have to be uh a
mandatory variable, right? We can make
mandatory variable, right? We can make
it so like if it's win rate, it can just
it so like if it's win rate, it can just
be win rate or
whatever. But we still need two metrics,
whatever. But we still need two metrics,
right? Because one has to be
normalized.
Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah, that's fine.
So blaster
So blaster
breakout fix
car. This does not have a binding
car. This does not have a binding
function.
function.
So,
uh, I guess not all of them are bound
uh, I guess not all of them are bound
yet,
right? Bed is uh working on that for us.
Even stuff as simple as like partful can
Even stuff as simple as like partful can
be really useful frankly like it's just
be really useful frankly like it's just
like a classic task and now we have it.
like a classic task and now we have it.
So you know thanks bet for
that. Ah so this here is not okay. I
that. Ah so this here is not okay. I
forgot that I actually do have to
forgot that I actually do have to
adjust if if we have Syon, I actually do
adjust if if we have Syon, I actually do
have to adjust
this because um yeah, this log here.
Syon will pick up changes and just redo
Syon will pick up changes and just redo
for us. That's
nice. Perf score return and length.
nice. Perf score return and length.
Perfect.
Oops. Uh, connect four.
This does not have
N. Think that does
N. Think that does
it. We have to add this to
Syon. Then Syon just picks it up for
us. We are getting rid of
us. We are getting rid of
Syon but that is working on that.
Syon but that is working on that.
The new binding system is like way
The new binding system is like way
easier than
Syon. I don't hate Syon. It's like nice
Syon. I don't hate Syon. It's like nice
for what it is,
but we kind of just have better
but we kind of just have better
now. I forgot to do anything with perk,
now. I forgot to do anything with perk,
didn't I?
Wait,
Wait,
what?
what?
Uh oh.
There we
are. I don't like that it can be
negative. Does that matter?
It doesn't super matter,
right? Kind of
right? Kind of
does actually.
Oops.
Uh, it's not Fab Zap. What am I
doing? It should just be like
Something like that.
No, that not recompile or
something. Oh, player win.
There we
are. So now per is a different
are. So now per is a different
number and we'll go
number and we'll go
up to
one. Very nice.
So then technically not everything has
So then technically not everything has
to have score right it can have a
to have score right it can have a
different
metric. I can probably put bed on that.
That would be
That would be
good. Okay.
Um, any of these other ones? I think
Um, any of these other ones? I think
Pong would potentially have screwed this
Pong would potentially have screwed this
up, right?
Yeah. Okay. So, I'm a little concerned
Yeah. Okay. So, I'm a little concerned
with
punk because I think uh per is probably
punk because I think uh per is probably
going to be screwy
going to be screwy
here.
here.
Score. Yeah, this can be negative,
Score. Yeah, this can be negative,
right?
So we should just do
something like this,
something like this,
right? And then this will give you
right? And then this will give you
percentage of points one.
long is just really long games. I guess
long is just really long games. I guess
takes a while to
log. There you go.
So, this should hit
So, this should hit
one. We're close to one. Yeah, there it
one. We're close to one. Yeah, there it
is. That's
one. So, breakouts work. Um,
one. So, breakouts work. Um,
Blastar, I think Blastar works. Last bet
Blastar, I think Blastar works. Last bet
on that one. Purple
on that one. Purple
works. Purple
work. That looks good, right?
So, connect four, we just fixed
So, connect four, we just fixed
uh
CPR. I haven't really played with this
CPR. I haven't really played with this
end yet. We got this one submitted in a
end yet. We got this one submitted in a
PR relatively
recently. May as well fix it real quick.
How many agents is it
How many agents is it
per? Is it like three agents per or
per? Is it like three agents per or
something
awkward? Oh, it's eight agents,
right? So, eight agents. We want
right? So, eight agents. We want
uh 4096 total. So, we want 2048 in here.
uh 4096 total. So, we want 2048 in here.
Uh, so divide by 4 is 256, I
believe. Oh, but they put 12 agents in
believe. Oh, but they put 12 agents in
here. Is there a reason it needs to be
here. Is there a reason it needs to be
12? 12 is an awkward number. Can I just
12? 12 is an awkward number. Can I just
do
eight? Okay. What's
eight? Okay. What's
wrong? Seed.
Easy. Okay. So, this gets score and
Easy. Okay. So, this gets score and
moves or
moves or
whatever. We'll just check source.
Uh, this is missing a bunch of stuff.
Um, interest.
This also needs n
Okay. So then this
Okay. So then this
is n logs of
i reward agents.
Uh yeah, this is not how logging should
work. Yeah, this is absolutely not how
work. Yeah, this is absolutely not how
logging should work.
Let me see how logs is
allocated. Logs
Okay. Yeah, this is very
screwy. This is a cool end though. So, I
screwy. This is a cool end though. So, I
would like to have this working.
Oh, here it is. The agents. No, this is
Oh, here it is. The agents. No, this is
fine. We just have to They're just using
fine. We just have to They're just using
the log buffer wrong. Okay, that's
the log buffer wrong. Okay, that's
totally fine. That's a lot easier than
totally fine. That's a lot easier than
what I
thought. It is allocated correctly. It's
thought. It is allocated correctly. It's
just getting used wrong. So, this is
just getting used wrong. So, this is
reset. Reset logs. That's fine.
reset. Reset logs. That's fine.
Uh reward agents
near. This is fine. This is
not. This is fine. This is fine.
That's crazy that he got a seating issue
That's crazy that he got a seating issue
with the card.
I guess the end doesn't reset or
I guess the end doesn't reset or
whatever. Oh, so he gives it reward when
whatever. Oh, so he gives it reward when
uh the agent gets
uh the agent gets
food
because cuz the end never resets,
because cuz the end never resets,
right? Okay, hang on. That is
different. How are we going to do that?
because I can define a score and a
because I can define a score and a
reward with that. But how do we define
reward with that. But how do we define
perf? It's the same problem as Rword,
perf? It's the same problem as Rword,
right?
right?
You want like minimum time to get food,
You want like minimum time to get food,
but it's um
That's slightly
That's slightly
obnoxious. I guess if we look at all the
obnoxious. I guess if we look at all the
ends that we have,
right? So, blaster these ones you can
right? So, blaster these ones you can
just normalize reward go is win rate.
just normalize reward go is win rate.
Grid is win rate. Mo is win rate. Neural
Grid is win rate. Mo is win rate. Neural
MMO 3 has a rough max score. Hong has a
MMO 3 has a rough max score. Hong has a
max score. This one's not done. This
max score. This one's not done. This
one's not done. Owware is the same
one's not done. Owware is the same
problem as this
problem as this
one. Uh,
one. Uh,
Snake. Snake's kind of hard, but we can
Snake. Snake's kind of hard, but we can
kind of just arbitrarily define a max
kind of just arbitrarily define a max
score. Squared as a max score. This
score. Squared as a max score. This
one's not done. This one's not done.
one's not done. This one's not done.
This one has the win
This one has the win
rate. Uh, this one has the exact same
rate. Uh, this one has the exact same
problem and this one has So, okay. So,
problem and this one has So, okay. So,
the only one that we have, we have three
the only one that we have, we have three
problem M's and they all have the issue
problem M's and they all have the issue
that the reward is
that the reward is
basically go get the thing and how well
basically go get the thing and how well
you're doing is how quickly do you get
you're doing is how quickly do you get
the
the
thing, right?
How do we handle
that? I mean, one thing we could do is
that? I mean, one thing we could do is
just like
estimate a minimum
estimate a minimum
time. That's not
amazing. That would be the punt though,
amazing. That would be the punt though,
right? Is we just like guess a minimum
right? Is we just like guess a minimum
amount of time.
How would I do this on like snake for
instance? You really don't know what the
instance? You really don't know what the
max score is, right?
I think we punt on it for now. We just
I think we punt on it for now. We just
like pick them. We just pick
one. Okay. So, they were actually
one. Okay. So, they were actually
correct then in these the way that
correct then in these the way that
they're logging here.
they're logging here.
So
So
um then we
um then we
do add
do add
log and then this is also what add log
All
right.
Okay. So now score is
one and then perf will just
be I guess one over the episode length
be I guess one over the episode length
is the really easy one, right?
But that's going to be like a stupidly
But that's going to be like a stupidly
no low
I could do it that way for now. To be
I could do it that way for now. To be
honest,
I don't like it that way
I don't like it that way
though. What is a good score function?
though. What is a good score function?
Damn it.
It could just be one minus a fraction of
It could just be one minus a fraction of
the episode length. That's better, isn't
the episode length. That's better, isn't
it?
Yeah, let's do it that way.
That's a pretty good one, right?
Yeah, that's pretty good. That'll like
Yeah, that's pretty good. That'll like
produce a reasonable curve, I
think. Let me try
think. Let me try
this. And uh we have to collect. Let's
this. And uh we have to collect. Let's
have Syon,
right? Yeah, let's have Syon.
Okay. And then this actually gets worse
Okay. And then this actually gets worse
over time, but it's because of uh the M
over time, but it's because of uh the M
dynamics. Well, I think this will work
dynamics. Well, I think this will work
generally and this should produce
generally and this should produce
something clean for like hardware and
something clean for like hardware and
other
other
stuff. Uh did we do go? I don't think we
stuff. Uh did we do go? I don't think we
did go yet correctly. We were really
did go yet correctly. We were really
close to doing go.
Yeah. So, this wants we want to put
Yeah. So, this wants we want to put
this
this
here. Don't need win rate.
And actually this fits perfectly.
The heck happened here, man? Man,
Um. Oh, this is just log buffer
things.
things.
Yep. It's this
This is kind of just doing
This is kind of just doing
like environment janitor work, but it's
chill. And this actually like
chill. And this actually like
meaningfully improves the uh usability
meaningfully improves the uh usability
of puffer as
of puffer as
well. So, it's quite good.
Is this not winning? Hang
on. Well, we know it isn't winning
on. Well, we know it isn't winning
though, right?
30% of
30% of
games. Oh, did go kind of just start
games. Oh, did go kind of just start
working. Yes, it
working. Yes, it
did.
did.
Cool. Good to know.
uh grid. We have to come back
to we have episode return episode
to we have episode return episode
length. We need
score and we need
um we need perf
So perf is going to be radiant radiant
victory. We'll do this in towers alive
victory. We'll do this in towers alive
or
or
whatever. And this is still Syon, I
whatever. And this is still Syon, I
believe.
believe.
So, this is going to need to have purple
So, this is going to need to have purple
and score
added like
so. Uh, no attribute per really.
Oh, [ __ ] You put it in the wrong
Oh, [ __ ] You put it in the wrong
one. Go here.
And now we can train
Moa. Uh, we know what that is.
This
one. This should be good. This should be
one. This should be good. This should be
very good.
It does annoy me that it takes so long
It does annoy me that it takes so long
to log, but it takes a while to finish
to log, but it takes a while to finish
the games, I
believe.
believe.
Yep. So, here you
Yep. So, here you
are. That is win rate.
are. That is win rate.
This tower is
This tower is
alive and then episode return uh not
alive and then episode return uh not
being anything is kind of
awkward. We'll have to fix that.
Confused how
Confused how
this does stuff.
Aggregate and
clear. How does this aggregated stuff
do do anything?
Okay. Well, this will be part of the
Okay. Well, this will be part of the
binding change, I assume. We'll uh we'll
binding change, I assume. We'll uh we'll
leave it like this for
leave it like this for
now. Don't want to spend too much time
now. Don't want to spend too much time
on any one
ends. Then neural MO 3. My
favorite still has old. Oh, it has new
favorite still has old. Oh, it has new
login. We already I already did that.
login. We already I already did that.
Okay. So, this needs
glo. So, return episode
length score is min
compro equals
divided
divided
by Is there a max
level
Right. I guess we have
tiers into
levels. It should be
levels. So, we'll do float and levels
levels. So, we'll do float and levels
like this.
And we're not even really going to be
And we're not even really going to be
able to see this do much of anything
able to see this do much of anything
because
because
um it uh takes forever to
train because it's
train because it's
hard. But we should at least be able to
hard. But we should at least be able to
see our logs.
And hopefully they're
correct. Oh, lovely. We don't get uh
correct. Oh, lovely. We don't get uh
agent steps
now. Uh so we want two
now. Uh so we want two
ends. I should probably put a
ends. I should probably put a
note in fifth for now because of
Uh, I'm not seeing my
logs. I forgot to do this.
Okay. So score shouldn't be one. Oh no,
Okay. So score shouldn't be one. Oh no,
it should be
one. Yeah, that's
one. Yeah, that's
fine because min com prop is going to be
fine because min com prop is going to be
one and this will be
one and this will be
0.025. We're good with that.
So that's neural m3. We already did
So that's neural m3. We already did
pong. Roboc's not done. Rocket lender is
pong. Roboc's not done. Rocket lender is
not done.
Rareware.
Rareware. This has return
Rareware. This has return
length curves.
Okay.
So this will work.
So this will work.
Hopefully there'll be
something. And we also need to modify
something. And we also need to modify
Syon real quick.
Yep.
Okay. So perf will be

There we are.

That probably does something right.

I wonder if this starts going down over

roughly almost 5
hours to just hammer

uh and experiments. I think that the
major goal right now is going to be to

get all or as many as possible of the Ms
get all or as many as possible of the Ms
to have a single score metric that is
to have a single score metric that is
normalized from 0 to one. Um to get
normalized from 0 to one. Um to get
reasonable defaults for all the

experimenting. And uh yeah, this should
experimenting. And uh yeah, this should
put us in a pretty good spot for
put us in a pretty good spot for
tomorrow. Um because if we get all this
tomorrow. Um because if we get all this
done then I will be very well set up to
done then I will be very well set up to
do either experiment side stuff or like
do either experiment side stuff or like
new algorithm stuff. Usually I try to
new algorithm stuff. Usually I try to
make Saturday like a long like deep dive
make Saturday like a long like deep dive
algorithm day or whatever or deep dive
algorithm day or whatever or deep dive
edge day. So this should set us up
edge day. So this should set us up
pretty well for that. Um because there
pretty well for that. Um because there
is one bug right now that I'm pretty

that we're going to have to fix before

should help with that.
Okay, so let's get started with
Okay, so let's get started with
it. I believe we have Enduro working.

Yes, this has normalized score. Uh the
Yes, this has normalized score. Uh the
one thing that I would like to do if I
one thing that I would like to do if I
could is reorder these so that they show

it is very very likely that

Recent use of RL even on LLMs would

suggest I'm right on that. Uh the thing
suggest I'm right on that. Uh the thing
that is yet to be determined is uh
that is yet to be determined is uh
whether we will need like RL of the type
whether we will need like RL of the type
that I'm doing completely separate from

LLMs. I still think it is very likely
LLMs. I still think it is very likely
that we will. And even if I'm wrong
that we will. And even if I'm wrong
there, I think that the type of work I'm
there, I think that the type of work I'm
doing now is a really really effective
doing now is a really really effective
way to develop new general purpose RL
way to develop new general purpose RL
techniques. Um, like I can basically do

experiments here that would otherwise
experiments here that would otherwise
require a thousandx the compute because
require a thousandx the compute because
of how fast everything is. It's also
of how fast everything is. It's also
really a great way to just get open
really a great way to just get open
source involvement, right? It's really
source involvement, right? It's really
easy for people to get involved with
easy for people to get involved with
Puffer doing it this
way. Okay.
Um, it goes it goes like this, right?
Um, it goes it goes like this, right?
So, what do we think? Probably
So, what do we think? Probably
normalized four is the most important
metric. We do like maybe
metric. We do like maybe
this normalized score return
this normalized score return
length. I think that's good.
So if I recompile
this, we should see
We should see uh stats
cleanly. Pong doesn't report stats very
cleanly. Pong doesn't report stats very
frequently though. That's the other
frequently though. That's the other
thing I want to do is I want to change
thing I want to do is I want to change
it so we get like consistent
it so we get like consistent
printouts. I don't think I have to
printouts. I don't think I have to
change anything on the M side for that
change anything on the M side for that
though. I think that that's just I have
though. I think that that's just I have
to make it so that when you get stats to
to make it so that when you get stats to
the dashboard, they continue in place
the dashboard, they continue in place
there. Okay. Normalize force for return
there. Okay. Normalize force for return
length and then this N at the
length and then this N at the
bottom doesn't super matter,
right? I could technically just make it
right? I could technically just make it
so that you have to have all these
so that you have to have all these
attributes, right?
And then we don't need any of
this. I think we'll think about that
this. I think we'll think about that
after though. I think we'll do it this
after though. I think we'll do it this
way first. We'll manually define all
way first. We'll manually define all
these different things and then uh later
these different things and then uh later
we'll see whether it makes sense to have
we'll see whether it makes sense to have
like a default log that just does all
like a default log that just does all
this for you. But I think that this will
this for you. But I think that this will
be good for now.
So I think that the only thing that'll
So I think that the only thing that'll
be a little tricky with what I'm doing
be a little tricky with what I'm doing
right now, uh, there are a few
right now, uh, there are a few
environments where it's kind of tough to
environments where it's kind of tough to
think of a normalized score metric.
think of a normalized score metric.
Other than that, this should be pretty
Other than that, this should be pretty
straightforward. So plan is just to jam
straightforward. So plan is just to jam
on this. This will probably take me an
on this. This will probably take me an
hour or two uh, to get all the M's the
hour or two uh, to get all the M's the
way I like them. So happy to answer
way I like them. So happy to answer
random RL questions and stuff. In the
random RL questions and stuff. In the
meantime, we're really trying to start

scaling to more contributors as well. Um
I'm looking into acquiring much more
I'm looking into acquiring much more

Way too many metrics in Enduro. I'd say
Way too many metrics in Enduro. I'd say
I'll chat with like the authors of all
I'll chat with like the authors of all
these ends about like which metrics are
these ends about like which metrics are
actually
actually
useful. There is such a thing as too
useful. There is such a thing as too
many
many
metrics. When you have stuff that's not
metrics. When you have stuff that's not
useful, it's uh if you have a metric
useful, it's uh if you have a metric
that you basically there's no point in
that you basically there's no point in
ever looking at, you're better off not
ever looking at, you're better off not
having it is what I would say.
That's breakout.
Cool.
Um, does it make sense to call it
Um, does it make sense to call it
normalized score when it's not always
normalized score when it's not always
going to
be? Because some of these things like
be? Because some of these things like
this one, right? This score metric is
this one, right? This score metric is
not actually what we're normalizing,
not actually what we're normalizing,
right? The actual metric that matters is
right? The actual metric that matters is
um like days completed or whatever.
Is there a better thing we could call
this? It's a little misleading, right,
this? It's a little misleading, right,
to call it normalized score if it's not
to call it normalized score if it's not
actually based on the score
always. You know
what? Let's see if dumb LLM can come up
what? Let's see if dumb LLM can come up
with random

normaliz often but not always.
Don't

Perf stat is
Nothing. Perf is good, but Perf is
like, "What do we think about Perf?
performance or just

call it perf.
I try not to spend too long on naming

but sometimes it's useful.
What other
ends?
Okay, that will break if you make that
Okay, that will break if you make that
an int.
I don't know what max score is in blast
are five times player max
lives. So we do
lives. So we do
uh
Let's see what this does.
What did I mess up?
It should be
perfect. I'm thinking what the hard
perfect. I'm thinking what the hard
environments are going to be for this. A
environments are going to be for this. A
lot of the ones that don't have like
lot of the ones that don't have like
clean score have um win rate or
clean score have um win rate or
something that we can use instead.
There are a few like ourware I guess
There are a few like ourware I guess
where it's a little
tricky. Not that hard though.
So they should now have
So they should now have
per
perfect. Yeah. So we can actually make
perfect. Yeah. So we can actually make
it so score doesn't have to be uh a
it so score doesn't have to be uh a
mandatory variable, right? We can make
mandatory variable, right? We can make
it so like if it's win rate, it can just
it so like if it's win rate, it can just
be win rate or
whatever. But we still need two metrics,
whatever. But we still need two metrics,
right? Because one has to be
normalized.
Yeah, that's fine.
Yeah, that's fine.
So blaster
So blaster

So,
uh, I guess not all of them are bound

yet,
right? Bed is uh working on that for us.
Even stuff as simple as like partful can
Even stuff as simple as like partful can
be really useful frankly like it's just
be really useful frankly like it's just
like a classic task and now we have it.
like a classic task and now we have it.
So you know thanks bet for
that. Ah so this here is not okay. I
that. Ah so this here is not okay. I
forgot that I actually do have to
forgot that I actually do have to
adjust if if we have Syon, I actually do
adjust if if we have Syon, I actually do
have to adjust
this because um yeah, this log here.
Syon will pick up changes and just redo
Syon will pick up changes and just redo
for us. That's
nice. Perf score return and length.
nice. Perf score return and length.
Perfect.
Oops. Uh, connect four.
This does not have
N. Think that does
N. Think that does
it. We have to add this to
Syon. Then Syon just picks it up for
us. We are getting rid of
us. We are getting rid of
Syon but that is working on that.
Syon but that is working on that.
The new binding system is like way
The new binding system is like way
easier than
Syon. I don't hate Syon. It's like nice
Syon. I don't hate Syon. It's like nice
for what it is,
but we kind of just have better
but we kind of just have better
now. I forgot to do anything with perk,
now. I forgot to do anything with perk,
didn't I?
Wait,
Wait,
what?
what?
Uh oh.
There we
are. I don't like that it can be
negative. Does that matter?
It doesn't super matter,
right? Kind of
right? Kind of
does actually.
Oops.
Uh, it's not Fab Zap. What am I
doing? It should just be like
Something like that.
No, that not recompile or
something. Oh, player win.
There we
are. So now per is a different
are. So now per is a different
number and we'll go
number and we'll go
up to

So then technically not everything has
So then technically not everything has
to have score right it can have a
to have score right it can have a
different
metric. I can probably put bed on that.
That would be
That would be
good. Okay.
Um, any of these other ones? I think
Um, any of these other ones? I think
Pong would potentially have screwed this
Pong would potentially have screwed this
up, right?
Yeah. Okay. So, I'm a little concerned
Yeah. Okay. So, I'm a little concerned
with
punk because I think uh per is probably
punk because I think uh per is probably
going to be screwy
going to be screwy
here.
here.
Score. Yeah, this can be negative,
Score. Yeah, this can be negative,
right?
So we should just do
something like this,
something like this,
right? And then this will give you
right? And then this will give you
percentage of points one.
long is just really long games. I guess
long is just really long games. I guess
takes a while to
log. There you go.
So, this should hit
So, this should hit
one. We're close to one. Yeah, there it
one. We're close to one. Yeah, there it
is. That's
one. So, breakouts work. Um,
one. So, breakouts work. Um,
Blastar, I think Blastar works. Last bet
Blastar, I think Blastar works. Last bet
on that one. Purple
on that one. Purple
works. Purple
work. That looks good, right?
So, connect four, we just fixed
So, connect four, we just fixed
uh
CPR. I haven't really played with this
CPR. I haven't really played with this
end yet. We got this one submitted in a

PR relatively
recently. May as well fix it real quick.
How many agents is it
How many agents is it
per? Is it like three agents per or
per? Is it like three agents per or
something
awkward? Oh, it's eight agents,
right? So, eight agents. We want
right? So, eight agents. We want
uh 4096 total. So, we want 2048 in here.
uh 4096 total. So, we want 2048 in here.
Uh, so divide by 4 is 256, I
believe. Oh, but they put 12 agents in
believe. Oh, but they put 12 agents in
here. Is there a reason it needs to be
here. Is there a reason it needs to be
12? 12 is an awkward number. Can I just
12? 12 is an awkward number. Can I just
do
eight? Okay. What's
eight? Okay. What's
wrong? Seed.
Easy. Okay. So, this gets score and
Easy. Okay. So, this gets score and
moves or
moves or
whatever. We'll just check source.
Uh, this is missing a bunch of stuff.
Um, interest.
This also needs n
Okay. So then this
Okay. So then this
is n logs of
i reward agents.
Uh yeah, this is not how logging should
work. Yeah, this is absolutely not how
work. Yeah, this is absolutely not how
logging should work.
Let me see how logs is
allocated. Logs
Okay. Yeah, this is very
screwy. This is a cool end though. So, I
screwy. This is a cool end though. So, I
would like to have this working.
Oh, here it is. The agents. No, this is
Oh, here it is. The agents. No, this is
fine. We just have to They're just using
fine. We just have to They're just using
the log buffer wrong. Okay, that's
the log buffer wrong. Okay, that's
totally fine. That's a lot easier than
totally fine. That's a lot easier than
what I
thought. It is allocated correctly. It's
thought. It is allocated correctly. It's
just getting used wrong. So, this is
just getting used wrong. So, this is
reset. Reset logs. That's fine.
reset. Reset logs. That's fine.
Uh reward agents
near. This is fine. This is
not. This is fine. This is fine.
That's crazy that he got a seating issue
That's crazy that he got a seating issue
with the card.
I guess the end doesn't reset or
I guess the end doesn't reset or
whatever. Oh, so he gives it reward when
whatever. Oh, so he gives it reward when
uh the agent gets
uh the agent gets
food
because cuz the end never resets,
because cuz the end never resets,
right? Okay, hang on. That is
different. How are we going to do that?
because I can define a score and a
because I can define a score and a
reward with that. But how do we define
reward with that. But how do we define
perf? It's the same problem as Rword,
perf? It's the same problem as Rword,
right?
right?
You want like minimum time to get food,
You want like minimum time to get food,
but it's um
That's slightly
That's slightly
obnoxious. I guess if we look at all the
obnoxious. I guess if we look at all the
ends that we have,
right? So, blaster these ones you can
right? So, blaster these ones you can
just normalize reward go is win rate.
just normalize reward go is win rate.
Grid is win rate. Mo is win rate. Neural
Grid is win rate. Mo is win rate. Neural
MMO 3 has a rough max score. Hong has a

Snake. Snake's kind of hard, but we can
Snake. Snake's kind of hard, but we can
kind of just arbitrarily define a max
kind of just arbitrarily define a max

one's not done. This one's not done.
This one has the win
This one has the win
rate. Uh, this one has the exact same
rate. Uh, this one has the exact same
problem and this one has So, okay. So,
problem and this one has So, okay. So,
the only one that we have, we have three
the only one that we have, we have three
problem M's and they all have the issue
problem M's and they all have the issue
that the reward is
that the reward is
basically go get the thing and how well
basically go get the thing and how well
you're doing is how quickly do you get
you're doing is how quickly do you get
the
the
thing, right?
How do we handle
that? I mean, one thing we could do is
that? I mean, one thing we could do is
just like
estimate a minimum
estimate a minimum
time. That's not
amazing. That would be the punt though,
amazing. That would be the punt though,
right? Is we just like guess a minimum
right? Is we just like guess a minimum
amount of time.
How would I do this on like snake for
instance? You really don't know what the
instance? You really don't know what the
max score is, right?
I think we punt on it for now. We just
I think we punt on it for now. We just
like pick them. We just pick
one. Okay. So, they were actually
one. Okay. So, they were actually
correct then in these the way that
correct then in these the way that
they're logging here.
they're logging here.
So
So
um then we
um then we
do add
do add
log and then this is also what add log
All
right.
Okay. So now score is
one and then perf will just
be I guess one over the episode length
be I guess one over the episode length
is the really easy one, right?
But that's going to be like a stupidly
But that's going to be like a stupidly
no low
I could do it that way for now. To be
I could do it that way for now. To be
honest,
I don't like it that way
I don't like it that way
though. What is a good score function?
though. What is a good score function?
Damn it.
It could just be one minus a fraction of
It could just be one minus a fraction of
the episode length. That's better, isn't
the episode length. That's better, isn't
it?
Yeah, let's do it that way.
That's a pretty good one, right?
Yeah, that's pretty good. That'll like
Yeah, that's pretty good. That'll like
produce a reasonable curve, I
think. Let me try
think. Let me try
this. And uh we have to collect. Let's
this. And uh we have to collect. Let's
have Syon,
right? Yeah, let's have Syon.
Okay. And then this actually gets worse
Okay. And then this actually gets worse
over time, but it's because of uh the M
over time, but it's because of uh the M
dynamics. Well, I think this will work
dynamics. Well, I think this will work
generally and this should produce
generally and this should produce
something clean for like hardware and
something clean for like hardware and
other
other
stuff. Uh did we do go? I don't think we
stuff. Uh did we do go? I don't think we
did go yet correctly. We were really
did go yet correctly. We were really
close to doing go.
Yeah. So, this wants we want to put
Yeah. So, this wants we want to put
this
this
here. Don't need win rate.
And actually this fits perfectly.
The heck happened here, man? Man,
Um. Oh, this is just log buffer
things.
things.
Yep. It's this
This is kind of just doing
This is kind of just doing
like environment janitor work, but it's
chill. And this actually like
chill. And this actually like
meaningfully improves the uh usability
meaningfully improves the uh usability
of puffer as
of puffer as
well. So, it's quite good.
Is this not winning? Hang
on. Well, we know it isn't winning
on. Well, we know it isn't winning
though, right?
30% of

Cool. Good to know.
uh grid. We have to come back
to we have episode return episode
to we have episode return episode

So perf is going to be radiant radiant

whatever. And this is still Syon, I
believe.

So, this is going to need to have purple
So, this is going to need to have purple

added like
so. Uh, no attribute per really.
Oh, [ __ ] You put it in the wrong
Oh, [ __ ] You put it in the wrong

And now we can train
Moa. Uh, we know what that is.
This
one. This should be good. This should be

very good.
It does annoy me that it takes so long
It does annoy me that it takes so long
to log, but it takes a while to finish
to log, but it takes a while to finish
