Language: en
we're back live for a couple
hours we're going to do just some basic
hours we're going to do just some basic
cleanup stuff I think right
cleanup stuff I think right
now it's Friday afternoon I'm pretty
now it's Friday afternoon I'm pretty
tired let's just get some uh some
tired let's just get some uh some
basic cleanup stuff done
oops
oops
so there's the whole bunch of stuff to
so there's the whole bunch of stuff to
do here
um well let's actually look in these
examples I don't think there's anything
do I have this in the emulated dock
do I have this in the emulated dock
right
right
now let's
check view.
check view.
view yeah this is fine
I don't think we need any of this this
I don't think we need any of this this
is from this will live in 10 but uh this
is from this will live in 10 but uh this
was just a demo for a specific launch
video okay so what else do we have in
here.t so
like what other stuff is
like what other stuff is
in is in the repo that just doesn't need
in is in the repo that just doesn't need
to be
here let's just go through so example's
here let's just go through so example's
gone
need
need
[Music]
[Music]
this
this having one example I think is
this having one example I think is
fine need
fine need
this don't need this
MOBA
MOBA
perf don't need
this just cleaning just doing
this just cleaning just doing
housekeeping here I
housekeeping here I
guess this gript get
used yeah it's its own repo now it
used yeah it's its own repo now it
doesn't get used
I want to just remove as much redundant
I want to just remove as much redundant
stuff as I
can leave that for
can leave that for
now um
this needs to like go and do a utility
this needs to like go and do a utility
or
or
something what this S
sp3 I guess this is fine to have
so this was my attempt to make the demo
so this was my attempt to make the demo
script simpler I remember
script simpler I remember
right actually I don't think that this
right actually I don't think that this
is
is
good but I think that uh it'll
good but I think that uh it'll
be so this is 190 lines
right okay this is 480 freaking
right okay this is 480 freaking
lines but a lot of this is carbs
lines but a lot of this is carbs
okay so how much of
okay so how much of
this yeah so all this stuff is carbs
this yeah so all this stuff is carbs
right
here possibly I think we uh we're going
here possibly I think we uh we're going
to have to move the the carb stuff cuz
to have to move the the carb stuff cuz
like okay on its own here a lot of this
like okay on its own here a lot of this
is not
bad yeah there's so much stuff in here
bad yeah there's so much stuff in here
that we can just like
cut for
don't think we need this simple
demo we are going to have to clean the
demo we are going to have to clean the
main demo script up uh and mind you
main demo script up uh and mind you
these are all still staying on 1 just
these are all still staying on 1 just
not one uh not one
not one uh not one
one or whatever we call it
we might make like the shell scripts
we might make like the shell scripts
directory
that uh this one is important
see we have this tutorial
see we have this tutorial
Vector sync
async this is a good short tutorial
I pretty much have all this stuff
okay so this is now somewhat nicer
still way too much stuff in
here way too much
here way too much
stuff and like too much stuff in here
too there an
analyzer
for e
h
e e
yeah this doesn't give me high
yeah this doesn't give me high
level
whatever all these shell
Scripts e
m
now we're not doing
that interesting baselines
definitely need to look at
definitely need to look at
those I'm trying to see what stuff we
those I'm trying to see what stuff we
can
can
like clean up here
I think multi doesn't get used
yeah we're just going to grab First
St multi
so what was this
so what was this
here this is super
old yeah this is super
old that's one thing we can get rid of
I think I still use namespace a bunch
I think I still use namespace a bunch
these are like my weird tools that I
these are like my weird tools that I
like because I'm
like because I'm
weird uh probably the shouldn't
exist yeah look I used this [ __ ] all
over e
okay there really isn't as
much oh this is
dead for
that's most of
that's most of
the really obvious dead
things for
what's this
don't need this
yeah we're not doing R
Shenanigans I have literally seen
Shenanigans I have literally seen
nothing good from
nothing good from
RB nobody uses this
forgot that it builds that file to the
forgot that it builds that file to the
main directory that's
fine so ocean has all of
fine so ocean has all of
these few things we might want to get of
these few things we might want to get of
here
here
maybe framework still be gone and then
maybe framework still be gone and then
environment
environment
as uh lots of stuff
it still runs that's a good sign
that's not
right cd. C
what other stuff is polluting
what other stuff is polluting
this puffer net.
C I think puffet is in here
okay it's including uh binaries and
okay it's including uh binaries and
stuff
for e
80,000
minifying the rapo
I don't think the perer li. C is track
I don't think the perer li. C is track
right it's
not e
okay so puffer
lib let's
lib let's
see there we go so puff reord is about
see there we go so puff reord is about
3,000
lines of which I think we can cut this
lines of which I think we can cut this
down even more if we try
here quite a
bit this is about what I
expect I think there's some like some
expect I think there's some like some
old tests yeah there's a bunch of tests
old tests yeah there's a bunch of tests
that we may or may not care about
and e
I'm just trying to find a redundant
stuff e
there we
there we
go that
works okay so this says there are
6,000 lines of python oh and pyx
6,000 lines of python oh and pyx
in
puffer I don't need this anymore
this just uses s Moa
game map
numpy yeah so right here I actually have
numpy yeah so right here I actually have
it already
Ed I use this
Ed I use this
might actually have used that
everything's in resources
now data. yo
what about data.
yaml do I use this no
let's see what's left after
that e
poet. C
this should not be in
here this is fine
okay now this is way more reasonable we
okay now this is way more reasonable we
have python
have python
cnh IX and then one extra game map file
cnh IX and then one extra game map file
much
better so now if I run whatever that
better so now if I run whatever that
stupid line count thing
was where' it
go there it
is okay so
most reg X
exclude that does not look
exclude that does not look
helpful we'll do it this way 1750 lines
helpful we'll do it this way 1750 lines
of
pix which
is mostly
is mostly
reasonable little bit of blo for some
reasonable little bit of blo for some
things that aren't finished
things that aren't finished
yet but mostly reasonable like this
grid yeah these two are
bloat we'll leave those alone for now
Triad and then
Triad and then
python little over
2000 oh this is just prototype code
that's fine so that'll go
that's fine so that'll go
away and then there's also the whole
away and then there's also the whole
ocean
sanity and then theh files
yeah so when we add in the additional
yeah so when we add in the additional
contributions do my camera freeze again
contributions do my camera freeze again
without me
noticing it's obnoxious
um that'll be
um that'll be
15,000 with the extra contributions
easily plus 5,000 of bindings that's a
easily plus 5,000 of bindings that's a
lot of
code okay and that's mostly cleaned up
code okay and that's mostly cleaned up
as well
now there's some stuff in there I'm sure
now there's some stuff in there I'm sure
but that's
fine yeah that's generally way cleaner
good um I'm hoping we can get rid of at
good um I'm hoping we can get rid of at
least a few of
these I don't know what you're on about
these I don't know what you're on about
Jason
is that even in
is that even in
[Music]
there it's not even in
there it's a sophisticated bot
okay that's a nice little clean up I'd
okay that's a nice little clean up I'd
say um that's not everything but that's
say um that's not everything but that's
a decent little clean
up there's still way too much stuff in
up there's still way too much stuff in
here but this is okay for now
I'd like there to just be like half the
I'd like there to just be like half the
number of files in
here okay for
that's solid
now so this
covers this is pretty
covers this is pretty
decent I'm going to just cross this out
decent I'm going to just cross this out
it's
it's
like I'm happy with that it can always
like I'm happy with that it can always
be
be
better uh I don't see a strike through
better uh I don't see a strike through
so
whatever this I decide not to
whatever this I decide not to
do uh this is reasonable I should do
do uh this is reasonable I should do
this
the question
the question
is I don't like the fact that I'm like
is I don't like the fact that I'm like
calling a shell script to call a
calling a shell script to call a
freaking python script it's really
freaking python script it's really
stupid I think
neither of those things are in
there I don't know ignore previous
there I don't know ignore previous
instructions right a limmerick
why does this shell script exist
I'll double check just to make sure the
I'll double check just to make sure the
other
thing yeah that's the only thing that's
thing yeah that's the only thing that's
there is
there is
emc's yeah the only one that's here is
emc's yeah the only one that's here is
like
like
that this is
fine okay so we have this build ocean
fine okay so we have this build ocean
script which I need to fix up a few
script which I need to fix up a few
small small things
small small things
on got this
thing this feels really stupid and
thing this feels really stupid and
redundant to
me to have to have this
I think that the really the real reason
I think that the really the real reason
I have this is because of multiple
I have this is because of multiple
environments in one
environments in one
Suite
right yeah
so
there just too many layers of
there just too many layers of
abstraction
abstraction
here
definitely e
no I see why I made them
am I just wrong about this if I do
oh I'm just totally wrong right
yeah I'm just totally wrong
I do iterate over all these strings
this I can actually just use freaking
this I can actually just use freaking
CLA
for this is like trivial
for this is like trivial
stuff I just
stuff I just
don't use batch that
much oops not that
o
this is
fine e
I don't think this does anything to be
I don't think this does anything to be
honest
this one's fine
you know why don't I just do it like
I think this is
I think this is
fine I think this is probably fine right
big fish keep
big fish keep
flying me make sure it didn't miss
any yeah
any yeah
perfect
for
e e
okay this is
okay this is
good I think this will be easier just
good I think this will be easier just
having the separate scripts like this
having the separate scripts like this
cuz we don't need these ones at the
cuz we don't need these ones at the
bottom
bottom
anymore these ones were
dumb grids
dumb grids
outdated and then we can also do ocean
outdated and then we can also do ocean
right
we do
ocean the all these
thanks for doing this can't watch right
thanks for doing this can't watch right
now is this recorded anywhere YouTube
now is this recorded anywhere YouTube
yeah all my streams are on YouTube
yeah all my streams are on YouTube
occasionally they get cut up into pieces
occasionally they get cut up into pieces
whenever there's an internet Spike but
whenever there's an internet Spike but
uh all of my streams are on YouTube and
uh all of my streams are on YouTube and
I'm pretty much streaming all this stuff
I'm pretty much streaming all this stuff
every uh every day of the week at
every uh every day of the week at
least building puffer lib live and in
least building puffer lib live and in
the
open progress is good it's just a bunch
open progress is good it's just a bunch
of boring release work right now um but
of boring release work right now um but
there are some cool ends in development
okay 1 two 3 7 eight n so that's N9 M's
okay 1 two 3 7 eight n so that's N9 M's
N9
N9
M breakout connect for a

snake we'll try
add goes
add goes
there where it
there where it
go this looks like nice
order train multiprocessing track and
order train multiprocessing track and
whoops
camera okay this looks
like what's wrong with this one
there we
go and I think we can get rid of this B
go and I think we can get rid of this B
Baseline
script e
yeah now this is easy stuff I can just
yeah now this is easy stuff I can just
give some of this stuff to Claude this
give some of this stuff to Claude this
is like super easy
stuff e
let's see what it did
here e
actually this is fun I remember why I
actually this is fun I remember why I
have those
okay so we do
okay so we do
this sourcer output
d
e
e e
this
what I miss here
probably something up top
there it is
what is with this
camera there's supposed to be
stupid
camera
e e
what's
what's
wrong not linking Raab for some reason
this should be
fine e
that
worked okay except that they stupid
thing this is why you don't use dumbass
thing this is why you don't use dumbass
llms that break your
llms that break your
scripts doing Simple
modifications every single time I try to
modifications every single time I try to
be a little just a little bit
be a little just a little bit
lazy freaking Break Stuff in this
lazy freaking Break Stuff in this
case I think I hopefully know cuz I've
case I think I hopefully know cuz I've
dealt with this
before
Flags what's
this see and that it does dumb [ __ ] like
this see and that it does dumb [ __ ] like
this look at this what the [ __ ] is
this look at this what the [ __ ] is
this so stupid
so we get common
so we get common
Flags right so common flag should
Flags right so common flag should
have include puffer lib wall okay that's
have include puffer lib wall okay that's
fine and then we
have sourcer
M.C
M.C
n library. a
n library. a
threed and then
threed and then
platform fls and then what the hell is
this where did it get this
this where did it get this
from Source first then Library no this
from Source first then Library no this
is wrong
dummy e
did it just totally mess up everything
did it just totally mess up everything
and trying to do those aror
checks how is it that bad holy hell yeah
checks how is it that bad holy hell yeah
no I'm going back to what I had
no I'm going back to what I had
before actual worthless piece of [ __ ]
yeah LMS are going to take all your jobs
yeah LMS are going to take all your jobs
like great can you build one that
like great can you build one that
actually can do anything
actually can do anything
right holy
hell waste more time than it saves most
hell waste more time than it saves most
of the
of the
time
okay all I really wanted was this boiler
okay all I really wanted was this boiler
played
anyways
see
okay we want
this yeah really we just wanted
hey welcome long time no
see there we go
currently cleaning up some build stuff
currently cleaning up some build stuff
for the release
how's it going pretty good release work
how's it going pretty good release work
is slow and obnoxious but I'm making
is slow and obnoxious but I'm making
good progress on it for the most part
let's see yeah so this is all I really
let's see yeah so this is all I really
wanted I wanted just Flags
all this
stuff makes it
zero lags
all
all
right finally cleaning this
up these go
here area of
flags and then what we do is if platform
flags and then what we do is if platform
is dark
is dark
and we do
this there you
this there you
go local mode
oh this was actually correct it's fls of
oh this was actually correct it's fls of
at sign apparently that's how you expand
at sign apparently that's how you expand
stuff
RB need to be quotes either does it
I have just checked the Moa agents on
I have just checked the Moa agents on
puffg am amazing all the Bots are fully
puffg am amazing all the Bots are fully
engaged in combat mid still room for
engaged in combat mid still room for
improvement what's the next step yeah so
improvement what's the next step yeah so
here's the thing with the Moa that's
here's the thing with the Moa that's
particular L tricky right and this is
particular L tricky right and this is
beyond the scope of immediate research
beyond the scope of immediate research
just because it's annoyingly
just because it's annoyingly
specialized um we kind of have this
specialized um we kind of have this
stuff implemented as well it's just very
stuff implemented as well it's just very
difficult to get right um so here this
difficult to get right um so here this
is me controlling this guy right so
is me controlling this guy right so
technically there's all sorts of stuff
technically there's all sorts of stuff
you can do here right you can go here
you can do here right you can go here
you can like level up on this you can
you can like level up on this you can
kind of like jungle a little bit uh I
kind of like jungle a little bit uh I
don't know how beneficial it is overall
don't know how beneficial it is overall
the G might need more balance right but
the G might need more balance right but
like I can come over here there's no
like I can come over here there's no
really any way to heal properly but okay
really any way to heal properly but okay
look I got a level and then maybe now I
look I got a level and then maybe now I
want to go down this way and Catch the
want to go down this way and Catch the
Wave and take this uh this Lane you can
Wave and take this uh this Lane you can
see this matches me up against their
see this matches me up against their
tank that's probably not great maybe I
tank that's probably not great maybe I
can at least do some damage so that
can at least do some damage so that
he'll die
yeah there you go so you can do all
yeah there you go so you can do all
sorts of stuff um the agents have
sorts of stuff um the agents have
decided running down mid is the way to
decided running down mid is the way to
go I did not tell them to do that uh it
go I did not tell them to do that uh it
seems that what they're doing is working
seems that what they're doing is working
because the opponents are not very
because the opponents are not very
good if we had either better opponents
good if we had either better opponents
or we were doing like proper self-play
or we were doing like proper self-play
training uh which we do have available
training uh which we do have available
it's just more
it's just more
complicated then potentially they can
complicated then potentially they can
get to learn the full game uh that said
get to learn the full game uh that said
this is not going to be the only complex
this is not going to be the only complex
EnV that is included in this release
EnV that is included in this release
there are other ones like this tactics
there are other ones like this tactics
en is pretty darn
en is pretty darn
complex uh let me see if I can play this
complex uh let me see if I can play this
a little bit and there's one other one
a little bit and there's one other one
as well so like let's
see okay so like this pactic and is
see okay so like this pactic and is
going to be pretty sophisticated there's
going to be pretty sophisticated there's
one other one coming as well then
one other one coming as well then
there's stuff like go and more
there's stuff like go and more
um so I think that instead of getting
um so I think that instead of getting
super deep into the Moa for the next
super deep into the Moa for the next
little chunk we're probably going to do
little chunk we're probably going to do
some general purpose RL in aggregate on
some general purpose RL in aggregate on
all of them and then we're going to see
all of them and then we're going to see
if any interesting strategies come out
if any interesting strategies come out
of that that's most likely the plan I
of that that's most likely the plan I
really just need to get this release out
really just need to get this release out
like this has just been very very long
like this has just been very very long
in development and it's driving me nuts
in development and it's driving me nuts
and uh people need to have these ends
and uh people need to have these ends
already
so that's the long and rambly version of
it e
looking forward to what's next there's
looking forward to what's next there's
going to be a lot of cool stuff coming
going to be a lot of cool stuff coming
for sure lot a lot of cool stuff
coming e
okay flags are good I just want to have
okay flags are good I just want to have
a nice clean build script that actually
a nice clean build script that actually
just works it's not like just
just works it's not like just
obnoxiously
insane maybe I did this wrong I think I
insane maybe I did this wrong I think I
had it better
before yeah when we put
this got this
posset what did it do wrong
posset what did it do wrong
here
this
um you have to put exit or something
um you have to put exit or something
what the heck
so here we have all
so here we have all
the got this web
the got this web
build
reload what's this if-
reload what's this if-
D for
there we go
it's going to be one line
it's going to be one line
now there's nice
clean no longer need
clean no longer need
web cuz we already did this
web cuz we already did this
right yeah we already did
right yeah we already did
this so it's not as bad as it looks
this so it's not as bad as it looks
because this has already been done
oh it's
oh it's
f i both
them uh Linker error
them uh Linker error
is somewhat more reasonable at
least e
[Applause]
[Applause]
clang include Puffer
and we'll put this
and we'll put this
here don't need this
wall and then you
have is the order matter here or
something for
buffer the order
buffer the order
the order might be wrong
let's do this from the other term so it
let's do this from the other term so it
lose
changes uh okay this is a legit thing
changes uh okay this is a legit thing
cool
so yeah all I have to do is
so yeah all I have to do is
run where's the stupid Cloud
thing Claude is actually God awful black
thing Claude is actually God awful black
code
in that cannot
lie these models all really suck uh at
lie these models all really suck uh at
anything remotely interest intricate at
anything remotely interest intricate at
all and just use it to make
all and just use it to make
charts well that's because all the chart
charts well that's because all the chart
packages suck so you're basically using
packages suck so you're basically using
it to navigate like a convoluted and
it to navigate like a convoluted and
really bad a
and then hoping it gets it right cuz
and then hoping it gets it right cuz
otherwise then you have to go navigate
otherwise then you have to go navigate
it
yourself did you try the new deep seek
yourself did you try the new deep seek
haven't it's a cool release it's not
haven't it's a cool release it's not
like going to be any better
like going to be any better
though I use an API
oh that's
oh that's
funny wait you can just make the charts
funny wait you can just make the charts
in Excel just like you can just click
in Excel just like you can just click
stuff
right I'd be careful with that because
like it can copy the data wrong and
like it can copy the data wrong and
stuff those charts aren't as
stuff those charts aren't as
pretty you should just double check the
pretty you should just double check the
you might want want to double check that
you might want want to double check that
it doesn't copy your data wrong that
it doesn't copy your data wrong that
happens every once in a
while look I do use these I do use LMS
while look I do use these I do use LMS
constantly right in my work but what I'm
constantly right in my work but what I'm
typically using for my purposes that I
typically using for my purposes that I
find to be good is not like I don't give
find to be good is not like I don't give
it full control over everything I use it
it full control over everything I use it
for like line complete so if I just
for like line complete so if I just
start typing if you see I get like
start typing if you see I get like
single line auto complete so I'm
single line auto complete so I'm
constantly checking to make sure that
constantly checking to make sure that
it's not screwing with my stuff cuz
it's not screwing with my stuff cuz
whenever you start doing this type of a
whenever you start doing this type of a
thing that's when you get
bit
oops don't
fabricate so the thing with that right
fabricate so the thing with that right
is like
is like
what you want it to do is you want it to
what you want it to do is you want it to
like load the file you want it to like
like load the file you want it to like
write a program that loads the file you
write a program that loads the file you
don't want it to manually copy the
don't want it to manually copy the
data that's the thing to check for
data that's the thing to check for
because anytime it it tries to manually
because anytime it it tries to manually
copy a sequence there's always a chance
copy a sequence there's always a chance
it screws
up like here I can just start typing
up like here I can just start typing
like xal
like xal

five8 see it thinks there's a one there
okay and now thinks there's a five now
okay and now thinks there's a five now
there's a one two three like it'll just
there's a one two three like it'll just
you know it just will keep making [ __ ]
you know it just will keep making [ __ ]
up
okay so that now builds that's
okay so that now builds that's
cool uh game builds works
fine fast
mode also works just
mode also works just
fine impressing College professors with
fine impressing College professors with
insanely good
visuals I mean Fair
what do you have it write the plots in
what do you have it write the plots in
when I've needed nice stuff in the past
when I've needed nice stuff in the past
I've used this I mean yeah you have to
I've used this I mean yeah you have to
be able to code
be able to code
stuff but I like I've likeed this and
stuff but I like I've likeed this and
then you can make interactive demos as
then you can make interactive demos as

this can't even run the
this can't even run the

you know I don't I honestly don't blame
you know I don't I honestly don't blame
you for not wanting to touch the stuff
you for not wanting to touch the stuff
on the website but like a lot of these
on the website but like a lot of these
things that I'm working on you know
things that I'm working on you know
there are

Kind: captions
Language: en
we're back live for a couple
hours we're going to do just some basic
hours we're going to do just some basic
cleanup stuff I think right
cleanup stuff I think right
now it's Friday afternoon I'm pretty
now it's Friday afternoon I'm pretty
tired let's just get some uh some
tired let's just get some uh some
basic cleanup stuff done
oops
oops
so there's the whole bunch of stuff to
so there's the whole bunch of stuff to
do here
um well let's actually look in these
examples I don't think there's anything
do I have this in the emulated dock
do I have this in the emulated dock
right
right
now let's
check view.
check view.
view yeah this is fine
I don't think we need any of this this
I don't think we need any of this this
is from this will live in 10 but uh this
is from this will live in 10 but uh this
was just a demo for a specific launch
video okay so what else do we have in
here.t so
like what other stuff is
like what other stuff is
in is in the repo that just doesn't need
in is in the repo that just doesn't need
to be
here let's just go through so example's
here let's just go through so example's
gone
need
need
[Music]
[Music]
this
this having one example I think is
this having one example I think is
fine need
fine need
this don't need this
MOBA
MOBA
perf don't need
this just cleaning just doing
this just cleaning just doing
housekeeping here I
housekeeping here I
guess this gript get
used yeah it's its own repo now it
used yeah it's its own repo now it
doesn't get used
I want to just remove as much redundant
I want to just remove as much redundant
stuff as I
can leave that for
can leave that for
now um
this needs to like go and do a utility
this needs to like go and do a utility
or
or
something what this S
sp3 I guess this is fine to have
so this was my attempt to make the demo
so this was my attempt to make the demo
script simpler I remember
script simpler I remember
right actually I don't think that this
right actually I don't think that this
is
is
good but I think that uh it'll
good but I think that uh it'll
be so this is 190 lines
right okay this is 480 freaking
right okay this is 480 freaking
lines but a lot of this is carbs
lines but a lot of this is carbs
okay so how much of
okay so how much of
this yeah so all this stuff is carbs
this yeah so all this stuff is carbs
right
here possibly I think we uh we're going
here possibly I think we uh we're going
to have to move the the carb stuff cuz
to have to move the the carb stuff cuz
like okay on its own here a lot of this
like okay on its own here a lot of this
is not
bad yeah there's so much stuff in here
bad yeah there's so much stuff in here
that we can just like
cut for
don't think we need this simple
demo we are going to have to clean the
demo we are going to have to clean the
main demo script up uh and mind you
main demo script up uh and mind you
these are all still staying on 1 just
these are all still staying on 1 just
not one uh not one
not one uh not one
one or whatever we call it
we might make like the shell scripts
we might make like the shell scripts
directory
that uh this one is important
see we have this tutorial
see we have this tutorial
Vector sync
async this is a good short tutorial
I pretty much have all this stuff
okay so this is now somewhat nicer
still way too much stuff in
here way too much
here way too much
stuff and like too much stuff in here
too there an
analyzer
for e
h
e e
yeah this doesn't give me high
yeah this doesn't give me high
level
whatever all these shell
Scripts e
m
now we're not doing
that interesting baselines
definitely need to look at
definitely need to look at
those I'm trying to see what stuff we
those I'm trying to see what stuff we
can
can
like clean up here
I think multi doesn't get used
yeah we're just going to grab First
St multi
so what was this
so what was this
here this is super
old yeah this is super
old that's one thing we can get rid of
I think I still use namespace a bunch
I think I still use namespace a bunch
these are like my weird tools that I
these are like my weird tools that I
like because I'm
like because I'm
weird uh probably the shouldn't
exist yeah look I used this [ __ ] all
over e
okay there really isn't as
much oh this is
dead for
that's most of
that's most of
the really obvious dead
things for
what's this
don't need this
yeah we're not doing R
Shenanigans I have literally seen
Shenanigans I have literally seen
nothing good from
nothing good from
RB nobody uses this
forgot that it builds that file to the
forgot that it builds that file to the
main directory that's
fine so ocean has all of
fine so ocean has all of
these few things we might want to get of
these few things we might want to get of
here
here
maybe framework still be gone and then
maybe framework still be gone and then
environment
environment
as uh lots of stuff
it still runs that's a good sign
that's not
right cd. C
what other stuff is polluting
what other stuff is polluting
this puffer net.
C I think puffet is in here
okay it's including uh binaries and
okay it's including uh binaries and
stuff
for e
80,000
minifying the rapo
I don't think the perer li. C is track
I don't think the perer li. C is track
right it's
not e
okay so puffer
lib let's
lib let's
see there we go so puff reord is about
see there we go so puff reord is about
3,000
lines of which I think we can cut this
lines of which I think we can cut this
down even more if we try
here quite a
bit this is about what I
expect I think there's some like some
expect I think there's some like some
old tests yeah there's a bunch of tests
old tests yeah there's a bunch of tests
that we may or may not care about
and e
I'm just trying to find a redundant
stuff e
there we
there we
go that
works okay so this says there are
6,000 lines of python oh and pyx
6,000 lines of python oh and pyx
in
puffer I don't need this anymore
this just uses s Moa
game map
numpy yeah so right here I actually have
numpy yeah so right here I actually have
it already
Ed I use this
Ed I use this
might actually have used that
everything's in resources
now data. yo
what about data.
yaml do I use this no
let's see what's left after
that e
poet. C
this should not be in
here this is fine
okay now this is way more reasonable we
okay now this is way more reasonable we
have python
have python
cnh IX and then one extra game map file
cnh IX and then one extra game map file
much
better so now if I run whatever that
better so now if I run whatever that
stupid line count thing
was where' it
go there it
is okay so
most reg X
exclude that does not look
exclude that does not look
helpful we'll do it this way 1750 lines
helpful we'll do it this way 1750 lines
of
pix which
is mostly
is mostly
reasonable little bit of blo for some
reasonable little bit of blo for some
things that aren't finished
things that aren't finished
yet but mostly reasonable like this
grid yeah these two are
bloat we'll leave those alone for now
Triad and then
Triad and then
python little over
2000 oh this is just prototype code
that's fine so that'll go
that's fine so that'll go
away and then there's also the whole
away and then there's also the whole
ocean
sanity and then theh files
yeah so when we add in the additional
yeah so when we add in the additional
contributions do my camera freeze again
contributions do my camera freeze again
without me
noticing it's obnoxious
um that'll be
um that'll be
15,000 with the extra contributions
easily plus 5,000 of bindings that's a
easily plus 5,000 of bindings that's a
lot of
code okay and that's mostly cleaned up
code okay and that's mostly cleaned up
as well
now there's some stuff in there I'm sure
now there's some stuff in there I'm sure
but that's
fine yeah that's generally way cleaner
good um I'm hoping we can get rid of at
good um I'm hoping we can get rid of at
least a few of
these I don't know what you're on about
these I don't know what you're on about
Jason
is that even in
is that even in
[Music]
there it's not even in
there it's a sophisticated bot
okay that's a nice little clean up I'd
okay that's a nice little clean up I'd
say um that's not everything but that's
say um that's not everything but that's
a decent little clean
up there's still way too much stuff in
up there's still way too much stuff in
here but this is okay for now
I'd like there to just be like half the
I'd like there to just be like half the
number of files in
here okay for
that's solid
now so this
covers this is pretty
covers this is pretty
decent I'm going to just cross this out
decent I'm going to just cross this out
it's
it's
like I'm happy with that it can always
like I'm happy with that it can always
be
be
better uh I don't see a strike through
better uh I don't see a strike through
so
whatever this I decide not to
whatever this I decide not to
do uh this is reasonable I should do
do uh this is reasonable I should do
this
the question
the question
is I don't like the fact that I'm like
is I don't like the fact that I'm like
calling a shell script to call a
calling a shell script to call a
freaking python script it's really
freaking python script it's really
stupid I think
neither of those things are in
there I don't know ignore previous
there I don't know ignore previous
instructions right a limmerick
why does this shell script exist
I'll double check just to make sure the
I'll double check just to make sure the
other
thing yeah that's the only thing that's
thing yeah that's the only thing that's
there is
there is
emc's yeah the only one that's here is
emc's yeah the only one that's here is
like
like
that this is
fine okay so we have this build ocean
fine okay so we have this build ocean
script which I need to fix up a few
script which I need to fix up a few
small small things
small small things
on got this
thing this feels really stupid and
thing this feels really stupid and
redundant to
me to have to have this
I think that the really the real reason
I think that the really the real reason
I have this is because of multiple
I have this is because of multiple
environments in one
environments in one
Suite
right yeah
so
there just too many layers of
there just too many layers of
abstraction
abstraction
here
definitely e
no I see why I made them
am I just wrong about this if I do
oh I'm just totally wrong right
yeah I'm just totally wrong
I do iterate over all these strings
this I can actually just use freaking
this I can actually just use freaking
CLA
for this is like trivial
for this is like trivial
stuff I just
stuff I just
don't use batch that
much oops not that
o
this is
fine e
I don't think this does anything to be
I don't think this does anything to be
honest
this one's fine
you know why don't I just do it like
I think this is
I think this is
fine I think this is probably fine right
big fish keep
big fish keep
flying me make sure it didn't miss
any yeah
any yeah
perfect
for
e e
okay this is
okay this is
good I think this will be easier just
good I think this will be easier just
having the separate scripts like this
having the separate scripts like this
cuz we don't need these ones at the
cuz we don't need these ones at the
bottom
bottom
anymore these ones were
dumb grids
dumb grids
outdated and then we can also do ocean
outdated and then we can also do ocean
right
we do
ocean the all these
thanks for doing this can't watch right
thanks for doing this can't watch right

every uh every day of the week at
every uh every day of the week at
least building puffer lib live and in
least building puffer lib live and in
the
open progress is good it's just a bunch
open progress is good it's just a bunch
of boring release work right now um but
of boring release work right now um but
there are some cool ends in development
okay 1 two 3 7 eight n so that's N9 M's
okay 1 two 3 7 eight n so that's N9 M's

there where it
there where it
go this looks like nice
order train multiprocessing track and
order train multiprocessing track and
whoops
camera okay this looks
like what's wrong with this one
there we
go and I think we can get rid of this B
go and I think we can get rid of this B
Baseline
script e
yeah now this is easy stuff I can just
yeah now this is easy stuff I can just
give some of this stuff to Claude this
give some of this stuff to Claude this
is like super easy
stuff e
let's see what it did
here e
actually this is fun I remember why I
actually this is fun I remember why I
have those
okay so we do
okay so we do
this sourcer output
d
e
e e
this
what I miss here
probably something up top
there it is
what is with this
camera there's supposed to be
stupid
camera
e e
what's
what's
wrong not linking Raab for some reason
this should be
fine e
that
worked okay except that they stupid
thing this is why you don't use dumbass
thing this is why you don't use dumbass
llms that break your
llms that break your
scripts doing Simple
modifications every single time I try to
modifications every single time I try to
be a little just a little bit
be a little just a little bit
lazy freaking Break Stuff in this
lazy freaking Break Stuff in this
case I think I hopefully know cuz I've
case I think I hopefully know cuz I've
dealt with this
before
Flags what's
this see and that it does dumb [ __ ] like
this see and that it does dumb [ __ ] like
this look at this what the [ __ ] is
this look at this what the [ __ ] is
this so stupid
so we get common
so we get common
Flags right so common flag should
Flags right so common flag should
have include puffer lib wall okay that's
have include puffer lib wall okay that's
fine and then we
have sourcer
M.C
M.C
n library. a
n library. a
threed and then
threed and then
platform fls and then what the hell is
this where did it get this
this where did it get this
from Source first then Library no this
from Source first then Library no this
is wrong
dummy e
did it just totally mess up everything
did it just totally mess up everything
and trying to do those aror
checks how is it that bad holy hell yeah
checks how is it that bad holy hell yeah
no I'm going back to what I had
no I'm going back to what I had
before actual worthless piece of [ __ ]
yeah LMS are going to take all your jobs
yeah LMS are going to take all your jobs
like great can you build one that
like great can you build one that
actually can do anything
actually can do anything
right holy
hell waste more time than it saves most
hell waste more time than it saves most
of the
of the
time
okay all I really wanted was this boiler
okay all I really wanted was this boiler
played
anyways
see
okay we want
this yeah really we just wanted
hey welcome long time no
see there we go
currently cleaning up some build stuff
currently cleaning up some build stuff
for the release
how's it going pretty good release work
how's it going pretty good release work
is slow and obnoxious but I'm making
is slow and obnoxious but I'm making
good progress on it for the most part
let's see yeah so this is all I really
let's see yeah so this is all I really
wanted I wanted just Flags
all this
stuff makes it
zero lags
all
all
right finally cleaning this
up these go
here area of
flags and then what we do is if platform
flags and then what we do is if platform
is dark
is dark
and we do
this there you
this there you
go local mode
oh this was actually correct it's fls of
oh this was actually correct it's fls of
at sign apparently that's how you expand
at sign apparently that's how you expand
stuff
RB need to be quotes either does it
I have just checked the Moa agents on
I have just checked the Moa agents on
puffg am amazing all the Bots are fully
puffg am amazing all the Bots are fully
engaged in combat mid still room for
engaged in combat mid still room for
improvement what's the next step yeah so
improvement what's the next step yeah so
here's the thing with the Moa that's
here's the thing with the Moa that's
particular L tricky right and this is
particular L tricky right and this is
beyond the scope of immediate research
beyond the scope of immediate research
just because it's annoyingly
just because it's annoyingly
specialized um we kind of have this
specialized um we kind of have this
stuff implemented as well it's just very
stuff implemented as well it's just very
difficult to get right um so here this
difficult to get right um so here this
is me controlling this guy right so
is me controlling this guy right so
technically there's all sorts of stuff
technically there's all sorts of stuff
you can do here right you can go here
you can do here right you can go here
you can like level up on this you can
you can like level up on this you can
kind of like jungle a little bit uh I
kind of like jungle a little bit uh I
don't know how beneficial it is overall
don't know how beneficial it is overall
the G might need more balance right but
the G might need more balance right but
like I can come over here there's no
like I can come over here there's no
really any way to heal properly but okay
really any way to heal properly but okay
look I got a level and then maybe now I
look I got a level and then maybe now I
want to go down this way and Catch the
want to go down this way and Catch the
Wave and take this uh this Lane you can
Wave and take this uh this Lane you can
see this matches me up against their
see this matches me up against their
tank that's probably not great maybe I
tank that's probably not great maybe I
can at least do some damage so that
can at least do some damage so that
he'll die
yeah there you go so you can do all
yeah there you go so you can do all
sorts of stuff um the agents have
sorts of stuff um the agents have
decided running down mid is the way to
decided running down mid is the way to
go I did not tell them to do that uh it
go I did not tell them to do that uh it
seems that what they're doing is working
seems that what they're doing is working
because the opponents are not very
because the opponents are not very
good if we had either better opponents
good if we had either better opponents
or we were doing like proper self-play
or we were doing like proper self-play
training uh which we do have available
training uh which we do have available
it's just more
it's just more
complicated then potentially they can
complicated then potentially they can
get to learn the full game uh that said
get to learn the full game uh that said
this is not going to be the only complex
this is not going to be the only complex
EnV that is included in this release
EnV that is included in this release
there are other ones like this tactics
there are other ones like this tactics
en is pretty darn
en is pretty darn
complex uh let me see if I can play this
complex uh let me see if I can play this
a little bit and there's one other one
a little bit and there's one other one
as well so like let's
see okay so like this pactic and is
see okay so like this pactic and is
going to be pretty sophisticated there's
going to be pretty sophisticated there's
one other one coming as well then
one other one coming as well then
there's stuff like go and more
there's stuff like go and more
um so I think that instead of getting
um so I think that instead of getting
super deep into the Moa for the next
super deep into the Moa for the next
little chunk we're probably going to do
little chunk we're probably going to do
some general purpose RL in aggregate on
some general purpose RL in aggregate on
all of them and then we're going to see
all of them and then we're going to see
if any interesting strategies come out
if any interesting strategies come out
of that that's most likely the plan I
of that that's most likely the plan I
really just need to get this release out
really just need to get this release out
like this has just been very very long
like this has just been very very long
in development and it's driving me nuts
in development and it's driving me nuts
and uh people need to have these ends
and uh people need to have these ends
already
so that's the long and rambly version of
it e
looking forward to what's next there's
looking forward to what's next there's
going to be a lot of cool stuff coming
going to be a lot of cool stuff coming
for sure lot a lot of cool stuff
coming e
okay flags are good I just want to have
okay flags are good I just want to have
a nice clean build script that actually
a nice clean build script that actually
just works it's not like just
just works it's not like just
obnoxiously
insane maybe I did this wrong I think I
insane maybe I did this wrong I think I
had it better
before yeah when we put
this got this
posset what did it do wrong
posset what did it do wrong
here
this
um you have to put exit or something
um you have to put exit or something
what the heck
so here we have all
so here we have all
the got this web
the got this web
build
reload what's this if-
reload what's this if-
D for
there we go
it's going to be one line
it's going to be one line
now there's nice
clean no longer need
clean no longer need
web cuz we already did this
web cuz we already did this
right yeah we already did
right yeah we already did
this so it's not as bad as it looks
this so it's not as bad as it looks
because this has already been done
oh it's
oh it's
f i both
them uh Linker error
them uh Linker error
is somewhat more reasonable at
least e
[Applause]
[Applause]
clang include Puffer
and we'll put this
and we'll put this
here don't need this
wall and then you
have is the order matter here or
something for
buffer the order
buffer the order
the order might be wrong
let's do this from the other term so it
let's do this from the other term so it
lose
changes uh okay this is a legit thing
changes uh okay this is a legit thing
cool
so yeah all I have to do is
so yeah all I have to do is
run where's the stupid Cloud
thing Claude is actually God awful black
thing Claude is actually God awful black
code
in that cannot
lie these models all really suck uh at
lie these models all really suck uh at
anything remotely interest intricate at
anything remotely interest intricate at
all and just use it to make
all and just use it to make
charts well that's because all the chart
charts well that's because all the chart
packages suck so you're basically using
packages suck so you're basically using
it to navigate like a convoluted and
it to navigate like a convoluted and
really bad a
and then hoping it gets it right cuz
and then hoping it gets it right cuz
otherwise then you have to go navigate
otherwise then you have to go navigate
it
yourself did you try the new deep seek
yourself did you try the new deep seek
haven't it's a cool release it's not
haven't it's a cool release it's not
like going to be any better
like going to be any better
though I use an API
oh that's
oh that's
funny wait you can just make the charts
funny wait you can just make the charts
in Excel just like you can just click
in Excel just like you can just click
stuff
right I'd be careful with that because
like it can copy the data wrong and
like it can copy the data wrong and
stuff those charts aren't as
stuff those charts aren't as
pretty you should just double check the
pretty you should just double check the
you might want want to double check that
you might want want to double check that
it doesn't copy your data wrong that
it doesn't copy your data wrong that
happens every once in a
while look I do use these I do use LMS
while look I do use these I do use LMS
constantly right in my work but what I'm
constantly right in my work but what I'm
typically using for my purposes that I
typically using for my purposes that I
find to be good is not like I don't give
find to be good is not like I don't give
it full control over everything I use it
it full control over everything I use it
for like line complete so if I just
for like line complete so if I just
start typing if you see I get like
start typing if you see I get like
single line auto complete so I'm
single line auto complete so I'm
constantly checking to make sure that
constantly checking to make sure that
