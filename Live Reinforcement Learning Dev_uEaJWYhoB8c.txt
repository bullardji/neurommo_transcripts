wandb see what what is finished cuz I
wandb see what what is finished cuz I
kind of just launched a bunch of giant
kind of just launched a bunch of giant
sweeps and then let him run all weekend

it looks like they're still going though

they're probably close enough to being

happens if we run these for a

two so that's fun I ran almost a

thousand

experiments so here's Breakout
look at
that I don't know what Max score is on
breakout is there a Max
score 448 points per

screen and I'm
assuming can you actually do that with
Atari
Atari
H that's
H that's
interesting I don't know if it's
interesting I don't know if it's
achievable with the port that we have at
achievable with the port that we have at
the moment but uh these graphs are

really
really
cool because I can so this is how hold
cool because I can so this is how hold
on let it load a lot of experiments so

this is how over the course of carbs you

can kind of see that it's gotten better

also you can do relative time

see so if I look at here's episode

reward over time right all these

experiments I got to H how do I do this
um yeah cuz it'll only show a

the original clean ARL implementation is
