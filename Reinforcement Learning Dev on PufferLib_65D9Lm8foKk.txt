evening. We are back
evening. We are back
live.
Hi. I have some experiments to set up
Hi. I have some experiments to set up
and then if Gabe is around, we're going
and then if Gabe is around, we're going
to review his code. Then the only other
to review his code. Then the only other
thing I want to check
first
is right here.
Okay, so this container did get a bit
Okay, so this container did get a bit
bigger. This is a 12 gig
bigger. This is a 12 gig
container. So I don't know where the
container. So I don't know where the
extra seven is coming
from. I'll figure that
from. I'll figure that
out. I'll focus on that.
All
right. And
Gabe got a shake.
Awful.
God. Got to actually get my protein in
God. Got to actually get my protein in
though for once.
You go just go check if there's an
You go just go check if there's an
expiration date on that stuff real
quick. Nope. Not expired. just
awful. I will uh have to
awful. I will uh have to
find a way to
find a way to
get some more
consistent. All
right.

You'll be good in 10 minutes.
It's not that freaking hard.
It's not that freaking hard.
Like, it's a pretty small set of

keyboard shortcuts that you need to make
keyboard shortcuts that you need to make
it dramatically better than uh, you
it dramatically better than uh, you
know, your normal

within a week it'll be pretty natural.
did not learn to type. Nah, my guy.
did not learn to type. Nah, my guy.
That's not a freaking excuse. All right.
That's not a freaking excuse. All right.
I had three like it literally like
I had three like it literally like
they'd have to get they had to give me
they'd have to get they had to give me
like three hours of test um before they
like three hours of test um before they
actually like timed the tests when I was
actually like timed the tests when I was
growing up because I how slow I freaking

Gabe. Doing
well. I uh I'm on stream. I hope you
well. I uh I'm on stream. I hope you
don't mind. But uh code review time.

Welcome,
Jose. X, Twitch, and
YouTube. Do Pac-Man review.
We can't hear him, by the way. My bad.
We can't hear him, by the way. My bad.
Let me fix
that. How do I fix that?
Say something. What do you Oh, wait. No,
Say something. What do you Oh, wait. No,
it should work.
What should work? Sorry. the stream
audio good
now. All right, let's take a look at
now. All right, let's take a look at
these
PRs. The heck is
this?
this?
Okay. Submit like really weird tiny PRs.
So let's see this PR different ghost

this vector. What is this?
That's a new type, I think.
That's a new type, I think.
Maybe it's actually kind of a while
Maybe it's actually kind of a while
since I wrote this code. It's not
since I wrote this code. It's not
defined anywhere. So, I assume is it
defined anywhere. So, I assume is it
from Raleigh?
Maybe. I don't think so
Maybe. I don't think so
though. I think it might just be defined

But that you can't do that and see.
But that you can't do that and see.
Oh, wait. You can because it's a macro.
Oh, wait. You can because it's a macro.
Yeah, I think that's it. That still
Yeah, I think that's it. That still
might not be ideal, though. Okay. So,
yeah,
yeah,

Type defract. No, the like prefixing

Huh.
Huh.
Um, I think that was to distinguish from

Rayb has a vector too. And I think I
Rayb has a vector too. And I think I
wanted to distinguish this as a integer

I very rarely make a pause vector, but

That's for the map specifically. This is

Right. Yeah. Which there's only one map
Right. Yeah. Which there's only one map
hardcoded right now, but it's just a
hardcoded right now, but it's just a
string. So, you could very easily have

more maps
and it's just a char array. So, yeah,
and it's just a char array. So, yeah,
actually, this is totally fine.
actually, this is totally fine.
Yeah, it would it would be cool if there

It could be kind of interesting. I now

Are the positions floats?
Um, no. I think everything is an integer

correctly.
I actually don't know. Let me
I actually don't know. Let me
see. I think I've checked the output

before,
before,
but could be good to double check.
I just don't remember how a promotion
works. Okay, so they're both float.

Good.
I literally don't remember these.
Yeah, I don't either. This is also a
Yeah, I don't either. This is also a

well I remember which ones to be careful
about though, right? Yeah. Like if you

didn't have float in front of map with
didn't have float in front of map with
it definitely wouldn't be a float when
it definitely wouldn't be a float when
you divide it. Yeah. So
you divide it. Yeah. So
I it makes sense it gets promoted to a
I it makes sense it gets promoted to a
float. I just could have been other way.
This I don't think has to be cast
This I don't think has to be cast
because I think this will just get
because I think this will just get
implicitly cast because the ops is a
implicitly cast because the ops is a
float. Um that makes sense. And then not
float. Um that makes sense. And then not
frightened and not
good. We give it some ops.
Oh, wait. This is ghost observations.
Oh, wait. This is ghost observations.
Yeah. So that's per ghost. So this is
Yeah. So that's per ghost. So this is
what the ghosts see or you see the
what the ghosts see or you see the
ghost. You see the ghosts. So the ghosts
ghost. You see the ghosts. So the ghosts
aren't agents. Those are hardcoded.
Technically, they could be. That would
Technically, they could be. That would
be kind of funny. It would be. I feel
be kind of funny. It would be. I feel
like ghost would be a little OP if they
like ghost would be a little OP if they
were smarter. Like Yeah. I think that
were smarter. Like Yeah. I think that
you just You couldn't win the game,
you just You couldn't win the game,
right? Yeah. Four versus
right? Yeah. Four versus
one. Maybe you could do one ghost versus
one. Maybe you could do one ghost versus
one agent and it would be more even.
I am questioning whether this array
I am questioning whether this array
observation is the right approach at
observation is the right approach at
all or if a grid view would be better
all or if a grid view would be better

I would the same as I've done every
I would the same as I've done every
other M and I just give it an 11 by 11
other M and I just give it an 11 by 11
crop tiles around it.
I can do that. I mean, I don't even
I can do that. I mean, I don't even
know. I don't know how good that is,
know. I don't know how good that is,
frankly, because like you kind of want
frankly, because like you kind of want
to be able to see the ghost from a
to be able to see the ghost from a
little farther away.
little farther away.
But let me see. So, you have the ghost
But let me see. So, you have the ghost

Mhm.

I think I did try that at some point.
I think I did try that at some point.
kind of went back and forth.
kind of went back and forth.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Ghost
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Ghost
observations this
correctly. You do you give it an
offset player observation count
offset player observation count
presumably is 11.
Yes, should be.
Yes, should be.
Yes.
Yes.
Unless I've made a silly
mistake. Those dot pointers again
there. Yeah, you definitely are making
there. Yeah, you definitely are making
this hard on
yourself. I do such stupid things, but
yourself. I do such stupid things, but
they're like so simple. But one of the
they're like so simple. But one of the
things I did as well, you have a
things I did as well, you have a
separate ghost struck, don't you? Versus
separate ghost struck, don't you? Versus
player. Yes. Yep. So, one of the things
player. Yes. Yep. So, one of the things
that I will often do is I'll just make
that I will often do is I'll just make
like an
like an
entity. It's like, wait, but but what
entity. It's like, wait, but but what
about, you know, the player can't be
about, you know, the player can't be
frightened and the player can't it
frightened and the player can't it
doesn't matter. Just ignore those
doesn't matter. Just ignore those
attributes cuz then you can put all the
attributes cuz then you can put all the

You can put a you can just like put like

You have lives.
Um, no. Then what's reset round? Is it?
Um, no. Then what's reset round? Is it?
Oh, is this different from C reset?

I guess it just moves it to it starting

I really try to keep stuff just super

So, that actually does scan through the

Okay.
Yeah, this is
actually Yeah, feel like that's that is
actually Yeah, feel like that's that is
a little bit funky now that I see it
a little bit funky now that I see it
again. The reset
again. The reset
round because a lot of that stuff I'm

doing you would only need to do

a reset. I
think it's like I'm putting a spawn
think it's like I'm putting a spawn
position on the ghost. Why don't I just
position on the ghost. Why don't I just
set them to their spawn position? Yeah,
set them to their spawn position? Yeah,
they already have they would already

have it.
My initial guess just like like just
My initial guess just like like just
like random guess of like how many lines
like random guess of like how many lines
do I think Pac-Man would be? like 600
do I think Pac-Man would be? like 600
700 and I think that's probably about
700 and I think that's probably about
how short I could make it. Um, just
how short I could make it. Um, just
fiddling with
things. So, it's like so far everything
things. So, it's like so far everything
makes sense. I could definitely see

places to make it more
places to make it more

succinct, but I'm not like what the heck
is this at anything.
Oh,
So Blinky targets the player.
So Blinky targets the player.
Yep. Pinky the most direct

go to where it thinks the player's

Yes. Okay.
Yes. Okay.
And then this one
And then this one
has just a different lead.
has just a different lead.
That's the most confusing one.
That's the most confusing one.
Um, and it's like that in the original
Um, and it's like that in the original
game. Um, there's a lead, but then it
game. Um, there's a lead, but then it
incorporates Blinky's
incorporates Blinky's
position over that lead.
position over that lead.
Um, it's pretty weird, but that's that's
Um, it's pretty weird, but that's that's
how it
works. And then glide is
works. And then glide is
just it targets the player if it's far
just it targets the player if it's far
away, but then if you're close to the
away, but then if you're close to the
player, it goes back to its corner.
Okay,
that might be a little funky. Well, the
that might be a little funky. Well, the
thing that's funky about it is
thing that's funky about it is
like if you have a grid, you may as well
like if you have a grid, you may as well
use it.
Yeah, the the grid is not used as much
Yeah, the the grid is not used as much
as it could be. It
as it could be. It
definitely made much simpler.
definitely made much simpler.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Have you looked at like some of the the
Have you looked at like some of the the
logic in MOA?

Nope. So, that thing runs I don't know
Nope. So, that thing runs I don't know
at least several hundred thousand steps
at least several hundred thousand steps

ever played League or Dota, all the

Um it has

it's still like it's still really

fast. So some of the techniques in there

are kind of cool.
Nice. The the nice thing about Pac-Man

is like you don't even really need real

Like the g the map is such that if you

just always move towards the target,

you'll get there. Like there's no

there's nothing to get stuck on.
there's nothing to get stuck on.
Yeah. Well, in my case, we did a we
Yeah. Well, in my case, we did a we
premputed all the pathing in MOA.
premputed all the pathing in MOA.
Mhm. So, it's a 128x 128 grid, which
Mhm. So, it's a 128x 128 grid, which
means you need a 128x 128x 128 by 128
means you need a 128x 128x 128 by 128
cache of
pathfinding 100 something megs.
Yeah, I would have definitely used the
Yeah, I would have definitely used the
grid more and I would have definitely
grid more and I would have definitely
had um like an entity array that contain
had um like an entity array that contain
uh the ghost and maybe even the
player. I think with those two things,
player. I think with those two things,
you'd cut at least like 150 lines off.
Oh, actually I said 600
Oh, actually I said 600
650 and we are there. Uh we're actually
650 and we are there. Uh we're actually
that's where we are now. Um and this is
that's where we are now. Um and this is
just rendering.
We might still be able to cut some stuff
We might still be able to cut some stuff
off though. I think you're right. I
off though. I think you're right. I
still think you could actually I might
still think you could actually I might
have overshot then because I think you
have overshot then because I think you
could cut 100 or 150 lines off.
could cut 100 or 150 lines off.
I can take a look at some of the
I can take a look at some of the

it is.
So far, the only two style things I'd

actually ask you to do would be four

cut like giant signatures at some

But I'm what I'm going to do is I'm

going to merge it anyways so that we can

Yeah, I think I will.
Yeah, I think I will.
Long long weekend, do you? I'll just be
Long long weekend, do you? I'll just be
grinding on the release.
Okay. And this would be like where you'd
Okay. And this would be like where you'd
have a texture atlas, but then you'd
have a texture atlas, but then you'd
still have to have a bigger array of
still have to have a bigger array of

That might be old.
Holy. What are we doing here with the

This is how the map's drawn.

Let me see. Um, his wall.
That's how it does the corner tiles.

Really?
Oh, okay. Yeah, that is good. I've had
Oh, okay. Yeah, that is good. I've had
to do this before. It is not
to do this before. It is not
fun. So,
fun. So,
um, the worst freaking thing I've I had
um, the worst freaking thing I've I had
to do for this actually goes up right
to do for this actually goes up right
here at the neural MMO. See the map? You

have all the the terrain merges together

and the tiles are lurped as well.
and the tiles are lurped as well.
Yeah, it looks great. This is the same
Yeah, it looks great. This is the same
sort of a thing,
sort of a thing,
right, where like you have to like do
right, where like you have to like do
this horrendous tile
this horrendous tile
mapping and it ends up being like
um it's just like a table lookup, but
um it's just like a table lookup, but
populating that table's a pain because
populating that table's a pain because
it's like it's it's a full bite. It's
it's like it's it's a full bite. It's
like 256 possibilities or whatever is

just how the math works out because you
just how the math works out because you
have your center tile which is always

everything else has options. So it's

eight other tiles that can be zero or

table just

sucks. Yeah, good job. I know that that
sucks. Yeah, good job. I know that that
I know that logic for drawing those
I know that logic for drawing those
things freaking sucks. Yeah. And you've
things freaking sucks. Yeah. And you've
got more tile types. Wait, I've got like
got more tile types. Wait, I've got like
very futile types, but still has to
very futile types, but still has to
handle the corners. I got to ask. You
handle the corners. I got to ask. You
couldn't have gotten a static map for

Yeah. No, that could be static. My

reasoning was that the compiler would

Oh, yeah. No, it's not it's not that
Oh, yeah. No, it's not it's not that
it's slow. It's my uh I mean it's it's
it's slow. It's my uh I mean it's it's
about the fact that you had to put

yourself through writing it.
That's true. I I mean was like if you're

Yeah. No, I think it would be you could
Yeah. No, I think it would be you could
make a map generator for this very
make a map generator for this very

I mean, you could do
I mean, you could do

I think like something kind of funny

about Pac-Man is like even if there

computationally complex. Yeah. To get it

No. Oh, hang on.
Wait, test.
Just wanted to show you the um the new
Just wanted to show you the um the new

cool. And it kind of has like a similar
cool. And it kind of has like a similar
like pathfinding vibe.
Because there's a bunch of tiles,

Let me show you this real quick and then

That's interesting. That might kind of

Well,
Well,
there's your problem.
there's your problem.
Yeah, that's all right.
Okay. So, it's bugged and uh it found a

Huh. Um
Huh. Um
try your build.
It looked like they were the agent was

I can play it just
fine. Come here, you tasty ghost. Wait,
fine. Come here, you tasty ghost. Wait,
aren't you supposed to be faster than
aren't you supposed to be faster than
the ghost when you eat a pill?
I didn't really know how to do that with

Oh, well then you're never going to eat

It's definitely harder to

just Well, if he's going to be stupid,
just Well, if he's going to be stupid,

when they're they're scattering.
when they're they're scattering.
I can't beat this thing, can I? It's
I can't beat this thing, can I? It's
like really freaking hard to beat it
like really freaking hard to beat it
when they are like that. Uh and other
when they are like that. Uh and other
stuff. Yeah. No, that's that's the
stuff. Yeah. No, that's that's the

Well, now it is hard. Maybe too hard.
Well, I mean, there was definitely with

look like this. Yeah, that looked like

If I just do like this,
you know what that might be? That might
you know what that might be? That might
be my interpolation logic
glitched. Like maybe the it's not

I think you might be right about making

whatever. And the way that you do it,
it's you look at the MOA. Um the MOA has

a really nice system. We use the same
a really nice system. We use the same
sort of thing for GPU drive. It's a

really good system. So, you have a grid.
really good system. So, you have a grid.
Your agent's on a grid, but the agent
Your agent's on a grid, but the agent
also has a continuous position. You just
also has a continuous position. You just
move it on the grid when it crosses tile
move it on the grid when it crosses tile
bounds. It's really easy to render. It's

ridiculously fast because you just have
ridiculously fast because you just have
to check tiles, right? Especially if

only one thing can occupy a
only one thing can occupy a
tile. It's like incredibly easy to work

num ghost. Let's stop.
num ghost. Let's stop.
That looks fun.
You know, almost seems like as if the
You know, almost seems like as if the

Right.
Uhoh. Gotcha.
I
gotcha. Well, your animation isn't being
gotcha. Well, your animation isn't being
updated here either, but it's actually
updated here either, but it's actually
moving around now. Yep. Why does the
moving around now. Yep. Why does the
animation not get updated? Is it because
animation not get updated? Is it because
of that frame time thing? I wonder. I
of that frame time thing? I wonder. I
think it's got to be. Yeah. So, I fixed
think it's got to be. Yeah. So, I fixed
your end. Um, you see this has to float
your end. Um, you see this has to float
to your int.
to your int.
Yep.
Yep.
Got him.
You know why I found it that quickly?
You know why I found it that quickly?
Cuz I did the same bloody thing
Cuz I did the same bloody thing
yesterday.
Oh, that's a little bit better, don't
Oh, that's a little bit better, don't
you think? That's a whole lot better.
you think? That's a whole lot better.
What's max score?
What's max score?
Should be the number of
Should be the number of
tiles plus Let me Let me double check.
tiles plus Let me Let me double check.
It's the number of tiles plus the number
It's the number of tiles plus the number
of power ups.
of power ups.
But the power ups got a bonus bonus
But the power ups got a bonus bonus
points for those. I think five points
points for those. I think five points
per power up and there's four.
per power up and there's four.
That doesn't track because it's over
That doesn't track because it's over
that. It is over that. You get points
that. It is over that. You get points
for ghost.
for ghost.
Yes, you do get points for ghosts. I
Yes, you do get points for ghosts. I
would add like a powerup seat and then
would add like a powerup seat and then
ghost seat. Add a couple stats.
ghost seat. Add a couple stats.
That still seems like that might not
That still seems like that might not
track. Like that might be too high. I'm
track. Like that might be too high. I'm
not sure. Let's see how good the agent
not sure. Let's see how good the agent
is, though. But we're not going to be

able to tell until I fix that evil thing
able to tell until I fix that evil thing
on you. Uh we'll see if the dots go away
on you. Uh we'll see if the dots go away
at
least. The goal definitely is get all

So if we do that out of the

This would be first thing we tried which
This would be first thing we tried which
I think will be to great credit of the

uh the new algorithm because there's no
uh the new algorithm because there's no

Okay,
we kind of have like a ridiculously good
we kind of have like a ridiculously good
reinforcement learning algorithm now for

what it is. Nice. Um this it has soded
what it is. Nice. Um this it has soded
out of the box two different client

Nice. That's awesome.
There's anyone on YouTube here watching
There's anyone on YouTube here watching
is in industry wants their reinforcement
is in industry wants their reinforcement
learning to actually work. Let me
learning to actually work. Let me
know. We make it easy.
Huh? Oh, it's get it's going. That looks
Huh? Oh, it's get it's going. That looks
good. Okay, so the score is the score is
good. Okay, so the score is the score is
completely different then from what cuz
completely different then from what cuz
it's getting 200 something
it's getting 200 something
which is definitely not bad. Like that's
which is definitely not bad. Like that's
way better than random.
way better than random.
Oh, this is about as well as I was
Oh, this is about as well as I was
doing, I think.
doing, I think.
So the question is why is there a
So the question is why is there a
discrepancy between this score
discrepancy between this score
number what's being
logged? Oh it you can see it's eating
logged? Oh it you can see it's eating
ghosts. Does their animations change to
ghosts. Does their animations change to
eaten? Yep.
Uh it starting position is not being
Uh it starting position is not being
randomized.
randomized.
No, by default it's not. How do we do
No, by default it's not. How do we do
that? There is an option to do that. Um
that? There is an option to do that. Um
go in the trainer there. It should be
go in the trainer there. It should be
one of the things passed in from the
one of the things passed in from the
Python side.
Randomized starting. Yep. That's for the
Randomized starting. Yep. That's for the
player.
So, um
does that need to be energy. Yeah. I'm
does that need to be energy. Yeah. I'm
going to try it like this if you don't
mind. That looks still just about Well,
mind. That looks still just about Well,
no, the score is lower, but it's going
no, the score is lower, but it's going
up. Well, to be fair, you like there are
up. Well, to be fair, you like there are
way more really bad starting positions,
way more really bad starting positions,
I think, than like really good ones. If
I think, than like really good ones. If
you start near the ghost, you're just
you start near the ghost, you're just
screwed.
Ghosts definitely need to move a bit
Ghosts definitely need to move a bit
slower when uh after you've eaten the
slower when uh after you've eaten the
pills or I don't think the game is
pills or I don't think the game is
solvable otherwise.
solvable otherwise.
Yeah, it might not be solvable all the
Yeah, it might not be solvable all the
time at least.
But we can see what this
does. It's definitely harder than actual
does. It's definitely harder than actual
Pac-Man if they don't slow
down. It's actually kind of insane how
down. It's actually kind of insane how
well this is working.
well this is working.
Um, I don't know how long you've been
Um, I don't know how long you've been
around reinforcement learning. This is
around reinforcement learning. This is
not a thing that existed a few months
not a thing that existed a few months

Yeah, that that's rough. I I believe it
Yeah, that that's rough. I I believe it
though.
It's all this darn field.
Okay. So, is it randomizing it like once
Okay. So, is it randomizing it like once
per end or something?

Should be per episode. Different

Oh, no, it is. It's just the animation's
Oh, no, it is. It's just the animation's
not updating.
not updating.
Yep. I think it's I think it's
Yep. I think it's I think it's
If you go
If you go
to I've got a quick fix. Um, if you just
to I've got a quick fix. Um, if you just
render them at their current position
render them at their current position
and like cut out that
and like cut out that
lurp, I think it'll work.
You won't get the smooth animation, but
You won't get the smooth animation, but
you'll actually see where where it is.
you'll actually see where where it is.
At least just pause.
You could also set progress to one and
You could also set progress to one and
that might work
too. If this because I think progress is
too. If this because I think progress is
staying at
staying at
zero. That could be part of the problem.
Fix the lurp.
I like having the Pac-Man with the
I like having the Pac-Man with the
puffer. the Pac-Man.
invalid from vector 2 to I vector 2. Oh
invalid from vector 2 to I vector 2. Oh
man. Oh yeah, that's rough.
man. Oh yeah, that's rough.
I vector two. might be the the simplest
I vector two. might be the the simplest
thing is just set progress to one like
thing is just set progress to one like
see that float
progress. I think that'll also
progress. I think that'll also
effectively stop lurping if progress is
effectively stop lurping if progress is
one.
Back
puff. There he is. Oh no. Wait. Did he
puff. There he is. Oh no. Wait. Did he
just go through the wall? Uh, I don't
just go through the wall? Uh, I don't
think he's supposed to do
think he's supposed to do
that. Well, I think the lurp stuff is
that. Well, I think the lurp stuff is
still wrong.
Yeah,
it's like it's not
it's like it's not
lurping the one axis like it's one of
lurping the one axis like it's one of
the
the
coordinates. It looked like he was doing

like y axis but not x
like y axis but not x
axis. Oh,
axis. Oh,
did I miss one?
What is this slurp supposed to be?
It it just
It it just
like displays the
position in between the their last
position in between the their last
location and their current
location and their current
location based on the progress like the
location based on the progress like the
percentage of
percentage of

And I would just do it like pick a
And I would just do it like pick a
number of frames per
number of frames per
step. Just do it fixed. Let me see if I
step. Just do it fixed. Let me see if I
can get that working for you real quick.
Yeah, I think maybe if you set it to one
Yeah, I think maybe if you set it to one
there that would work. I think I can do
progress
frame.
Um, hang on. I've done this twice this
Um, hang on. I've done this twice this
week.
Maybe this.
Well, this kind of this kind of requires
Well, this kind of this kind of requires
you to do
Oh, I think I see the other issue
Oh, I think I see the other issue
though.

Um, because it's updating the previous
Um, because it's updating the previous
alert

That's the problem.
Where? But you
could you might be able to do like if
could you might be able to do like if
frame equals zero call the update lurp
frame equals zero call the update lurp
position like I think that I think

that's
that's
happening in the top level
happening in the top level

If wait update
lurp this thing. Yeah, update
lurp this thing. Yeah, update
interpolation. I can I can definitely

fix all this stuff. Um,
fix all this stuff. Um,
see I want to see the thing go.
see I want to see the thing go.
I I see that I see I've done it in a a
I I see that I see I've done it in a a
bad way. Now,
bad way. Now,
I would look at like the way that we do
I would look at like the way that we do
it in uh in MOA or in um neural MMO is
it in uh in MOA or in um neural MMO is
neural MMO has tile based like
animations. Can I just do this? Does
animations. Can I just do this? Does
this work? I think if you do that,
this work? I think if you do that,
you'll definitely see it. Like it might
you'll definitely see it. Like it might
not interpolate, but they'll be in the
not interpolate, but they'll be in the
right
right
places, which would I think that's good
places, which would I think that's good
enough.
Hey, buffer.
Hey, buffer.
Nice.
Nice.
Yeah, he's trying, but it's freaking
Yeah, he's trying, but it's freaking
hard when they don't slow down. Mhm.
I'd be surprised if the M's beatable.
I mean like actually what do you do
I mean like actually what do you do
right?
Like okay like like what do I do here
Like okay like like what do I do here
right?
Now they're coming for me.
Now they're coming for me.
Yeah, I think you're done.
Yep. I can't even [ __ ] eat any of

It's probably too

impossible. Probably dependent on
impossible. Probably dependent on
starting position though, if that's the
starting position though, if that's the
case and ghost delays and all that.
Yes, it's very hard.
It's reliant. I think the the game is
It's reliant. I think the the game is
reliant on you being able to bait them
reliant on you being able to bait them
to the power

I have built in already that I just
I have built in already that I just
haven't bothered with like
But the arcade the arcade rules were
But the arcade the arcade rules were
better. And then for Atari, Miss Pac-Man
better. And then for Atari, Miss Pac-Man
was but like more like the arcade

can I just do
this VM? Oh, come on.
Ah, darn. It doesn't render through uh
Ah, darn. It doesn't render through uh

Let me push these fixes for you. And

then I got to go back to my lucrative

guess.
All right, there you go. So, we have
All right, there you go. So, we have
Yeah, thanks. I mean, yeah, we got your

you know, running sweeps and like tuning
you know, running sweeps and like tuning
this and tuning that and then we kind of

just I kind of just like added a better

works. Nice. It's awesome.
works. Nice. It's awesome.
That was fun. Very cool. So, I think you
That was fun. Very cool. So, I think you
I think you know um if you can make the
I think you know um if you can make the
ghost look, I don't want to make you
ghost look, I don't want to make you
spend tons and tons of time on this Z
spend tons and tons of time on this Z
because you sound like you're pretty
because you sound like you're pretty
busy. And there's also if you want to do
busy. And there's also if you want to do
RL stuff, there's also tons of other
RL stuff, there's also tons of other
stuff that you can do in here with
stuff that you can do in here with
different M's and like, you know, I want
different M's and like, you know, I want
to keep stuff interesting. So, if you

have to work and um maybe like I don't

know if you can make the ghost be slower
know if you can make the ghost be slower
or like
or like
something, but they've got to be nerfed
something, but they've got to be nerfed
somehow while they're
somehow while they're
um in power pill like when you get the
um in power pill like when you get the
power pill so that you can actually eat
power pill so that you can actually eat
them. Cuz otherwise I think that the
them. Cuz otherwise I think that the
whole point of
whole point of
Pac-Man is that you're supposed to be
Pac-Man is that you're supposed to be
able to like eat a bunch of stuff and
able to like eat a bunch of stuff and
then bait them to the power pill, right?
then bait them to the power pill, right?
Yeah. Yeah, totally. No. Isn't that
Yeah. Yeah, totally. No. Isn't that
That's how it works, right? Like if you
That's how it works, right? Like if you
like
like
No, you I want to get the actual game
No, you I want to get the actual game
because I haven't like played it.
Why are they all so
Why are they all so
loud? Okay, I can mute it.
Okay. Is it just Are the ghosts your
Okay. Is it just Are the ghosts your
same speed?
same speed?
They're a little faster,
They're a little faster,
but I think it depends on the level
but I think it depends on the level
you're on.
you're on.
Look at that. So, it pauses. I eat
Look at that. So, it pauses. I eat
freaking three of them,
right? And now they're so much slower.
Look at
that. And I'm dead. But I also You get
that. And I'm dead. But I also You get
five lives to complete this one level
five lives to complete this one level
usually. Mhm.
I'm sure you would get it if I had
I'm sure you would get it if I had
multiple lives, too. Doing it on one
multiple lives, too. Doing it on one
life with fast scared ghosts is is uh is
life with fast scared ghosts is is uh is
a lot
harder. Okay, so I just got the first
harder. Okay, so I just got the first
stage with two lives, right? after
stage with two lives, right? after
having tried it several times on the
having tried it several times on the
other
other
version and then it's like is it this
version and then it's like is it this
does the level ever get harder or is it
does the level ever get harder or is it
just you do the same damn thing
just you do the same damn thing
repeatedly?

It does get harder. Um how
It does get harder. Um how
the they stay frightened for less

I mean, you could pretty easily just add

It's actually like mechanically kind of
It's actually like mechanically kind of
snappy.
Okay. So, yeah, it's
definitely What's
this, huh? Oh, it just gives you this
this, huh? Oh, it just gives you this
weird animation.
Why does it feel easier here? It's like,
Why does it feel easier here? It's like,
is the ghost

Great. All right,
Great. All right,
cool. All right. Well, congratulations
cool. All right. Well, congratulations
uh on your first NPR. If you can clean
uh on your first NPR. If you can clean
up a few things, I think that'll be a
up a few things, I think that'll be a
very nice uh addition. We like to have
very nice uh addition. We like to have
some of these these classic arcade
some of these these classic arcade
games. Let's see how it looks at the
games. Let's see how it looks at the
moment. I actually wasn't really even
moment. I actually wasn't really even
paying attention to how it looks. I was
paying attention to how it looks. I was
just kind of like trying to get it
solved. Do one very small
solved. Do one very small
thing. Well, can I do you mind if I uh I
thing. Well, can I do you mind if I uh I
tweak the base pallet just a tiny bit?
tweak the base pallet just a tiny bit?
Leave the ghost. Yeah, go for it.
Leave the ghost. Yeah, go for it.
Totally. You can you can tweak anything.
Totally. You can you can tweak anything.
It's your project. Well, I like to be
It's your project. Well, I like to be
somewhat respectful, you know, to the
somewhat respectful, you know, to the

is
We have a pallet kind and I draw things
We have a pallet kind and I draw things

Yeah. Just clicks.
You might be able to use the bucket tool

even if it's not

[ __ ] Surely the most efficient way

is to select pixels one at a time in the

It's actually editing the binary
It's actually editing the binary
manually. That's that's the most
manually. That's that's the most
efficient. You know, it wouldn't be that
efficient. You know, it wouldn't be that
much slower at this point.
And now this is the hard
one. Yeah.
one. Yeah.
No,
No,
this
this
think. Oh, man. I'm going to have to
think. Oh, man. I'm going to have to
copy the last one, I
think. How do we copy?
coffee.
Oh,
okay. Nice. That looks good.
Almost. Can I get it?
Almost. Can I get it?
Nice.
Nice.
Nice. Now that background
Nice. Now that background
um transparent.
um transparent.
Uh what about the one at the bottom
Uh what about the one at the bottom
left? Is that transparent too or am I
left? Is that transparent too or am I
Yeah, I think
Yeah, I think
so. Yeah, I mean looks like
Let's see if this actually does anything
Let's see if this actually does anything
after all that.
Oh, that's looks like Puffer Pac-Man to
Oh, that's looks like Puffer Pac-Man to
me. Nice.
me. Nice.
I'm actually proud of that. That looks
I'm actually proud of that. That looks
like it. Yeah, I'm actually proud of
like it. Yeah, I'm actually proud of
that. That's good.
Very
Very
cool. Just need to get the
cool. Just need to get the
intribulations working the right way.
intribulations working the right way.
Right. Yeah. I can't get you interps.
Right. Yeah. I can't get you interps.
But I did
But I did
uh I think that's pretty solid.
uh I think that's pretty solid.
Mhm. Yeah, I'm happy with that.
There you
There you
are. So I contributed
are. So I contributed
uh we also add the uh other colors the
uh we also add the uh other colors the
background color.
We like to try to keep everything just
We like to try to keep everything just
slightly puffer themed.
slightly puffer themed.
Nice. And uh yeah, that'll be cool. So,
Nice. And uh yeah, that'll be cool. So,
I think if you fix the interpolation and
I think if you fix the interpolation and
you do it without timing, if you do it
you do it without timing, if you do it
like based on frame or whatever, it will
like based on frame or whatever, it will
also be able to just be way easier to
also be able to just be way easier to
toss on the website. Sweet. Cuz I what I
toss on the website. Sweet. Cuz I what I
would like to do, my goal is I would
would like to do, my goal is I would
like to have everybody as new MS. I
like to have everybody as new MS. I
don't know what the heck happened here.
don't know what the heck happened here.
Oh, no. This is fine. It's just that
Oh, no. This is fine. It's just that
there are only a few tiles left. Um, I
there are only a few tiles left. Um, I
want to have everybody's M on here. I
want to have everybody's M on here. I
think by current count, we should have
think by current count, we should have
22 environments for the release. Nice.
Nice be. Uh, it should be good. Hey, we
Nice be. Uh, it should be good. Hey, we
have nine people online. Welcome
have nine people online. Welcome
everyone. This is uh open source ultra
everyone. This is uh open source ultra
hyper reinforcement learning stuff.
hyper reinforcement learning stuff.
um build some environments with
us. What time is it? Nine.

I still have to launch a couple
I still have to launch a couple
quicks.

Uh this this other new one I think is
Uh this this other new one I think is
also going to be really nice. This
also going to be really nice. This
um
um
target I want to do way more with stuff
target I want to do way more with stuff
that looks like this. Oh yeah, also the
that looks like this. Oh yeah, also the
the C doesn't work perfectly. This is
the C doesn't work perfectly. This is
supposed to be the policy loaded into C.
supposed to be the policy loaded into C.
and it like kind of works, but I think
and it like kind of works, but I think
that there's like some there's some
that there's like some there's some
small
small
errors because the the PyTorch version
errors because the the PyTorch version
is way better.
Are there any numerical precision
Are there any numerical precision
differences between torch and C? There's
differences between torch and C? There's
probably I screwed or that or I screwed
probably I screwed or that or I screwed
something else up, right?
Um, yeah, I screwed I just screwed
Um, yeah, I screwed I just screwed
something up for sure.
All right, I think I'm going to hop off,
All right, I think I'm going to hop off,
but thank you very much for the you get
but thank you very much for the you get
those things in. That'll be uh that'll
those things in. That'll be uh that'll
be great. And I will be very happy to
be great. And I will be very happy to
have Pac-Man in Puffer. Sweet. Thank
have Pac-Man in Puffer. Sweet. Thank
you. All right, have a good one. Yeah.
you. All right, have a good one. Yeah.
See you.
See you.
Let me get this. Let me make sure I can
Let me get this. Let me make sure I can
actually run this thing plasma and then
actually run this thing plasma and then
uh we will take a look at
your Ah, I see what happened.
I'm going to keep watching this on the

Let me let me Y
you're on.
you're on.
I hope so. Basically, um I have these
I hope so. Basically, um I have these
tun tunable parameters. And right now,
tun tunable parameters. And right now,
um basically I only turned on the one
um basically I only turned on the one
that discourages it from going into the

corners. And for some reason like most
corners. And for some reason like most
policies I train basically like every

one of them love the quarter and I also
one of them love the quarter and I also
like switch to recurrent because it
like switch to recurrent because it
works now.
works now.
Okay. Um I mean if you if you PR like an
Okay. Um I mean if you if you PR like an
initial version I can just like fiddle
initial version I can just like fiddle
with it. I can see um here I think I
with it. I can see um here I think I
pushed Yeah. Everything Wait, let me
Is it Syon or binding?
Is it Syon or binding?
Uh, normal. The C binding, the new one.
Uh, normal. The C binding, the new one.
That's nice. That's less work for me.
That's nice. That's less work for me.
Mhm. I've done enough work. Lord

be good now. You know, if you look at my
be good now. You know, if you look at my

Oh yeah, you have
this one.
this one.
Uh, voids in in progress. That one.

First of all, let's actually look at
First of all, let's actually look at
your
your
code. New PRS
2 is 4096, right? Yeah, that's correct.
I can't get the ramp to work. And that's
I can't get the ramp to work. And that's
not
ultimate. Is everything good? And
But
yeah. Oh, I know how we're going to fix
yeah. Oh, I know how we're going to fix
this for
this for
sure. Okay.
Yeah, for
Yeah, for
sure. Okay. Oh, should I copy that? No,
sure. Okay. Oh, should I copy that? No,
you're fine. Let me
just have 30. Okay. 300 line files.
just have 30. Okay. 300 line files.
Really, really pretty.
Yeah, a lot of it is just constants,
Yeah, a lot of it is just constants,
strcts. Yeah, you should take a look at
strcts. Yeah, you should take a look at
the new target code as well as a
the new target code as well as a
reference. I made it really clean.
Yeah, I still have some like stuff I
Yeah, I still have some like stuff I
probably should just like remove or
probably should just like remove or
something like that. But you're like the
something like that. But you're like the
thing is it's going to always be worse
thing is it's going to always be worse
when you're like deving and confused on
when you're like deving and confused on
how to get the thing to train. Like let
how to get the thing to train. Like let
me help you with that and then you can
me help you with that and then you can
clean it up. I would like to have I
clean it up. I would like to have I
would like to have this one clean
would like to have this one clean
because I actually want to do more
because I actually want to do more
particle based stuff and this like Mhm.
particle based stuff and this like Mhm.
really nice reference.
really nice reference.
Yeah, particle base will be really cool.
Yeah, particle base will be really cool.
It'll be really cool to do a lot with
It'll be really cool to do a lot with
that. what you did with the target but
that. what you did with the target but
for continuous which I'm guessing that
for continuous which I'm guessing that
one looked it is it looked uh the
one looked it is it looked uh the
actions aren't continuous but the only
actions aren't continuous but the only
reason the action the actions are
reason the action the actions are
discretized
discretized
um but the the state is continuous
um but the the state is continuous
by state what do you mean the position
by state what do you mean the position
the positions
the positions
yeah I see well I guess the actions cuz
yeah I see well I guess the actions cuz
it looked like the actions were very you
it looked like the actions were very you
know They weren't very smooth. The only
know They weren't very smooth. The only
reason that they're discretized is
reason that they're discretized is
because uh we have continuous actions.
because uh we have continuous actions.
They seem way way worse to train.
They seem way way worse to train.
Yeah, I have continuous actions.
Yeah, I have continuous actions.
Oh, we're going to Yeah, that's
why. Why don't I just merge this, fix
why. Why don't I just merge this, fix
it, and then I'll give you a full code
it, and then I'll give you a full code
review when you're ready to actually
review when you're ready to actually
submit the code. Okay.
submit the code. Okay.
Um, is that okay? What What do you mean?
Um, is that okay? What What do you mean?
Like Oh, like you want to like So I Why
Like Oh, like you want to like So I Why
don't I help you? Why don't Why don't I
don't I help you? Why don't Why don't I
spend the time getting this to train
spend the time getting this to train
with you tonight? So I'll merge it and
with you tonight? So I'll merge it and
then when you're ready to like have the
then when you're ready to like have the
final version, I'll do a full code
final version, I'll do a full code
review for you. Oh, okay. So like So
review for you. Oh, okay. So like So
everyone review I do a full code review
everyone review I do a full code review
for everyone when they submit an end.
for everyone when they submit an end.
But what I'm saying is that I'll still
But what I'm saying is that I'll still
do that, but why don't I just help you
do that, but why don't I just help you
get it to work for now? Yeah. Yeah, that
get it to work for now? Yeah. Yeah, that
sounds
good. [ __ ]

wasn't able to train. Uh
well score basically score right now the
well score basically score right now the
user log score is average reward of all
user log score is average reward of all
the voids.
and not that, right? Yeah, that's the
and not that, right? Yeah, that's the
exact opposite of what it should do.
exact opposite of what it should do.
Yeah, because um right now if you kept
Yeah, because um right now if you kept
the config the same, I basically only
the config the same, I basically only
turned on the corners. So basically the
turned on the corners. So basically the
way this agent gets negative reward is
way this agent gets negative reward is
by going to to like to the corners.
Oh, what is the observations?
Oh, what is the observations?
Uh, the observations are the x y vx vy.
Uh, the observations are the x y vx vy.
Oh, that'sed.
Oh, really? Yes, absolutely.
Oh, really? Yes, absolutely.
Okay, good point. And what is it? Is it
Okay, good point. And what is it? Is it
like size? Is the map size there? Like
like size? Is the map size there? Like
map size? Yes, there is a width and
map size? Yes, there is a width and
height.
It's in the client. Is it in the end?
It's in the client. Is it in the end?
I don't think so. No. How do you how do
I don't think so. No. How do you how do
you do do bounce detection in the end?
you do do bounce detection in the end?
In the
In the
end. Um in the step I
end. Um in the step I
have. Yeah. Well, that's the thing. The
have. Yeah. Well, that's the thing. The
right here, right? This is a capital
right here, right? This is a capital
width. Yep. It's the It's the constants.
width. Yep. It's the It's the constants.
Fine. All right. So, we'll do Yeah, I
Fine. All right. So, we'll do Yeah, I
should I can It's probably better. I
should I can It's probably better. I
should probably have width and height.
should probably have width and height.
Velocity. Uh, yes. Uh, I think it's
Velocity. Uh, yes. Uh, I think it's
called a velocity cap. Exactly.
called a velocity cap. Exactly.
Right now, it's three, but again,
Right now, it's three, but again,
we can do that.
We're going to see if I can magically
We're going to see if I can magically
solve all your problems today. Mhm.
solve all your problems today. Mhm.
I'm usually quite decent at that.
I'm usually quite decent at that.
So what's um why I guess what's the
So what's um why I guess what's the
logic behind
logic behind
um I guess um normalizing observations
um I guess um normalizing observations
neural nets don't like
is it that's seriously it neural nets
is it that's seriously it neural nets
don't like big numbers right so you
don't like big numbers right so you
normalize it just because it goes into
normalize it just because it goes into
the neural net as an input and I guess
the neural net as an input and I guess
if it was just, you know, for the like
if it was just, you know, for the like
uh just for the env logic or the uh it
uh just for the env logic or the uh it
doesn't matter exactly. Okay. Yeah,
that looks different, doesn't it? That
that looks different, doesn't it? That
looks really good. That's very different
looks really good. That's very different
from what you've had, huh? 100%. Okay,
from what you've had, huh? 100%. Okay,
so you only two fixes.
so you only two fixes.
So you normalized observations, right?
So you normalized observations, right?
And I discret and I discretized your
And I discret and I discretized your
actions though. We can try it with uh
actions though. We can try it with uh
continuous but from my initial like my
continuous but from my initial like my
tests on other environments continuous
tests on other environments continuous
has looked not so good.
has looked not so good.
Can we just try it and see how it looks?
Can we just try it and see how it looks?
We
We
can. But yeah, that looks good. That
can. But yeah, that looks good. That
looks really good.
looks really good.
Well, and I guess what do you think then
Well, and I guess what do you think then
of I guess so is there a plan to make
of I guess so is there a plan to make
continuous actions good? Well, I the
continuous actions good? Well, I the
thing is I don't necessarily know it's a
thing is I don't necessarily know it's a
bug and puffer. It could just be that
bug and puffer. It could just be that
it's [ __ ] hard to learn.
it's [ __ ] hard to learn.
H Are there any research papers do
H Are there any research papers do
talking about discrete versus continuous
talking about discrete versus continuous
actions? Well, we kind of know that
actions? Well, we kind of know that
continuous is a total mess and uh this
continuous is a total mess and uh this
is a good chance that this is why. And I
is a good chance that this is why. And I
also know that there are researchers who
also know that there are researchers who
prefer not using continuous. That said,
prefer not using continuous. That said,
this looks like it's learned just fine
this looks like it's learned just fine
in this case. Well, yeah. Let's see.
in this case. Well, yeah. Let's see.
Let's see. This has learned uh just fine
Let's see. This has learned uh just fine
with I believe this continuous. The
with I believe this continuous. The
score looks good. This is totally fine.
score looks good. This is totally fine.
So,
So,
um let's let's see the eval of it
maybe. I mean, it's really on like
maybe. I mean, it's really on like
longer runs what happens. It's just very
longer runs what happens. It's just very
unstable what I've seen.
Okay. Let's see. Okay. Yeah, they're
Okay. Let's see. Okay. Yeah, they're
Yes. Okay.
Yes. Okay.
So, it is working. They're vibing. Yeah.
So, it is working. They're vibing. Yeah.
Nice. It was literally just your data,
Nice. It was literally just your data,
norm. I should add that. Yeah. It was
norm. I should add that. Yeah. It was
just my observations. Yeah. Let me just
just my observations. Yeah. Let me just
do that real quick.
do that real quick.
Yeah. Okay. That that that makes sense.
Yeah. Okay. That that that makes sense.
That totally makes sense. I for I
That totally makes sense. I for I
totally forgot about observation
normalization. Oh, do you have it
there? Oh, no. Oh, this is the new guide
there? Oh, no. Oh, this is the new guide
I'm writing. Oh, I thought I thought you
I'm writing. Oh, I thought I thought you
had it in there and you were going to be
had it in there and you were going to be
like, just read the docs, please. You
like, just read the docs, please. You
know, read the damn manual.
know, read the damn manual.
Oh, actually I did add it to the recent
one. Oh, I do have it here. I actually
one. Oh, I do have it here. I actually
already had it in the the new the new
already had it in the the new the new
guide. Oh,
guide. Oh,
but this isn't pushed yet. Normalize. I
but this isn't pushed yet. Normalize. I
did actually write that as part of the
did actually write that as part of the
checklist. Mhm. There you go. I'm
checklist. Mhm. There you go. I'm
predicting I'm predicting your errors.
predicting I'm predicting your errors.
Yeah. Um I guess now let's turn on all
Yeah. Um I guess now let's turn on all
the Yeah. How do I do it? Is it just in
the Yeah. How do I do it? Is it just in
the config? It's in in it's just in the
the config? It's in in it's just in the
in
file. Yeah. I I made it so that we can
file. Yeah. I I made it so that we can
sweep them later. So these factors can
sweep them later. So these factors can
put them to whatever you want. Yeah.
Well, they don't like that.
Well, they don't like that.
What? Oh, we'll see. We'll see. It's a
What? Oh, we'll see. We'll see. It's a
lot more. Ah, actually, yeah, your your
lot more. Ah, actually, yeah, your your
your normalization your reward
your normalization your reward
normalization is off now. So, yes, it's
normalization is off now. So, yes, it's
not going to work. Is the reward off?
not going to work. Is the reward off?
Uh, yeah, now it is cuz um it's not
Uh, yeah, now it is cuz um it's not
dynamically normalized. It just, you
dynamically normalized. It just, you
know, I just divided by two in uh that
know, I just divided by two in uh that
case. So, you can four. That's fine. Oh,
case. So, you can four. That's fine. Oh,
but look to nan.
That's bad.
Yeah, probably exploded cuz the
um the other rewards
um the other rewards
are more than four. They're like, yeah,
are more than four. They're like, yeah,
you probably we clip.
you probably we clip.
You shouldn't be able to break our uh
You shouldn't be able to break our uh
our train that easily.
Okay. Well, we we'll try a few different
Okay. Well, we we'll try a few different
things. I'll show
things. I'll show
you to just do some experiment food
you to just do some experiment food
today.
today.
Mhm. All right. So, this is no good.
Mhm. All right. So, this is no good.
Yeah. Says them's not the puffers.
Yeah. Says them's not the puffers.
Yeah. They're not puffering. Them not
Yeah. They're not puffering. Them not
the puffers, you know. Uh, so this avoid
the puffers, you know. Uh, so this avoid
one's probably pretty easy.
Yeah, that just means they should be
Yeah, that just means they should be
just running away from each other
just running away from each other
scared like they seen a demon
scared like they seen a demon
is max zero.
is max zero.
Yes, that's that. Yeah, with this one.
Yes, that's that. Yeah, with this one.
Yes. The only uh one I add to is the
Yes. The only uh one I add to is the
um
um
the margins reward. I'm thinking like I
the margins reward. I'm thinking like I
was going through this and thinking of
was going through this and thinking of
how I can add it so that I just don't I
how I can add it so that I just don't I
don't just p penalize I also
don't just p penalize I also
incentivize.
Whoa. Okay. They don't seem to be
Whoa. Okay. They don't seem to be
avoiding each other. So that reward
avoiding each other. So that reward
doesn't seem to be I wouldn't expect
doesn't seem to be I wouldn't expect
that to be zero.
They're puffering.
They're puffering.
Well, kind of. Yeah. Um
So that one is kind of very simple. I
So that one is kind of very simple. I
just
um I just basically calculate
um I just basically calculate
how if they're in the protected zone,
how if they're in the protected zone,
how how far away they are from the um
how how far away they are from the um
void, like how close they are to the
void, like how close they are to the
edge of the protected zone. and I kind
edge of the protected zone. and I kind
of um Oh, that's not avoiding. Okay, so
of um Oh, that's not avoiding. Okay, so
that's
that's
just what's
um Okay, we have to actually figure out
um Okay, we have to actually figure out
what are what are some intuitive ones
what are what are some intuitive ones
that we like know what it should do. Um
that we like know what it should do. Um
I mean, yeah, pro um protected one is
I mean, yeah, pro um protected one is
pretty intuitive in the sense of like um
pretty intuitive in the sense of like um
this is avoiding the edge, I guess,
this is avoiding the edge, I guess,
right? No. Uh so so the margin is the
right? No. Uh so so the margin is the
one that avoids the edge. The avoid
one that avoids the edge. The avoid
factor avoids each other. They like try
factor avoids each other. They like try
to avoid each. Okay. They're not doing
to avoid each. Okay. They're not doing
that, right? Yes. That's the issue. Um
that, right? Yes. That's the issue. Um
so h so right now I'm only penalizing
so h so right now I'm only penalizing
them based on if they are in the
them based on if they are in the
protected zone or not. What's the
protected zone or not. What's the
protected zone?
protected zone?
Uh it's you see how you have the
Uh it's you see how you have the
um so the reward is calculated in the
um so the reward is calculated in the
number is less than protected range.
number is less than protected range.
It's just the number of voids that are
It's just the number of voids that are
two plus. Okay. So here this is what
two plus. Okay. So here this is what
we'll do.
we'll do.
It's yeah but it I'm also calculating
It's yeah but it I'm also calculating
I'm calculating how close they are to
I'm calculating how close they are to
the edge and the closer they are the
the edge and the closer they are the
less penalized. They can't see each
less penalized. They can't see each
other right? Or can they can they see
other right? Or can they can they see
each other? They can't see each other.
Well, what do you Well, they do. I mean,
Well, what do you Well, they do. I mean,
they kind of the the policy sees all of
they kind of the the policy sees all of
them and No, it doesn't.
them and No, it doesn't.
They the policy sees the observations of
They the policy sees the observations of
Oh, you're
Oh, you're
saying Are you saying that? Okay. Maybe
saying Are you saying that? Okay. Maybe
literally they can't see each other.
literally they can't see each other.
So is the observations array just means
So is the observations array just means
that the um it's not just one policy.
that the um it's not just one policy.
It's not just like one input to one
It's not just like one input to one
policy. It's each one of those
policy. It's each one of those
xyvx y.
xyvx y.
So this here so this voids index this
So this here so this voids index this
data here is what the first void will
data here is what the first void will
see.
see.
And then on index one that's what the
And then on index one that's what the
second void will see.
second void will see.
I see. Okay, that's not what I had in
I see. Okay, that's not what I had in
mind. What I had in mind is to basically
mind. What I had in mind is to basically
have one network seeing everything and
have one network seeing everything and
managing everything. Well, you can do
managing everything. Well, you can do
that.
that.
Would that just mean I just basically
Would that just mean I just basically
flatten the array? Well, what you would
flatten the array? Well, what you would
do here? No, you'd need to do you need
do here? No, you'd need to do you need
to do another loop. Um,
we can do it real quick. Okay. So,
Okay. Okay.
Oh, you're just going to
Okay. Ward is affected by their puffers.
Okay. Ward is affected by their puffers.
Observations need to be and are not
Observations need to be and are not
yet. This is what we're do.
Well, they just I don't think see each
Well, they just I don't think see each
other
other
like they second they don't observe each
like they second they don't observe each
other but now hopefully they
do. The reward though is affected by the
do. The reward though is affected by the
other puffers because the reward is
other puffers because the reward is
basically calculating for each puffer.
basically calculating for each puffer.
It's looking at all the other puffers
It's looking at all the other puffers
and calculating the
reward. This might be hard for her to
reward. This might be hard for her to
learn. We will see.
There's the first pass. Now we have to
There's the first pass. Now we have to
actually
um do like
um do like
obsess. I can Oh yeah, you need to muck
obsess. I can Oh yeah, you need to muck
it correctly. I guess I can do.
Okay, we do this.
Okay, we do this.
Yeah. And then you do the same thing
Yeah. And then you do the same thing
when you well I guess we don't need to
when you well I guess we don't need to
we don't need to allocate them because
we don't need to allocate them because
we're passing them from the Python. So
we're passing them from the Python. So
we're fix to see after. I just want I
we're fix to see after. I just want I
just want to I want to get you something
just want to I want to get you something
that actually works. Mhm.
the other thing is the the score doesn't
the other thing is the the score doesn't
seem to be computed well.
Um the score is basically the average
reward. So that's yeah you have the
reward. So that's yeah you have the
current reward for each step for each
current reward for each step for each
like
like
um iteration and then the
Okay. In pixels, isn't it? Uh, yes.
Okay. In pixels, isn't it? Uh, yes.
Yeah. Two is nothing.
Well, I guess.
There we go.
Okay. Yeah. Here we go. I don't know if
Okay. Yeah. Here we go. I don't know if
it's rain. Mhm. We'll see. And we can
it's rain. Mhm. We'll see. And we can
probably, you
probably, you
know, we can um That's going to be hard.
Maybe we can increase the screen range
Maybe we can increase the screen range
and then have them like the screen size.
and then have them like the screen size.
Oh, there's so much stuff we so much
Oh, there's so much stuff we so much
stuff we can do here, man. you
know. Oh, and those margin turn factor,
know. Oh, and those margin turn factor,
centering factor, all those stuff you
centering factor, all those stuff you
can delete because we're uh getting them
can delete because we're uh getting them
from the config. So all those uh define
from the config. So all those uh define
factors, pound define factors, you can
factors, pound define factors, you can
totally remove
totally remove
the factors. Oh, okay. So that the
the factors. Oh, okay. So that the
define margin turn factor that one you
define margin turn factor that one you
you can remove all those because they're
you can remove all those because they're
gotten from the you know from the avoids
gotten from the you know from the avoids
in
any n
Yeah, those lines can be formatted
better. Okay,
is everything is just moving too slow.
is everything is just moving too slow.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
It's really hard to learn if it takes a
It's really hard to learn if it takes a
million frames to do anything. Ah, so
million frames to do anything. Ah, so
you're saying
you're saying
Yes. So, there you go. See, immediately
Yes. So, there you go. See, immediately
I just made it learn better by just
I just made it learn better by just
making everything go faster.
making everything go faster.
And you mean by like the voids having
And you mean by like the voids having
the control to go faster.
the control to go faster.
So, let's see what this looks like. Then
So, let's see what this looks like. Then
you can probably remove the cap. Like
you can probably remove the cap. Like
you can increase the caps. I did. Oh,
you can increase the caps. I did. Oh,
you
you
did? Oh,
okay. Let's
see. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Cool. Right.
see. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Cool. Right.
Yeah. They're they're trying to avoid
Yeah. They're they're trying to avoid
each other. I can kind of see
that. Yeah. Damn. They're going fast
that. Yeah. Damn. They're going fast
though. That's kind of It's cool, right?
though. That's kind of It's cool, right?
Um Yeah. It just It's very chaotic.
Yeah, it's cool. Um
Yeah, it's cool. Um
you pass these heights in. You don't,
you pass these heights in. You don't,
right? Oh, yeah. I can make them uh
right? Oh, yeah. I can make them uh
configurable. You don't have to. I just
configurable. You don't have to. I just
wanted to.
wanted to.
It's cuz you don't want to have to build
It's cuz you don't want to have to build
over and over, you know? That's uh the
over and over, you know? That's uh the
power of having a lot of these variables
power of having a lot of these variables
configurable like in the Well, this is
configurable like in the Well, this is
just my build system's just stupid. It
just my build system's just stupid. It
should literally take 4 seconds. It
should literally take 4 seconds. It
should take like 3 seconds to build.
Right now, you just have a lot of you're
Right now, you just have a lot of you're
just building a lot of environments.
just building a lot of environments.
Yeah, you should just be able to build
Yeah, you should just be able to build
the one. Mhm.
the one. Mhm.
like make it so that it's it's kind of
like make it so that it's it's kind of
like make where if nothing changed,
like make where if nothing changed,
don't compile it. That should just be CC
don't compile it. That should just be CC
cache.
cache.
Yeah.
Um, if you want to look at the hang on
Um, if you want to look at the hang on
this is
protected
by Hang Hang on. How does this make
by Hang Hang on. How does this make
sense?
sense?
Um, it's just the average. It's just So
Um, it's just the average. It's just So
the average since I'm only
the average since I'm only
uh Wait. Yeah. Let me looks wrong. Let
uh Wait. Yeah. Let me looks wrong. Let
me try something. Right. No, no, no. You
me try something. Right. No, no, no. You
can remove
can remove
the the absolute value.
What? Huh? No. So, so the protected
What? Huh? No. So, so the protected
distance sum is like
distance sum is like
it's it's a little more complicated than
it's it's a little more complicated than
just who is inside the protected range
just who is inside the protected range
versus who is not. It's not like a
versus who is not. It's not like a
binary. It's continuous. I made it so
binary. It's continuous. I made it so
that I see.
that I see.
Yeah. But like, yeah, because this is on
Yeah. But like, yeah, because this is on
zero. Um,
zero. Um,
so it's like if a lot of the voids are
so it's like if a lot of the voids are
in the protected range but are in the in
in the protected range but are in the in
like the edges of it in the perimeter,
like the edges of it in the perimeter,
um, it won't,
um, it won't,
um, it won't, I guess, but this doesn't
um, it won't, I guess, but this doesn't
like punish you as much.
like punish you as much.
So, if that makes sense. like like
So, if that makes sense. like like
the farther away a boy is from its uh
the farther away a boy is from its uh
from its basically the closer one um
from its basically the closer one um
another boy is to the current void the
another boy is to the current void the
higher the punishment the further away
higher the punishment the further away
it is from the from it but it's it can
it is from the from it but it's it can
still be in the protected range um of
still be in the protected range um of
course it's going to get um punished
course it's going to get um punished
less I'm confused why I have zero score
less I'm confused why I have zero score
here from this
uh I don't know that's uh maybe you have
uh I don't know that's uh maybe you have
no protected count
no protected count
which can see is the only way I don't
know it's probably going to be random I
know it's probably going to be random I
think
oh yeah okay that's the opposite they're
oh yeah okay that's the opposite they're
all grouped up Yeah. So protected
all grouped up Yeah. So protected
count if disc is less than protected
count if disc is less than protected
range this gets incremented
wait well that that one yeah but this
wait well that that one yeah but this
sum is
I'm confused this should shouldn't this
I'm confused this should shouldn't this
be they should be getting negative a ton
be they should be getting negative a ton
of reward.
So, um I do Yes, I do punish them. If
So, um I do Yes, I do punish them. If
you take a look at that, that's a minus
you take a look at that, that's a minus
equal. Oh, well. Yeah, you can make it.
equal. Oh, well. Yeah, you can make it.
I'm trying it. Thank you. Yeah, you can
I'm trying it. Thank you. Yeah, you can
make it. Oh, it doesn't seem I'm seeing
make it. Oh, it doesn't seem I'm seeing
zero score either way. Oh, is it just
zero score either way. Oh, is it just
not getting logged?
not getting logged?
[Music]
I think there's just
Nope. It was logging before. I don't
Nope. It was logging before. I don't
know. No, I think
should be getting logged. I don't know.
should be getting logged. I don't know.
Yeah, this is probably going to be the
Yeah, this is probably going to be the
same
result.
Yep. Yeah. Okay. So then this this has
Yep. Yeah. Okay. So then this this has
to be zero. this protected count.
to be zero. this protected count.
Uh yeah, I think you're just prot I
Uh yeah, I think you're just prot I
think the range is just not high enough.
think the range is just not high enough.
Maybe your range is I set your range to
Maybe your range is I set your range to
50.
Okay.
Okay.
Ah yeah.
Ah yeah.
Oh okay. I think I know why. So you know
Oh okay. I think I know why. So you know
well
um
um
the well so you know how kind of each
the well so you know how kind of each
void
void
the the point of it the x of and y of it
the the point of it the x of and y of it
is not in the center it's in the top
is not in the center it's in the top
left. Um, that might
left. Um, that might
be h that might be a reason, but I don't
be h that might be a reason, but I don't
know. I Why
know. I Why
is I mean I can you can take manual
is I mean I can you can take manual
control over them during eval and you
control over them during eval and you
can print the reward and see what it is,
can print the reward and see what it is,
but I have an idea.
[Music]
Okay. I thought that would be it.
Okay. I thought that would be it.
Yeah, I think you're just not getting
Yeah, I think you're just not getting
Did I really Did I rebuild it? I did.
Did I really Did I rebuild it? I did.
Maybe not. You did.
Maybe not. You did.
Okay.
Um I mean

The hardest part about making an

I've I've gotten a few environments
I've I've gotten a few environments
working in the last day or so. Bet.
Yeah, I would I would hope so, Joseph.
Yeah, I would I would hope so, Joseph.
Okay. No, there are protected count. Why
Okay. No, there are protected count. Why
is it not?
That was more for plasma versus for you.
That was more for plasma versus for you.
Yeah. Um, so the waste core gets

I just start logging stuff at this

to Puffer Lip.
Yeah, I still got a long way to go with
Yeah, I still got a long way to go with
these, but it takes time.
these, but it takes time.
All right, so what I'm learning a lot.
All right, so what I'm learning a lot.
Yeah, now score is still zero. So what
Yeah, now score is still zero. So what
do you what do you do with score?
do you what do you do with score?
Score I just set it to the um reward
Score I just set it to the um reward
that is calculated on the three lines
that is calculated on the three lines
above it. So the ends rewards current
above it. So the ends rewards current
index equals current void reward /
index equals current void reward /
two and just set it to that.
two and just set it to that.
And current void reward is what?
I see. It's
I see. It's
a complex calculation.
a complex calculation.
No, really. No, it's just average score
No, really. No, it's just average score
is just average. If that's what you're
is just average. If that's what you're
talking about,
maybe we should print current void
maybe we should print current void
reward. Oh, you have this as
uh some like dumb cast or some
uh some like dumb cast or some
ridiculous thing happening here is my
ridiculous thing happening here is my
guess.
guess.
Oh, Numbboys is unsigned. So,
Oh, Numbboys is unsigned. So,
does that get promoted?
Still zero. I don't think Oh, wait. No,
Still zero. I don't think Oh, wait. No,
there's the first zero now. Oh,
there's the first zero now. Oh,
okay. So, that might have been it. The
okay. So, that might have been it. The
plot thickens.
plot thickens.
Yeah, that definitely is uh is telling.
Yeah, that definitely is uh is telling.
It's something to do with current void
It's something to do with current void
reward or with that particular cast.
if one of your logging things gets uh
if one of your logging things gets uh
gets re, you know, recast as something.
gets re, you know, recast as something.
Okay, the score now is working. Let's
Okay, the score now is working. Let's
see if it learns.
And this is continuous actions, right?
And this is continuous actions, right?
No, I have it on discrete.
No, I have it on discrete.
Okay.
Okay.
So that I uh I checked the cart pole. So
So that I uh I checked the cart pole. So
with your args, it still trains. It's
with your args, it still trains. It's
not that I broke continuous actions.
not that I broke continuous actions.
It's just that they've always been worse
It's just that they've always been worse
than discreet. And because of the new
than discreet. And because of the new
optimizer changes, our new optimizer
optimizer changes, our new optimizer
like is able to get really aggressive
like is able to get really aggressive
hyperparams for discrete and
hyperparams for discrete and
multi-discreet, but for whatever reason,
multi-discreet, but for whatever reason,
you can't for continuous.
you can't for continuous.
Oh, okay. It's more subtle than just I
Oh, okay. It's more subtle than just I
screwed something up, I think. Okay,
screwed something up, I think. Okay,
good to know. The the the main issue
good to know. The the the main issue
with continuous was that that we would
with continuous was that that we would
just hit hard torch
just hit hard torch
errors. That was No, I fixed that. It's
errors. That was No, I fixed that. It's
it's numerically unstable. Okay. Well,
it's numerically unstable. Okay. Well,
yeah, thank you for telling me before
yeah, thank you for telling me before
I instead instead of uh saying, "Oh,
I instead instead of uh saying, "Oh,

secretly that it's probably not going to

like Adam or something?
like Adam or something?
Uh I tried that and no I still couldn't
Uh I tried that and no I still couldn't
get it to work with our aggressive

you can solve uh if you just take muon
and lower the learning rate it'll be
and lower the learning rate it'll be
stable for long enough to solve it but
stable for long enough to solve it but
it will eventually explode. Um and I've
it will eventually explode. Um and I've
seen that pretty consistently across
seen that pretty consistently across
everything.
everything.
Oh interesting exploding
Oh interesting exploding
bad. Uh oh that's because it it worked
bad. Uh oh that's because it it worked
really well before. No it didn't. I uh I
really well before. No it didn't. I uh I
checked your thing and it was just
checked your thing and it was just
because of your params. Like if you set
because of your params. Like if you set
more aggressive params, it doesn't.
No. Okay, that looks well. They're doing
No. Okay, that looks well. They're doing
something. Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah, that
something. Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah, that
looks about right. The puffer sim.
looks about right. The puffer sim.

It's like the magnitude off. Oh, okay.
It's like the magnitude off. Oh, okay.
So, well, I can kind of explain this or
So, well, I can kind of explain this or
anything like
anything like
the rewards. Is it normalized? Cuz like
the rewards. Is it normalized? Cuz like
this thing is like if I just take this
this thing is like if I just take this
protected count, this should be
protected count, this should be
divided by two. That's normal. I mean,
divided by two. That's normal. I mean,
there should be a lot of there should be
there should be a lot of there should be
a lot of puffers up in your grill,
a lot of puffers up in your grill,
right? Like why why is it so low?
right? Like why why is it so low?
What is this? What? This is all puffers
What is this? What? This is all puffers
within I maybe this is just too
within I maybe this is just too
low. 100.
low. 100.
So let's see how let's see how many we
So let's see how let's see how many we
if we have a 100 puffers.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
There's just no way. Like I've gotten

We lost all of our drones.
What? What? We lose all our drones. No,
What? What? We lose all our drones. No,
we we were saying like imagine if we ran
we we were saying like imagine if we ran
the voids on on drones. Oh, yeah. Well,
the voids on on drones. Oh, yeah. Well,
I mean I honestly I think we could
I mean I honestly I think we could
probably train some pretty ridiculously
probably train some pretty ridiculously
impressive stuff very
impressive stuff very
easily. Just if you like literally if

this should be easier than whatever
this should be easier than whatever
weird

thing we're trying to implement.
Okay, so there you
Okay, so there you
go. The reward a little tiny bit.
go. The reward a little tiny bit.
Yeah, we probably need to normalize it
Yeah, we probably need to normalize it
better probably. I don't know.
I'm just going to do
Am I missing something on this tutorial?

they weren't naming conventions. They

um the uh one of like matching uh

um try to basically have the uh average
um try to basically have the uh average

see everything. It just the reward only
see everything. It just the reward only
um applies in a certain range.
That one is for the velocity. Yeah, the

Depends on the thing. Yeah. What are you
Depends on the thing. Yeah. What are you
talking about specifically? In in
talking about specifically? In in
Python, step is almost always referred
Python, step is almost always referred
to as tick and time out is referred to

used for steps and, uh, time test is
used for steps and, uh, time test is
used instead of timeout, but they both
used instead of timeout, but they both
do the same thing. We should probably
do the same thing. We should probably
keep it the same, but I mean, that's
keep it the same, but I mean, that's
really pedantic. Honestly, I care so
really pedantic. Honestly, I care so
much more about stuff like not having a
much more about stuff like not having a

Okay.
Okay.
Like it's like if you're going to look

Okay. Well, I guess what should it do?
Okay. Well, I guess what should it do?
Theoretically, it should try just match

Yeah, it'll look cooler if you do not
Yeah, it'll look cooler if you do not

Well, that's the thing. We're going to
Well, that's the thing. We're going to
have it's a tunable factor, so you can,
have it's a tunable factor, so you can,

Oh, poor you. You only get to train at
Oh, poor you. You only get to train at

like Yeah. I'm not going to lie. Puffers
here. Have some puffers.
Yeah. They don't they don't collide with

the right call is to make them like be
the right call is to make them like be
able to go through each other. No, it's
able to go through each other. No, it's
the thing is like we got to tune do a

little
also. Um, so for the avoidance reward,
also. Um, so for the avoidance reward,
um, like my original, uh, avoidance
um, like my original, uh, avoidance
reward, I would like to try to explain

it to you and you may be telling me
it to you and you may be telling me
like, is this a good idea? Is this bad?
like, is this a good idea? Is this bad?
And like why it's bad, why it's good or
And like why it's bad, why it's good or
kind of thing or like, well, I'm mostly
kind of thing or like, well, I'm mostly
looking for why it's bad. Hang on. But
looking for why it's bad. Hang on. But
yeah, let me do
yeah, let me do

Okay, there we go.
This gets like
This gets like

Okay, that's not good.
So what's gamma
So what's gamma
discount factor? What's gamma
discount factor? What's gamma
discount factor? Gamma is very
discount factor? Gamma is very
important. What does it tune? Does it
important. What does it tune? Does it
Okay, I guess yeah, I need to I need to
Okay, I guess yeah, I need to I need to
um look more into RL and like read some
um look more into RL and like read some
papers, read some I have a blog for you.
papers, read some I have a blog for you.
Blog posts? Yeah, give me a blog post.
Blog posts? Yeah, give me a blog post.
Is it my blog post? What's Costas? Well,
Is it my blog post? What's Costas? Well,
that is that is one of the ones I
that is that is one of the ones I
recommend in my blog post. I'll give you
recommend in my blog post. I'll give you
that. Okay, start with justice.
that. Okay, start with justice.
I also have a massive list of various
I also have a massive list of various
resources. So, if you want any, just DM
resources. So, if you want any, just DM
me. I'll DM you then. But also, I guess
me. I'll DM you then. But also, I guess
um for prerequisites. Um, should I? Cuz
um for prerequisites. Um, should I? Cuz
right now I'm kind of in the middle of

This one's took me like 10 times
worth 10 minutes.
Mhm. Jesus

correctly. That one took like 10 N's
correctly. That one took like 10 N's
worth.
Wait, what are you doing to format it?
Wait, what are you doing to format it?
Uh, just normalizing variable names and

Yeah. Um, read read the target end. Read
Yeah. Um, read read the target end. Read
the target end real quick. Okay, sure.
the target end real quick. Okay, sure.
Because I wrote it yesterday, so it's
Because I wrote it yesterday, so it's
like the like cleanest
like the like cleanest
most up toate thing. Neural MMO is like
most up toate thing. Neural MMO is like
pretty decent, but it's also the first
pretty decent, but it's also the first
major piece of C that I had to write.
So that's 2.0. What am I
So that's 2.0. What am I
doing? Okay, there we go.
material squared and target cleaned
material squared and target cleaned

Now we just
make you a network.
What? Making you a network.

puffer lib ocean and it switches to 2.0
ask me.
Nice. Okay, perfect.
Now I just need the pencil.
Now I just need the pencil.
Yep. Nice.
Yep. Nice.
Okay.
Interesting. Outline
Interesting. Outline
pencil pen. Just
nice. Nice. I got a puffer white board.
nice. Nice. I got a puffer white board.
Sketchboard buffer themed
sketchboard. Yeah, it's basically the
sketchboard. Yeah, it's basically the
same thing. Uh, in fact, your PIS script
same thing. Uh, in fact, your PIS script
is essentially basically how I'm
is essentially basically how I'm
rewriting it with the um target SPS
rewriting it with the um target SPS
being like the only main thing
different. And you also changed Yeah,
different. And you also changed Yeah,
you you changed ticks to step as well.
you you changed ticks to step as well.
So that's that's funny.
What What did I change to steps? Um,
What What did I change to steps? Um,
yeah. So in I just do that in the perf
yeah. So in I just do that in the perf
test cuz I I the reason I do that is cuz
test cuz I I the reason I do that is cuz
like ticks is like when you're like in
like ticks is like when you're like in
the internals of the game, it's the
the internals of the game, it's the
number of game ticks or whatever. Yeah.
number of game ticks or whatever. Yeah.
So yeah, that's why I usually do that.
So yeah, that's why I usually do that.
Yeah, a lot of the older M's have ticks
Yeah, a lot of the older M's have ticks
instead. Yeah, tick is fine. Steps is
instead. Yeah, tick is fine. Steps is
fine. It doesn't matter that much.
fine. It doesn't matter that much.
Yeah, it depends because like the thing
Yeah, it depends because like the thing
is tick is like for a neural MMO
is tick is like for a neural MMO
specifically like the tick system is a
specifically like the tick system is a
common thing that you to talk about in
common thing that you to talk about in
like an MMO.
Yep. It's also confusing steps is more
Yep. It's also confusing steps is more
straightforward. That's fine.
I'm nitpicky.
I'm nitpicky.
Okay, here we go. Um, I can commit this
Okay, here we go. Um, I can commit this
now. Oh, cuz I keep Oh, that's why cuz I
now. Oh, cuz I keep Oh, that's why cuz I
have two tabs open. That's probably why
have two tabs open. That's probably why
it's defaulting to
it's defaulting to
2.0.

is just called blog.html.
Oh, it's uh it's it's in the docs.html

Yep. I guess he looked
at what the [ __ ]

Oh.
Oh.
Oh, hello.
Do you want the Perf test for the Python
Do you want the Perf test for the Python

you want it to be its own function?
you want it to be its own function?
Uh I put it in the main so that you can

run that the class directly. You can
run that the class directly. You can
just run the script.
Not that there are two.
I
see one of the first fundamental then
see one of the first fundamental then
skip right to

understand
understand
that. Mhm.
[Music]
I'm done.
Oh,
interesting. Appealing as an impressive

Ah, for some reason in target.py Pi you
Ah, for some reason in target.py Pi you
have I and steps and they both function

Steps get incremented by num agent so I

Ah and it's I% cache. Gotcha.
I love your description of multi- aent
I love your description of multi- aent
RL.
RL.
What? his his description of multi- aent
What? his his description of multi- aent
RL in his uh blog post is it's the same
RL in his uh blog post is it's the same
as as single agent RL except uh that the
as as single agent RL except uh that the
environments and tools are
jank. Oh, I see what's happened here in
jank. Oh, I see what's happened here in
the Okay.
Well,
well, this certainly is a good job of
well, this certainly is a good job of
slowing it the hell down.
slowing it the hell down.
Oh, uh, the new neural net. Yeah, there
Oh, uh, the new neural net. Yeah, there
we go. Okay. What what what are
we go. Okay. What what what are
architecture? Are you just doing a lot
architecture? Are you just doing a lot
of LSTMs or groups? Pointwise
of LSTMs or groups? Pointwise
architecture. So, it's it encodes all
architecture. So, it's it encodes all
the voids the same. So, it's
the voids the same. So, it's
positionally independent.
Um, I don't
Um, I don't
know if it doesn't Does it learn any
know if it doesn't Does it learn any
better? No idea. Probably not.
I think you got to like do some work on
I think you got to like do some work on
like the dynamics of this thing. Like it
like the dynamics of this thing. Like it
should be you should be able to get like
should be you should be able to get like
these nice swarm things out of it.
these nice swarm things out of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm going to give you I'm going to
I'm going to give you I'm going to
commit all this stuff up to you. You
commit all this stuff up to you. You
don't have to use this net. You can go
don't have to use this net. You can go
back to the default one. I'm gonna give
back to the default one. I'm gonna give
you all the stuff that I've done for
you all the stuff that I've done for
now. Yeah. Um, where are you going to
now. Yeah. Um, where are you going to
commit it?
Dev.
Dev.
Okay,
Okay,
sure. Okay, I simplified it out so I
sure. Okay, I simplified it out so I
isn't used anymore and used the old
isn't used anymore and used the old
version. I think that's it's it's more
version. I think that's it's it's more
easy to look at, at least in my opinion.
easy to look at, at least in my opinion.
It removes an extra variable that you
It removes an extra variable that you
don't need.
So, what would be I guess I was going to
So, what would be I guess I was going to
make a reference to a very old cartoon
make a reference to a very old cartoon
and then I realized that you weren't
and then I realized that you weren't
alive for that.
alive for that.
You'd be surprised. I might have not
You'd be surprised. I might have not
been alive, but I might have seen it. I
been alive, but I might have seen it. I
have no clue. My dad is a boomer, so I
have no clue. My dad is a boomer, so I
have seen a lot of old stuff.
have seen a lot of old stuff.
I'm a bunch of old
So, what should be kind of my next
So, what should be kind of my next
steps? Is it just adjusting rewards or
steps? Is it just adjusting rewards or
you're going to have to I You're going
you're going to have to I You're going
to have to adjust the rewards. You're
to have to adjust the rewards. You're
going to have to get [ __ ] normalized.
going to have to get [ __ ] normalized.
Um, right. Like RL's not going to
Um, right. Like RL's not going to
respond to like, well, if they're two
respond to like, well, if they're two
voids next to me, I get negative. two
voids next to me, I get negative. two
reward, but if there three voids next to
reward, but if there three voids next to
me, I get negative03 reward.
me, I get negative03 reward.
Like you it's like you got to give it a
Like you it's like you got to give it a
signal it can actually learn off of
signal it can actually learn off of
which is why it's like all right one boy
which is why it's like all right one boy
near you's negative quarter, two boys is
near you's negative quarter, two boys is
negative a half, you know, whatever. I
negative a half, you know, whatever. I
got to cap the rules. So very simple
got to cap the rules. So very simple
kind of just Yeah. very overthink it.
kind of just Yeah. very overthink it.
Mhm. And then like I I think that you
Mhm. And then like I I think that you
want to like look at the original the
want to like look at the original the
original rules right from that end and
original rules right from that end and
see if you can get
see if you can get
like it's probably like the alignment
like it's probably like the alignment
and the dispersion that are the most
and the dispersion that are the most
important right. Um yeah, the the
important right. Um yeah, the the
alignment and the um avoidance.
Well, is it is it just avoidance?
Well, is it is it just avoidance?
The [ __ ] There's a I don't know. I can
The [ __ ] There's a I don't know. I can
give you the Cornell the Cornell one.
give you the Cornell the Cornell one.
Well, you can look it up. Just voids.
Well, you can look it up. Just voids.
Cornell. Yeah, this thing. So, like
Cornell. Yeah, this thing. So, like
Well, separation.
Well, separation.
Oh, but it's coherence, right? So it's
Oh, but it's coherence, right? So it's
coherence coherence separation
coherence coherence separation
alignment. Yeah, you need these. I I
alignment. Yeah, you need these. I I
have um
have um
but yeah, I can I guess I mean I can
but yeah, I can I guess I mean I can
name them coherence separation. I don't
name them coherence separation. I don't
care the name. It's just you got to like
care the name. It's just you got to like
I there was a lot of normalization and
I there was a lot of normalization and
jank and weird things going on. So like
jank and weird things going on. So like
you got to get like you got to get these
you got to get like you got to get these
in a way that they can be very
in a way that they can be very
learnable. I think that like once you
learnable. I think that like once you
get a nice clean version of this, it
get a nice clean version of this, it
should be very easy to just instantly
should be very easy to just instantly
learn this type of behavior and it'll be
learn this type of behavior and it'll be
really cool to have. Okay. Yeah, it
really cool to have. Okay. Yeah, it
might be that like here, look at this.
might be that like here, look at this.
So, they have like this coherence.
So, they have like this coherence.
Mhm. There's this separation.
Mhm. There's this separation.
This is the avoidance. Yeah. Like look
This is the avoidance. Yeah. Like look
this. So, this is just like this is
this. So, this is just like this is
random whatever.
random whatever.
Then you'd
like now they all want to just go in the
like now they all want to just go in the
same direction. Yeah.
same direction. Yeah.
Now they want to stay away from each
Now they want to stay away from each
other as
other as
well. That's pretty freaking cool.
well. That's pretty freaking cool.
[Music]
[Music]
Mm. Right. There's like so much cool
stuff. I mean, you can see it's a little
stuff. I mean, you can see it's a little
fiddly to like hit the original
fiddly to like hit the original
behaviors. Like look
cool.
How's everyone doing? Good to
How's everyone doing? Good to

I did that through all of undergrad, but

random group chats I am in. And I highly
random group chats I am in. And I highly
suspect it's like CCP spy.
It's some It's some random engineer girl
It's some It's some random engineer girl
who has genetically beautiful in her
who has genetically beautiful in her
Twitter bio and like makes like vaguely

that's CCP spy. There's no way.
that's CCP spy. There's no way.
Oh god. I just realized what she meant.
Oh god. I just realized what she meant.
They go by CPC now.
They go by CPC now.
Is that so?
Is that so?
Yes. In order to be more friendly and
Yes. In order to be more friendly and
more uh what was the exact words they
more uh what was the exact words they
used? They were trying to appear I I
used? They were trying to appear I I
guess less communist. I don't know what
guess less communist. I don't know what
makes sense.
makes sense.
It's it's instead of the Well, the funny
It's it's instead of the Well, the funny
thing is China is not actually
thing is China is not actually
communist, but that's a whole long
communist, but that's a whole long
story. No, they're Marxist Leninist. I
story. No, they're Marxist Leninist. I
think it's more fascist and they tell
think it's more fascist and they tell
the people who support it. They tell
the people who support it. They tell
everyone it's communist so that they
everyone it's communist so that they
support them or whatever. That's
support them or whatever. That's
communism. Yeah. So CP CCP is the
communism. Yeah. So CP CCP is the
Chinese Communist Party whereas CPC is
Chinese Communist Party whereas CPC is
Communist Party of China. So it's
Communist Party of China. So it's
supposed to be more they've been that
supposed to be more they've been that
way since they've been CPC officially
way since they've been CPC officially
internally since like 2000 something.
internally since like 2000 something.
But uh as we can see this is not the
But uh as we can see this is not the
communist. We have the American flag.
communist. We have the American flag.
Yeah. America. America reminds me of
Yeah. America. America reminds me of
this guy that I was in a project with
this guy that I was in a project with
and I think he called like football
and I think he called like football
soccer and I was like, "No, it's not
soccer and I was like, "No, it's not
football. It's not soccer. It's
football. It's not soccer. It's
football." And then he says, "Bro, I I
football." And then he says, "Bro, I I
bleed red, white, and blue." I was like,
bleed red, white, and blue." I was like,
"What the [ __ ] does that mean?" And
"What the [ __ ] does that mean?" And
then, "Oh, the flag." I was like, "Oh,
then, "Oh, the flag." I was like, "Oh,
okay."
okay."
That's funny.
That's funny.
Welcome. Most people just bleed red.
Yeah, but us, you know, Americans have
Yeah, but us, you know, Americans have
that uh blue 240 or whatever, you know,
that uh blue 240 or whatever, you know,
so they bleed blue.
so they bleed blue.
What does blue mean? All the dyes. It's
What does blue mean? All the dyes. It's
like the food dyes. Dies. Yeah. Oh,
like the food dyes. Dies. Yeah. Oh,
right. We do. We have that in America.
right. We do. We have that in America.
All right. I gotta I gotta call it
All right. I gotta I gotta call it

tiny boxes. It's like, you know, you
really I don't feel bad about buying
really I don't feel bad about buying
dumbbells and stuff when I think about
dumbbells and stuff when I think about
how much the damn servers cost.
how much the damn servers cost.
Like, god damn, giving George all my
Like, god damn, giving George all my
money. No, luckily those ones weren't

even with tariffs. You know, the
even with tariffs. You know, the
non-tariffs is still 25 grand a box. Um,
non-tariffs is still 25 grand a box. Um,
all right. And I I think most of it is
all right. And I I think most of it is
because uh they are all on kind of one
because uh they are all on kind of one

it's very simple. See you, Joseph. We
it's very simple. See you, Joseph. We
got we got a lot of stuff. So, there's

We've got some progress on Boyds here.
We've got some progress on Boyds here.
Um, so I think that tomorrow, oh, I also
Um, so I think that tomorrow, oh, I also
shipped the initial dev container. It's
shipped the initial dev container. It's
on the Docker Hub at the moment. and I
on the Docker Hub at the moment. and I
got to slim it down and I got to make
got to slim it down and I got to make
some fixes to it. But I think that
some fixes to it. But I think that
probably tomorrow I'm going to start I'm
probably tomorrow I'm going to start I'm
going to spend like a couple hours
going to spend like a couple hours
finishing docks and then I'm going to
finishing docks and then I'm going to
try to just like hammer out as many
try to just like hammer out as many
experiments as I can. Uh cuz we need to
experiments as I can. Uh cuz we need to
get to like the final experiments, final
get to like the final experiments, final
ablations, put it all together. This
ablations, put it all together. This
thing has just got to ship. The longer
thing has just got to ship. The longer
this thing goes without shipping, the
this thing goes without shipping, the
crazier I'm going to go. So yeah, agree.

Hi. I have some experiments to set up
Hi. I have some experiments to set up
and then if Gabe is around, we're going
and then if Gabe is around, we're going
to review his code. Then the only other
to review his code. Then the only other
thing I want to check
first
is right here.
Okay, so this container did get a bit
Okay, so this container did get a bit
bigger. This is a 12 gig
bigger. This is a 12 gig
container. So I don't know where the
container. So I don't know where the
extra seven is coming
from. I'll figure that
from. I'll figure that
out. I'll focus on that.
All
right. And
Gabe got a shake.
Awful.
God. Got to actually get my protein in
God. Got to actually get my protein in

You go just go check if there's an

That's not a freaking excuse. All right.
I had three like it literally like

Welcome,
Jose. X, Twitch, and
YouTube. Do Pac-Man review.
We can't hear him, by the way. My bad.
We can't hear him, by the way. My bad.
Let me fix
that. How do I fix that?
Say something. What do you Oh, wait. No,
Say something. What do you Oh, wait. No,
it should work.
What should work? Sorry. the stream
audio good
now. All right, let's take a look at
now. All right, let's take a look at
these
PRs. The heck is
this?
this?
Okay. Submit like really weird tiny PRs.
So let's see this PR different ghost
So let's see this PR different ghost
behavior for each ghost based on

world. Yeah, I I put that in there cuz
world. Yeah, I I put that in there cuz
it's Yeah, it's like a lot of everything
it's Yeah, it's like a lot of everything

simulation. It
is starting like
cool. Ghost all move in a direction that
cool. Ghost all move in a direction that
leads them to closest to their target

this scatter. They go to their
this scatter. They go to their
corner. Panic. Use random
directions and scatter alternate on a

fixed time
interval. Good model with randomized

position. But we'll get you a good model
position. But we'll get you a good model
then as well. Sweet. I'm excited to see
then as well. Sweet. I'm excited to see
it.

That should be cool.
That should be cool.
Uh, right. There 28 file changes, but if

I recall, it's just a bunch of tidy

Yeah, a lot of it's pictures, I
think. Uh, let's do

You've got a correct looking

we'll solve
at the end. It's human playable. It

looks
like a model in here, but no

aren't agents. Those are hardcoded.

frankly, because like you kind of want

Okay.
Yeah, this is

a little bit funky now that I see it
a little bit funky now that I see it

think it's like I'm putting a spawn

position on the ghost. Why don't I just
set them to their spawn position? Yeah,
set them to their spawn position? Yeah,
they already have they would already

My initial guess just like like just
My initial guess just like like just
like random guess of like how many lines
like random guess of like how many lines
do I think Pac-Man would be? like 600
do I think Pac-Man would be? like 600
700 and I think that's probably about

how short I could make it. Um, just
how short I could make it. Um, just
fiddling with

makes sense. I could definitely see

places to make it more

is this at anything.
Oh,
So Blinky targets the player.

Yep. Pinky the most direct

Yes. Okay.
Yes. Okay.
And then this one
And then this one
has just a different lead.
has just a different lead.
That's the most confusing one.
That's the most confusing one.
Um, and it's like that in the original
Um, and it's like that in the original
game. Um, there's a lead, but then it
game. Um, there's a lead, but then it
incorporates Blinky's
incorporates Blinky's
position over that lead.
position over that lead.
Um, it's pretty weird, but that's that's
Um, it's pretty weird, but that's that's
how it
works. And then glide is
works. And then glide is
just it targets the player if it's far
just it targets the player if it's far
away, but then if you're close to the
away, but then if you're close to the
player, it goes back to its corner.
Okay,
that might be a little funky. Well, the
that might be a little funky. Well, the
thing that's funky about it is
thing that's funky about it is
like if you have a grid, you may as well
like if you have a grid, you may as well
use it.
Yeah, the the grid is not used as much
Yeah, the the grid is not used as much
as it could be. It
as it could be. It
definitely made much simpler.

Yeah.
Have you looked at like some of the the

Yeah, I would have definitely used the

had um like an entity array that contain
had um like an entity array that contain
uh the ghost and maybe even the

you'd cut at least like 150 lines off.

to do this before. It is not

fun. So,
fun. So,
um, the worst freaking thing I've I had
um, the worst freaking thing I've I had
to do for this actually goes up right

Yeah, it looks great. This is the same
Yeah, it looks great. This is the same
sort of a thing,
sort of a thing,
right, where like you have to like do
right, where like you have to like do
this horrendous tile
this horrendous tile
mapping and it ends up being like
um it's just like a table lookup, but
um it's just like a table lookup, but
populating that table's a pain because

it's like it's it's a full bite. It's

just how the math works out because you

have your center tile which is always

got more tile types. Wait, I've got like

an agent that is better at this game
an agent that is better at this game
than I am.
I think you might be right about making

a really nice system. We use the same
a really nice system. We use the same

really good system. So, you have a grid.
really good system. So, you have a grid.
Your agent's on a grid, but the agent
Your agent's on a grid, but the agent
also has a continuous position. You just
also has a continuous position. You just
move it on the grid when it crosses tile
move it on the grid when it crosses tile
bounds. It's really easy to render. It's
bounds. It's really easy to render. It's
ridiculously fast because you just have
ridiculously fast because you just have
to check tiles, right? Especially if

only one thing can occupy a

animation not get updated? Is it because
of that frame time thing? I wonder. I

Yes, you do get points for ghosts. I

would add like a powerup seat and then

ghost seat. Add a couple stats.
ghost seat. Add a couple stats.
That still seems like that might not
That still seems like that might not

track. Like that might be too high. I'm
not sure. Let's see how good the agent
not sure. Let's see how good the agent
is, though. But we're not going to be

able to tell until I fix that evil thing
able to tell until I fix that evil thing
on you. Uh we'll see if the dots go away

at

the dots. I would consider that a solve.
So if we do that out of the

I have but not with the random starting

This would be first thing we tried which

I think will be to great credit of the

Okay,
we kind of have like a ridiculously good
we kind of have like a ridiculously good
reinforcement learning algorithm now for

what it is. Nice. Um this it has soded
what it is. Nice. Um this it has soded
out of the box two different client

Nice. That's awesome.
There's anyone on YouTube here watching
There's anyone on YouTube here watching
is in industry wants their reinforcement
is in industry wants their reinforcement
learning to actually work. Let me
learning to actually work. Let me
know. We make it easy.
Huh? Oh, it's get it's going. That looks
Huh? Oh, it's get it's going. That looks
good. Okay, so the score is the score is
good. Okay, so the score is the score is
completely different then from what cuz
completely different then from what cuz
it's getting 200 something
it's getting 200 something
which is definitely not bad. Like that's
which is definitely not bad. Like that's
way better than random.
way better than random.
Oh, this is about as well as I was
Oh, this is about as well as I was
doing, I think.
doing, I think.
So the question is why is there a
So the question is why is there a
discrepancy between this score
discrepancy between this score
number what's being
logged? Oh it you can see it's eating
logged? Oh it you can see it's eating
ghosts. Does their animations change to
ghosts. Does their animations change to
eaten? Yep.
Uh it starting position is not being
Uh it starting position is not being
randomized.
randomized.
No, by default it's not. How do we do
No, by default it's not. How do we do
that? There is an option to do that. Um
that? There is an option to do that. Um
go in the trainer there. It should be
go in the trainer there. It should be
one of the things passed in from the
one of the things passed in from the
Python side.
Randomized starting. Yep. That's for the
Randomized starting. Yep. That's for the
player.
So, um
does that need to be energy. Yeah. I'm
does that need to be energy. Yeah. I'm
going to try it like this if you don't
mind. That looks still just about Well,
mind. That looks still just about Well,
no, the score is lower, but it's going
no, the score is lower, but it's going
up. Well, to be fair, you like there are
up. Well, to be fair, you like there are
way more really bad starting positions,
way more really bad starting positions,
I think, than like really good ones. If
I think, than like really good ones. If
you start near the ghost, you're just
you start near the ghost, you're just
screwed.
Ghosts definitely need to move a bit
Ghosts definitely need to move a bit
slower when uh after you've eaten the
slower when uh after you've eaten the
pills or I don't think the game is
pills or I don't think the game is
solvable otherwise.
solvable otherwise.
Yeah, it might not be solvable all the
Yeah, it might not be solvable all the
time at least.
But we can see what this
does. It's definitely harder than actual
does. It's definitely harder than actual
Pac-Man if they don't slow
down. It's actually kind of insane how
down. It's actually kind of insane how
well this is working.
well this is working.
Um, I don't know how long you've been
Um, I don't know how long you've been
around reinforcement learning. This is

Yeah, that that's rough. I I believe it
Yeah, that that's rough. I I believe it
though.
It's all this darn field.
Okay. So, is it randomizing it like once
Okay. So, is it randomizing it like once
per end or something?
per end or something?
Should be per episode. Different
Should be per episode. Different
different start. not getting randomized
different start. not getting randomized
per episode, it looks like.
per episode, it looks like.
Oh, no, it is. It's just the animation's
Oh, no, it is. It's just the animation's
not updating.
not updating.
Yep. I think it's I think it's
Yep. I think it's I think it's
If you go
If you go
to I've got a quick fix. Um, if you just
to I've got a quick fix. Um, if you just
render them at their current position
render them at their current position
and like cut out that
and like cut out that
lurp, I think it'll work.
You won't get the smooth animation, but
You won't get the smooth animation, but
you'll actually see where where it is.
you'll actually see where where it is.
At least just pause.
You could also set progress to one and
You could also set progress to one and
that might work
too. If this because I think progress is
too. If this because I think progress is
staying at
staying at
zero. That could be part of the problem.
Fix the lurp.
I like having the Pac-Man with the
I like having the Pac-Man with the
puffer. the Pac-Man.
invalid from vector 2 to I vector 2. Oh
invalid from vector 2 to I vector 2. Oh
man. Oh yeah, that's rough.
man. Oh yeah, that's rough.
I vector two. might be the the simplest
I vector two. might be the the simplest
thing is just set progress to one like
thing is just set progress to one like
see that float
progress. I think that'll also
progress. I think that'll also
effectively stop lurping if progress is
effectively stop lurping if progress is
one.
Back
puff. There he is. Oh no. Wait. Did he
puff. There he is. Oh no. Wait. Did he
just go through the wall? Uh, I don't
just go through the wall? Uh, I don't
think he's supposed to do
think he's supposed to do
that. Well, I think the lurp stuff is
that. Well, I think the lurp stuff is
still wrong.
Yeah,
it's like it's not
it's like it's not
lurping the one axis like it's one of
lurping the one axis like it's one of
the
the
coordinates. It looked like he was doing

like y axis but not x
like y axis but not x
axis. Oh,
axis. Oh,
did I miss one?
What is this slurp supposed to be?
It it just
It it just
like displays the
position in between the their last
position in between the their last
location and their current
location and their current
location based on the progress like the
location based on the progress like the
percentage of
percentage of

And I would just do it like pick a
And I would just do it like pick a
number of frames per
number of frames per
step. Just do it fixed. Let me see if I
step. Just do it fixed. Let me see if I
can get that working for you real quick.
Yeah, I think maybe if you set it to one
Yeah, I think maybe if you set it to one
there that would work. I think I can do
progress
frame.
Um, hang on. I've done this twice this
Um, hang on. I've done this twice this
week.
Maybe this.
Well, this kind of this kind of requires
Well, this kind of this kind of requires
you to do
Oh, I think I see the other issue
Oh, I think I see the other issue
though.

Um, because it's updating the previous
Um, because it's updating the previous
alert
position outside of the render function.

That's the problem.
Where? But you
could you might be able to do like if
could you might be able to do like if
frame equals zero call the update lurp
frame equals zero call the update lurp
position like I think that I think

that's
that's
happening in the top level
happening in the top level

If wait update
lurp this thing. Yeah, update
lurp this thing. Yeah, update
interpolation. I can I can definitely
interpolation. I can I can definitely
fix all this stuff. Um,
fix all this stuff. Um,
see I want to see the thing go.
see I want to see the thing go.
I I see that I see I've done it in a a
I I see that I see I've done it in a a
bad way. Now,
bad way. Now,
I would look at like the way that we do
I would look at like the way that we do
it in uh in MOA or in um neural MMO is
it in uh in MOA or in um neural MMO is
neural MMO has tile based like
animations. Can I just do this? Does
animations. Can I just do this? Does
this work? I think if you do that,
this work? I think if you do that,
you'll definitely see it. Like it might
you'll definitely see it. Like it might
not interpolate, but they'll be in the
not interpolate, but they'll be in the
right
right
places, which would I think that's good
places, which would I think that's good
enough.
Hey, buffer.
Hey, buffer.
Nice.
Nice.
Yeah, he's trying, but it's freaking
Yeah, he's trying, but it's freaking
hard when they don't slow down. Mhm.
I'd be surprised if the M's beatable.
I mean like actually what do you do
I mean like actually what do you do
right?
Like okay like like what do I do here
Like okay like like what do I do here
right?
Now they're coming for me.
Now they're coming for me.
Yeah, I think you're done.
Yep. I can't even [ __ ] eat any of

Like I can get a bunch of points here
Like I can get a bunch of points here
probably,

but solving it is tough. Yeah, I agree.
but solving it is tough. Yeah, I agree.
It's probably too
It's probably too
hard or impossible sometimes. Although I

think if it's impossible probably

depends on I got 170. That was my best.
depends on I got 170. That was my best.
Yeah,
Yeah,
but my best was about what the bot got.
but my best was about what the bot got.
I I don't have a proof that it's not
I I don't have a proof that it's not
impossible. It might literally be
impossible. Probably dependent on
impossible. Probably dependent on
starting position though, if that's the
starting position though, if that's the
case and ghost delays and all that.
Yes, it's very hard.
It's reliant. I think the the game is
It's reliant. I think the the game is
reliant on you being able to bait them
reliant on you being able to bait them
to the power
pills, isn't there? I like
here. Yeah, that's not it.

Maybe. Oh my god, that's so loud.

I don't know how you mute the tab. What
I don't know how you mute the tab. What
the
hell, bro? I do know that the like Atari
the Atari version of Pac-Man was kind of
the Atari version of Pac-Man was kind of
garbage.
garbage.
A lot of them are. Oh, technically we
A lot of them are. Oh, technically we
could we probably have that, right?
could we probably have that, right?
There probably is like a play mode that
There probably is like a play mode that
I have built in already that I just
I have built in already that I just
haven't bothered with like
But the arcade the arcade rules were
But the arcade the arcade rules were
better. And then for Atari, Miss Pac-Man
better. And then for Atari, Miss Pac-Man
was but like more like the arcade
rules. Ms there's just Pac-Man. Wait,
rules. Ms there's just Pac-Man. Wait,
can I just do
this VM? Oh, come on.
Ah, darn. It doesn't render through uh
Ah, darn. It doesn't render through uh
through the
through the
Docker. I do literally have uh the Atari
Docker. I do literally have uh the Atari
version here,

but Oh, and it crashed my terminal. Good
but Oh, and it crashed my terminal. Good
job.
Let me push these fixes for you. And
Let me push these fixes for you. And
then I got to go back to my lucrative
then I got to go back to my lucrative
career of being a fashion model, I
career of being a fashion model, I
guess.
All right, there you go. So, we have
All right, there you go. So, we have
Yeah, thanks. I mean, yeah, we got your
Yeah, thanks. I mean, yeah, we got your
M training. There used to be all sorts
M training. There used to be all sorts
of stuff I had to show people with like,
of stuff I had to show people with like,
you know, running sweeps and like tuning
you know, running sweeps and like tuning
this and tuning that and then we kind of
this and tuning that and then we kind of
just I kind of just like added a better
just I kind of just like added a better
algorithm and now it like the thing just
algorithm and now it like the thing just
works. Nice. It's awesome.
works. Nice. It's awesome.
That was fun. Very cool. So, I think you
That was fun. Very cool. So, I think you
I think you know um if you can make the
I think you know um if you can make the
ghost look, I don't want to make you
ghost look, I don't want to make you
spend tons and tons of time on this Z
spend tons and tons of time on this Z
because you sound like you're pretty
because you sound like you're pretty
busy. And there's also if you want to do
busy. And there's also if you want to do
RL stuff, there's also tons of other
RL stuff, there's also tons of other
stuff that you can do in here with
stuff that you can do in here with
different M's and like, you know, I want
different M's and like, you know, I want
to keep stuff interesting. So, if you
to keep stuff interesting. So, if you
want to do a bigger refactor, do a
want to do a bigger refactor, do a
bigger refactor. You want to do
bigger refactor. You want to do
different RL, do different RL. But for
different RL, do different RL. But for
this M, if you can at least just like
this M, if you can at least just like
get the interpolation that you already
get the interpolation that you already
have to work and um maybe like I don't
have to work and um maybe like I don't
know if you can make the ghost be slower
know if you can make the ghost be slower
or like
or like
something, but they've got to be nerfed
something, but they've got to be nerfed
somehow while they're
somehow while they're
um in power pill like when you get the
um in power pill like when you get the
power pill so that you can actually eat
power pill so that you can actually eat
them. Cuz otherwise I think that the
them. Cuz otherwise I think that the
whole point of
whole point of
Pac-Man is that you're supposed to be
Pac-Man is that you're supposed to be
able to like eat a bunch of stuff and
able to like eat a bunch of stuff and
then bait them to the power pill, right?
then bait them to the power pill, right?
Yeah. Yeah, totally. No. Isn't that
Yeah. Yeah, totally. No. Isn't that
That's how it works, right? Like if you
That's how it works, right? Like if you
like
like
No, you I want to get the actual game
No, you I want to get the actual game
because I haven't like played it.
Why are they all so
Why are they all so
loud? Okay, I can mute it.
Okay. Is it just Are the ghosts your
Okay. Is it just Are the ghosts your
same speed?
same speed?
They're a little faster,
They're a little faster,
but I think it depends on the level
but I think it depends on the level
you're on.
you're on.
Look at that. So, it pauses. I eat
Look at that. So, it pauses. I eat
freaking three of them,
right? And now they're so much slower.
Look at
that. And I'm dead. But I also You get
that. And I'm dead. But I also You get
five lives to complete this one level
five lives to complete this one level
usually. Mhm.
I'm sure you would get it if I had
I'm sure you would get it if I had
multiple lives, too. Doing it on one
multiple lives, too. Doing it on one
life with fast scared ghosts is is uh is
life with fast scared ghosts is is uh is
a lot
harder. Okay, so I just got the first
harder. Okay, so I just got the first
stage with two lives, right? after
stage with two lives, right? after
having tried it several times on the
having tried it several times on the
other
other
version and then it's like is it this
version and then it's like is it this
does the level ever get harder or is it
does the level ever get harder or is it
just you do the same damn thing
just you do the same damn thing
repeatedly?
repeatedly?
It does get harder. Um how
It does get harder. Um how
the they stay frightened for less
the they stay frightened for less
time and they spend more time chasing
time and they spend more time chasing
you and less time in their
corners. And then eventually the power

I mean, you could pretty easily just add
I mean, you could pretty easily just add
lives as well. It's like you literally

already have the reset function broken
already have the reset function broken
out for it. Mhm.

It's actually like mechanically kind of
It's actually like mechanically kind of
snappy.
Okay. So, yeah, it's
definitely What's
this, huh? Oh, it just gives you this
this, huh? Oh, it just gives you this
weird animation.
Why does it feel easier here? It's like,
Why does it feel easier here? It's like,
is the ghost
is the ghost
AI different? It feels like more of the

It is. The timing might be

right. Like how long they stay in there.
So, they're definitely like in the
So, they're definitely like in the

perfects me.

Great. All right,
Great. All right,
cool. All right. Well, congratulations
cool. All right. Well, congratulations
uh on your first NPR. If you can clean
uh on your first NPR. If you can clean
up a few things, I think that'll be a
up a few things, I think that'll be a
very nice uh addition. We like to have
very nice uh addition. We like to have
some of these these classic arcade
some of these these classic arcade
games. Let's see how it looks at the
games. Let's see how it looks at the
moment. I actually wasn't really even
moment. I actually wasn't really even
paying attention to how it looks. I was
paying attention to how it looks. I was
just kind of like trying to get it
solved. Do one very small
solved. Do one very small
thing. Well, can I do you mind if I uh I
thing. Well, can I do you mind if I uh I
tweak the base pallet just a tiny bit?
tweak the base pallet just a tiny bit?
Leave the ghost. Yeah, go for it.
Leave the ghost. Yeah, go for it.
Totally. You can you can tweak anything.
Totally. You can you can tweak anything.
It's your project. Well, I like to be
It's your project. Well, I like to be
somewhat respectful, you know, to the
somewhat respectful, you know, to the
contributors. But what we do like to do
contributors. But what we do like to do
is
We have a pallet kind and I draw things
We have a pallet kind and I draw things
from this. Gotcha.
from this. Gotcha.
Like
here. Let's just put this somewhere.

There should be a pellet color that you

I don't know, man. It's I mean, we could
add some smoke to this. That That could
add some smoke to this. That That could
be kind of cool.
be kind of cool.
I have brush
I have brush
hardness. What is that G there? Yeah,
hardness. What is that G there? Yeah,
now we have text on the tile map.
now we have text on the tile map.
What?
What?
Damn it.
Damn it.
Photoshop. Somebody's going to just have
Photoshop. Somebody's going to just have
to do this, I think. And
to do this, I think. And
Can I just
Can I just
like there even a bucket
like there even a bucket
tool? Where the [ __ ] is the bucket tool?
tool? Where the [ __ ] is the bucket tool?
I think they removed that one, too. Oh,
I think they removed that one, too. Oh,
no. Here it is. So, like
no. Here it is. So, like
So, it's What is it? Um
Why does it cancel my
selection?
selection?
Okay. So, they kept the shortcuts the
Okay. So, they kept the shortcuts the
same at least.
same at least.
But like I can just
But like I can just
do
this. I wouldn't even worry about the
this. I wouldn't even worry about the
stuff in between. You can go over that.
stuff in between. You can go over that.
Like that's just a visual
guide. I don't know why the [ __ ] I'm
guide. I don't know why the [ __ ] I'm
doing this in the first place.
Like for
up that's not used. No, actually it
up that's not used. No, actually it
might be. I
forget. I think that is that part is
forget. I think that is that part is
used.
Yeah. Just clicks.
You might be able to use the bucket tool
You might be able to use the bucket tool
even if it's not
selected. Doubt
it. Like give me like ghost
it. Like give me like ghost
fill is
[ __ ] Surely the most efficient way
[ __ ] Surely the most efficient way
is to select pixels one at a time in the
is to select pixels one at a time in the
[ __ ] web version of Photoshop.
It's actually editing the binary
It's actually editing the binary
manually. That's that's the most
manually. That's that's the most
efficient. You know, it wouldn't be that
efficient. You know, it wouldn't be that
much slower at this point.
And now this is the hard
one. Yeah.
one. Yeah.
No,
No,
this
this
think. Oh, man. I'm going to have to
think. Oh, man. I'm going to have to
copy the last one, I
think. How do we copy?
coffee.
Oh,
okay. Nice. That looks good.
Almost. Can I get it?
Almost. Can I get it?
Nice.
Nice.
Nice. Now that background
Nice. Now that background
um transparent.
um transparent.
Uh what about the one at the bottom
Uh what about the one at the bottom
left? Is that transparent too or am I
left? Is that transparent too or am I
Yeah, I think
Yeah, I think
so. Yeah, I mean looks like
Let's see if this actually does anything
Let's see if this actually does anything
after all that.
Oh, that's looks like Puffer Pac-Man to
Oh, that's looks like Puffer Pac-Man to
me. Nice.
me. Nice.
I'm actually proud of that. That looks
I'm actually proud of that. That looks
like it. Yeah, I'm actually proud of
like it. Yeah, I'm actually proud of
that. That's good.
Very
Very
cool. Just need to get the
cool. Just need to get the
intribulations working the right way.
intribulations working the right way.
Right. Yeah. I can't get you interps.
Right. Yeah. I can't get you interps.
But I did
But I did
uh I think that's pretty solid.
uh I think that's pretty solid.
Mhm. Yeah, I'm happy with that.
There you
There you
are. So I contributed
are. So I contributed
uh we also add the uh other colors the
uh we also add the uh other colors the
background color.
We like to try to keep everything just
We like to try to keep everything just
slightly puffer themed.
slightly puffer themed.
Nice. And uh yeah, that'll be cool. So,
Nice. And uh yeah, that'll be cool. So,
I think if you fix the interpolation and
I think if you fix the interpolation and
you do it without timing, if you do it
you do it without timing, if you do it
like based on frame or whatever, it will
like based on frame or whatever, it will
also be able to just be way easier to
also be able to just be way easier to
toss on the website. Sweet. Cuz I what I
toss on the website. Sweet. Cuz I what I
would like to do, my goal is I would
would like to do, my goal is I would
like to have everybody as new MS. I
like to have everybody as new MS. I
don't know what the heck happened here.
don't know what the heck happened here.
Oh, no. This is fine. It's just that
Oh, no. This is fine. It's just that
there are only a few tiles left. Um, I
there are only a few tiles left. Um, I
want to have everybody's M on here. I
want to have everybody's M on here. I
think by current count, we should have
think by current count, we should have
22 environments for the release. Nice.
Nice be. Uh, it should be good. Hey, we
Nice be. Uh, it should be good. Hey, we
have nine people online. Welcome
have nine people online. Welcome
everyone. This is uh open source ultra
everyone. This is uh open source ultra
hyper reinforcement learning stuff.
hyper reinforcement learning stuff.
um build some environments with
us. What time is it? Nine.
us. What time is it? Nine.
I still have to launch a couple
I still have to launch a couple
quicks.
quicks.
Uh this this other new one I think is
Uh this this other new one I think is
also going to be really nice. This
also going to be really nice. This
um
um
target I want to do way more with stuff
target I want to do way more with stuff
that looks like this. Oh yeah, also the
that looks like this. Oh yeah, also the
the C doesn't work perfectly. This is
the C doesn't work perfectly. This is
supposed to be the policy loaded into C.
supposed to be the policy loaded into C.
and it like kind of works, but I think
and it like kind of works, but I think
that there's like some there's some
that there's like some there's some
small
small
errors because the the PyTorch version
errors because the the PyTorch version
is way better.
Are there any numerical precision
Are there any numerical precision
differences between torch and C? There's
differences between torch and C? There's
probably I screwed or that or I screwed
probably I screwed or that or I screwed
something else up, right?
Um, yeah, I screwed I just screwed
Um, yeah, I screwed I just screwed
something up for sure.
All right, I think I'm going to hop off,
All right, I think I'm going to hop off,
but thank you very much for the you get
but thank you very much for the you get
those things in. That'll be uh that'll
those things in. That'll be uh that'll
be great. And I will be very happy to
be great. And I will be very happy to
have Pac-Man in Puffer. Sweet. Thank
have Pac-Man in Puffer. Sweet. Thank
you. All right, have a good one. Yeah.
you. All right, have a good one. Yeah.
See you.
See you.
Let me get this. Let me make sure I can
Let me get this. Let me make sure I can
actually run this thing plasma and then
actually run this thing plasma and then
uh we will take a look at
your Ah, I see what happened.
I'm going to keep watching this on the

Let me let me Y
you're on.
you're on.
I hope so. Basically, um I have these

tun tunable parameters. And right now,
tun tunable parameters. And right now,
um basically I only turned on the one
um basically I only turned on the one

policies I train basically like every
policies I train basically like every
one of them love the quarter and I also
one of them love the quarter and I also
like switch to recurrent because it
like switch to recurrent because it
works now.
works now.
Okay. Um I mean if you if you PR like an

initial version I can just like fiddle
initial version I can just like fiddle
with it. I can see um here I think I
with it. I can see um here I think I
pushed Yeah. Everything Wait, let me
Is it Syon or binding?
Is it Syon or binding?
Uh, normal. The C binding, the new one.
Uh, normal. The C binding, the new one.
That's nice. That's less work for me.
That's nice. That's less work for me.
Mhm. I've done enough work. Lord

my Let me make sure. I think should be
my Let me make sure. I think should be
up on my draft.
Good. Yeah, it should be Yeah, it should

be good now. You know, if you look at my
be good now. You know, if you look at my
uh like in progress. Yeah, take your

Oh yeah, you have
this one.
this one.
Uh, voids in in progress. That one.
Uh, voids in in progress. That one.
Yeah,
Yeah,
voids.
First of all, let's actually look at
First of all, let's actually look at
your
your
code. New PRS
2 is 4096, right? Yeah, that's correct.
I can't get the ramp to work. And that's
I can't get the ramp to work. And that's
not
ultimate. Is everything good? And
But
yeah. Oh, I know how we're going to fix
yeah. Oh, I know how we're going to fix
this for
this for
sure. Okay.
Yeah, for
Yeah, for
sure. Okay. Oh, should I copy that? No,
sure. Okay. Oh, should I copy that? No,
you're fine. Let me
just have 30. Okay. 300 line files.
just have 30. Okay. 300 line files.
Really, really pretty.
Yeah, a lot of it is just constants,
Yeah, a lot of it is just constants,
strcts. Yeah, you should take a look at
strcts. Yeah, you should take a look at
the new target code as well as a
the new target code as well as a
reference. I made it really clean.
Yeah, I still have some like stuff I
Yeah, I still have some like stuff I
probably should just like remove or
probably should just like remove or
something like that. But you're like the
something like that. But you're like the
thing is it's going to always be worse
thing is it's going to always be worse
when you're like deving and confused on
when you're like deving and confused on
how to get the thing to train. Like let
how to get the thing to train. Like let
me help you with that and then you can
me help you with that and then you can
clean it up. I would like to have I
clean it up. I would like to have I
would like to have this one clean
would like to have this one clean
because I actually want to do more
because I actually want to do more
particle based stuff and this like Mhm.
particle based stuff and this like Mhm.
really nice reference.
really nice reference.
Yeah, particle base will be really cool.
Yeah, particle base will be really cool.
It'll be really cool to do a lot with
It'll be really cool to do a lot with
that. what you did with the target but
that. what you did with the target but
for continuous which I'm guessing that
for continuous which I'm guessing that
one looked it is it looked uh the
one looked it is it looked uh the
actions aren't continuous but the only
actions aren't continuous but the only
reason the action the actions are
reason the action the actions are
discretized
discretized
um but the the state is continuous
um but the the state is continuous
by state what do you mean the position
by state what do you mean the position
the positions
the positions
yeah I see well I guess the actions cuz
yeah I see well I guess the actions cuz
it looked like the actions were very you
it looked like the actions were very you
know They weren't very smooth. The only
know They weren't very smooth. The only
reason that they're discretized is
reason that they're discretized is
because uh we have continuous actions.
because uh we have continuous actions.
They seem way way worse to train.
They seem way way worse to train.
Yeah, I have continuous actions.
Yeah, I have continuous actions.
Oh, we're going to Yeah, that's
why. Why don't I just merge this, fix
why. Why don't I just merge this, fix
it, and then I'll give you a full code
it, and then I'll give you a full code
review when you're ready to actually
review when you're ready to actually
submit the code. Okay.
submit the code. Okay.
Um, is that okay? What What do you mean?
Um, is that okay? What What do you mean?
Like Oh, like you want to like So I Why
Like Oh, like you want to like So I Why
don't I help you? Why don't Why don't I
don't I help you? Why don't Why don't I
spend the time getting this to train
spend the time getting this to train
with you tonight? So I'll merge it and
with you tonight? So I'll merge it and
then when you're ready to like have the
then when you're ready to like have the
final version, I'll do a full code
final version, I'll do a full code
review for you. Oh, okay. So like So
review for you. Oh, okay. So like So
everyone review I do a full code review
everyone review I do a full code review
for everyone when they submit an end.
for everyone when they submit an end.
But what I'm saying is that I'll still
But what I'm saying is that I'll still
do that, but why don't I just help you
do that, but why don't I just help you
get it to work for now? Yeah. Yeah, that
get it to work for now? Yeah. Yeah, that
sounds
good. [ __ ]

Um, watch this. Kale.
Kale. You mean a proc KL? It blew up for
Kale. You mean a proc KL? It blew up for

a second and then then it actually
didn't. But you're on a zero score then.
didn't. But you're on a zero score then.
Well, yeah. Yeah. Um,
Well, yeah. Yeah. Um,
so only only what's gets logged right
so only only what's gets logged right
now for the user is N and score because
now for the user is N and score because
I have no idea what the others actually
I have no idea what the others actually
mean like what should what I should do
mean like what should what I should do
with them. So I just am zeroing them
with them. So I just am zeroing them
now. Okay. So can I let me mess with
now. Okay. So can I let me mess with
some stuff here. So action space size
some stuff here. So action space size
it's two. And then what is the what are
it's two. And then what is the what are
the actions supposed to be between
the actions supposed to be between
between zero and one or something?
between zero and one or something?
Um it's between like negative one and
Um it's between like negative one and
one or something. Okay. And then what
one or something. Okay. And then what
does it represent? Is it like vx v y or
does it represent? Is it like vx v y or
something? Yeah, exactly. Okay. Easy. So
something? Yeah, exactly. Okay. Easy. So
then all we have to do for that
is you man.
Latin action. Says
So, what did you do next? Did you make
So, what did you do next? Did you make
the actions? I just discretized I just
the actions? I just discretized I just
discretized the actions.
discretized the actions.
Um, but you're not getting any. I still
Um, but you're not getting any. I still
wasn't able to train. Uh
wasn't able to train. Uh
well score basically score right now the
well score basically score right now the
user log score is average reward of all
user log score is average reward of all
the voids.
and not that, right? Yeah, that's the
and not that, right? Yeah, that's the
exact opposite of what it should do.
exact opposite of what it should do.
Yeah, because um right now if you kept
Yeah, because um right now if you kept
the config the same, I basically only
the config the same, I basically only
turned on the corners. So basically the
turned on the corners. So basically the
way this agent gets negative reward is
way this agent gets negative reward is
by going to to like to the corners.
Oh, what is the observations?
Oh, what is the observations?
Uh, the observations are the x y vx vy.
Uh, the observations are the x y vx vy.
Oh, that'sed.
Oh, really? Yes, absolutely.
Oh, really? Yes, absolutely.
Okay, good point. And what is it? Is it
Okay, good point. And what is it? Is it
like size? Is the map size there? Like
like size? Is the map size there? Like
map size? Yes, there is a width and
map size? Yes, there is a width and
height.
It's in the client. Is it in the end?
It's in the client. Is it in the end?
I don't think so. No. How do you how do
I don't think so. No. How do you how do
you do do bounce detection in the end?
you do do bounce detection in the end?
In the
In the
end. Um in the step I
end. Um in the step I
have. Yeah. Well, that's the thing. The
have. Yeah. Well, that's the thing. The
right here, right? This is a capital
right here, right? This is a capital
width. Yep. It's the It's the constants.
width. Yep. It's the It's the constants.
Fine. All right. So, we'll do Yeah, I
Fine. All right. So, we'll do Yeah, I
should I can It's probably better. I
should I can It's probably better. I
should probably have width and height.
should probably have width and height.
Velocity. Uh, yes. Uh, I think it's
Velocity. Uh, yes. Uh, I think it's
called a velocity cap. Exactly.
called a velocity cap. Exactly.
Right now, it's three, but again,
Right now, it's three, but again,
we can do that.
We're going to see if I can magically
We're going to see if I can magically
solve all your problems today. Mhm.
solve all your problems today. Mhm.
I'm usually quite decent at that.
I'm usually quite decent at that.
So what's um why I guess what's the
So what's um why I guess what's the
logic behind
logic behind
um I guess um normalizing observations
um I guess um normalizing observations
neural nets don't like
is it that's seriously it neural nets
is it that's seriously it neural nets
don't like big numbers right so you
don't like big numbers right so you
normalize it just because it goes into
normalize it just because it goes into
the neural net as an input and I guess
the neural net as an input and I guess
if it was just, you know, for the like
if it was just, you know, for the like
uh just for the env logic or the uh it
uh just for the env logic or the uh it
doesn't matter exactly. Okay. Yeah,
that looks different, doesn't it? That
that looks different, doesn't it? That
looks really good. That's very different
looks really good. That's very different
from what you've had, huh? 100%. Okay,
from what you've had, huh? 100%. Okay,
so you only two fixes.
so you only two fixes.
So you normalized observations, right?
So you normalized observations, right?
And I discret and I discretized your
And I discret and I discretized your
actions though. We can try it with uh
actions though. We can try it with uh
continuous but from my initial like my
continuous but from my initial like my
tests on other environments continuous
tests on other environments continuous
has looked not so good.
has looked not so good.
Can we just try it and see how it looks?
Can we just try it and see how it looks?
We
We
can. But yeah, that looks good. That
can. But yeah, that looks good. That
looks really good.
looks really good.
Well, and I guess what do you think then
Well, and I guess what do you think then
of I guess so is there a plan to make
of I guess so is there a plan to make
continuous actions good? Well, I the
continuous actions good? Well, I the
thing is I don't necessarily know it's a
thing is I don't necessarily know it's a
bug and puffer. It could just be that
bug and puffer. It could just be that
it's [ __ ] hard to learn.
it's [ __ ] hard to learn.
H Are there any research papers do
H Are there any research papers do
talking about discrete versus continuous
talking about discrete versus continuous
actions? Well, we kind of know that
actions? Well, we kind of know that
continuous is a total mess and uh this
continuous is a total mess and uh this
is a good chance that this is why. And I
is a good chance that this is why. And I
also know that there are researchers who
also know that there are researchers who
prefer not using continuous. That said,
prefer not using continuous. That said,
this looks like it's learned just fine
this looks like it's learned just fine
in this case. Well, yeah. Let's see.
in this case. Well, yeah. Let's see.
Let's see. This has learned uh just fine
Let's see. This has learned uh just fine
with I believe this continuous. The
with I believe this continuous. The
score looks good. This is totally fine.
score looks good. This is totally fine.
So,
So,
um let's let's see the eval of it
maybe. I mean, it's really on like
maybe. I mean, it's really on like
longer runs what happens. It's just very
longer runs what happens. It's just very
unstable what I've seen.
Okay. Let's see. Okay. Yeah, they're
Okay. Let's see. Okay. Yeah, they're
Yes. Okay.
Yes. Okay.
So, it is working. They're vibing. Yeah.
So, it is working. They're vibing. Yeah.
Nice. It was literally just your data,
Nice. It was literally just your data,
norm. I should add that. Yeah. It was
norm. I should add that. Yeah. It was
just my observations. Yeah. Let me just
just my observations. Yeah. Let me just
do that real quick.
do that real quick.
Yeah. Okay. That that that makes sense.
Yeah. Okay. That that that makes sense.
That totally makes sense. I for I
That totally makes sense. I for I
totally forgot about observation
normalization. Oh, do you have it
there? Oh, no. Oh, this is the new guide
there? Oh, no. Oh, this is the new guide
I'm writing. Oh, I thought I thought you
I'm writing. Oh, I thought I thought you
had it in there and you were going to be
had it in there and you were going to be
like, just read the docs, please. You
like, just read the docs, please. You
know, read the damn manual.
know, read the damn manual.
Oh, actually I did add it to the recent
one. Oh, I do have it here. I actually
one. Oh, I do have it here. I actually
already had it in the the new the new
already had it in the the new the new
guide. Oh,
guide. Oh,
but this isn't pushed yet. Normalize. I
but this isn't pushed yet. Normalize. I
did actually write that as part of the
did actually write that as part of the
checklist. Mhm. There you go. I'm
checklist. Mhm. There you go. I'm
predicting I'm predicting your errors.
predicting I'm predicting your errors.
Yeah. Um I guess now let's turn on all
Yeah. Um I guess now let's turn on all
the Yeah. How do I do it? Is it just in
the Yeah. How do I do it? Is it just in
the config? It's in in it's just in the
the config? It's in in it's just in the
in
file. Yeah. I I made it so that we can
file. Yeah. I I made it so that we can
sweep them later. So these factors can
sweep them later. So these factors can
put them to whatever you want. Yeah.
Well, they don't like that.
Well, they don't like that.
What? Oh, we'll see. We'll see. It's a
What? Oh, we'll see. We'll see. It's a
lot more. Ah, actually, yeah, your your

normalization is off now. So, yes, it's
normalization is off now. So, yes, it's
not going to work. Is the reward off?
not going to work. Is the reward off?
Uh, yeah, now it is cuz um it's not
Uh, yeah, now it is cuz um it's not
dynamically normalized. It just, you
dynamically normalized. It just, you
know, I just divided by two in uh that
know, I just divided by two in uh that
case. So, you can four. That's fine. Oh,
case. So, you can four. That's fine. Oh,
but look to nan.
That's bad.
Yeah, probably exploded cuz the
um the other rewards
um the other rewards
are more than four. They're like, yeah,
are more than four. They're like, yeah,
you probably we clip.
you probably we clip.
You shouldn't be able to break our uh
You shouldn't be able to break our uh
our train that easily.
Okay. Well, we we'll try a few different
Okay. Well, we we'll try a few different
things. I'll show
things. I'll show
you to just do some experiment food
you to just do some experiment food
today.
today.
Mhm. All right. So, this is no good.
Mhm. All right. So, this is no good.
Yeah. Says them's not the puffers.
Yeah. Says them's not the puffers.
Yeah. They're not puffering. Them not
Yeah. They're not puffering. Them not
the puffers, you know. Uh, so this avoid
the puffers, you know. Uh, so this avoid
one's probably pretty easy.
Yeah, that just means they should be
Yeah, that just means they should be
just running away from each other
just running away from each other
scared like they seen a demon
scared like they seen a demon
is max zero.
is max zero.
Yes, that's that. Yeah, with this one.
Yes, that's that. Yeah, with this one.
Yes. The only uh one I add to is the
Yes. The only uh one I add to is the
um
um
the margins reward. I'm thinking like I
the margins reward. I'm thinking like I
was going through this and thinking of
was going through this and thinking of
how I can add it so that I just don't I
how I can add it so that I just don't I
don't just p penalize I also
don't just p penalize I also
incentivize.
Whoa. Okay. They don't seem to be
Whoa. Okay. They don't seem to be
avoiding each other. So that reward
avoiding each other. So that reward
doesn't seem to be I wouldn't expect
doesn't seem to be I wouldn't expect
that to be zero.
They're puffering.
They're puffering.
Well, kind of. Yeah. Um
So that one is kind of very simple. I
So that one is kind of very simple. I
just
um I just basically calculate
um I just basically calculate
how if they're in the protected zone,
how if they're in the protected zone,
how how far away they are from the um
how how far away they are from the um
void, like how close they are to the
void, like how close they are to the
edge of the protected zone. and I kind
edge of the protected zone. and I kind
of um Oh, that's not avoiding. Okay, so
of um Oh, that's not avoiding. Okay, so
that's
that's
just what's
um Okay, we have to actually figure out
um Okay, we have to actually figure out
what are what are some intuitive ones
what are what are some intuitive ones
that we like know what it should do. Um
that we like know what it should do. Um
I mean, yeah, pro um protected one is
I mean, yeah, pro um protected one is
pretty intuitive in the sense of like um
pretty intuitive in the sense of like um
this is avoiding the edge, I guess,
this is avoiding the edge, I guess,
right? No. Uh so so the margin is the
right? No. Uh so so the margin is the
one that avoids the edge. The avoid
one that avoids the edge. The avoid
factor avoids each other. They like try
factor avoids each other. They like try
to avoid each. Okay. They're not doing
to avoid each. Okay. They're not doing
that, right? Yes. That's the issue. Um
that, right? Yes. That's the issue. Um
so h so right now I'm only penalizing
so h so right now I'm only penalizing
them based on if they are in the
them based on if they are in the
protected zone or not. What's the
protected zone or not. What's the
protected zone?
protected zone?
Uh it's you see how you have the
Uh it's you see how you have the
um so the reward is calculated in the
um so the reward is calculated in the
number is less than protected range.
number is less than protected range.
It's just the number of voids that are
It's just the number of voids that are
two plus. Okay. So here this is what
two plus. Okay. So here this is what
we'll do.
we'll do.
It's yeah but it I'm also calculating
It's yeah but it I'm also calculating
I'm calculating how close they are to
I'm calculating how close they are to
the edge and the closer they are the
the edge and the closer they are the
less penalized. They can't see each
less penalized. They can't see each
other right? Or can they can they see
other right? Or can they can they see
each other? They can't see each other.
Well, what do you Well, they do. I mean,
Well, what do you Well, they do. I mean,
they kind of the the policy sees all of
they kind of the the policy sees all of
them and No, it doesn't.
them and No, it doesn't.
They the policy sees the observations of
They the policy sees the observations of
Oh, you're
Oh, you're
saying Are you saying that? Okay. Maybe
saying Are you saying that? Okay. Maybe
literally they can't see each other.
literally they can't see each other.
So is the observations array just means
So is the observations array just means
that the um it's not just one policy.
that the um it's not just one policy.
It's not just like one input to one
It's not just like one input to one
policy. It's each one of those
policy. It's each one of those
xyvx y.
xyvx y.
So this here so this voids index this
So this here so this voids index this
data here is what the first void will
data here is what the first void will
see.
see.
And then on index one that's what the
And then on index one that's what the
second void will see.
second void will see.
I see. Okay, that's not what I had in
I see. Okay, that's not what I had in
mind. What I had in mind is to basically
mind. What I had in mind is to basically
have one network seeing everything and
have one network seeing everything and
managing everything. Well, you can do
managing everything. Well, you can do
that.
that.
Would that just mean I just basically
Would that just mean I just basically
flatten the array? Well, what you would
flatten the array? Well, what you would
do here? No, you'd need to do you need
do here? No, you'd need to do you need
to do another loop. Um,
we can do it real quick. Okay. So,
Okay. Okay.
Oh, you're just going to
Okay. Ward is affected by their puffers.
Okay. Ward is affected by their puffers.
Observations need to be and are not
Observations need to be and are not
yet. This is what we're do.
Well, they just I don't think see each
Well, they just I don't think see each
other
other
like they second they don't observe each
like they second they don't observe each
other but now hopefully they
do. The reward though is affected by the
do. The reward though is affected by the
other puffers because the reward is
other puffers because the reward is
basically calculating for each puffer.
basically calculating for each puffer.
It's looking at all the other puffers
It's looking at all the other puffers
and calculating the
reward. This might be hard for her to
reward. This might be hard for her to
learn. We will see.
There's the first pass. Now we have to
There's the first pass. Now we have to
actually
um do like
um do like
obsess. I can Oh yeah, you need to muck
obsess. I can Oh yeah, you need to muck
it correctly. I guess I can do.
Okay, we do this.
Okay, we do this.
Yeah. And then you do the same thing
Yeah. And then you do the same thing
when you well I guess we don't need to
when you well I guess we don't need to
we don't need to allocate them because
we don't need to allocate them because
we're passing them from the Python. So
we're passing them from the Python. So
we're fix to see after. I just want I
we're fix to see after. I just want I
just want to I want to get you something
just want to I want to get you something
that actually works. Mhm.
the other thing is the the score doesn't
the other thing is the the score doesn't
seem to be computed well.
Um the score is basically the average
reward. So that's yeah you have the
reward. So that's yeah you have the
current reward for each step for each
current reward for each step for each
like
like
um iteration and then the
Okay. In pixels, isn't it? Uh, yes.
Okay. In pixels, isn't it? Uh, yes.
Yeah. Two is nothing.
Well, I guess.
There we go.
Okay. Yeah. Here we go. I don't know if
Okay. Yeah. Here we go. I don't know if
it's rain. Mhm. We'll see. And we can
it's rain. Mhm. We'll see. And we can
probably, you
probably, you
know, we can um That's going to be hard.
Maybe we can increase the screen range
Maybe we can increase the screen range
and then have them like the screen size.
and then have them like the screen size.
Oh, there's so much stuff we so much
Oh, there's so much stuff we so much
stuff we can do here, man. you
know. Oh, and those margin turn factor,
know. Oh, and those margin turn factor,
centering factor, all those stuff you
centering factor, all those stuff you
can delete because we're uh getting them
can delete because we're uh getting them
from the config. So all those uh define
from the config. So all those uh define
factors, pound define factors, you can
factors, pound define factors, you can
totally remove
totally remove
the factors. Oh, okay. So that the
the factors. Oh, okay. So that the
define margin turn factor that one you
define margin turn factor that one you
you can remove all those because they're
you can remove all those because they're
gotten from the you know from the avoids
gotten from the you know from the avoids
in
any n
Yeah, those lines can be formatted
better. Okay,
is everything is just moving too slow.
is everything is just moving too slow.
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
It's really hard to learn if it takes a
It's really hard to learn if it takes a
million frames to do anything. Ah, so
million frames to do anything. Ah, so
you're saying
you're saying
Yes. So, there you go. See, immediately
Yes. So, there you go. See, immediately
I just made it learn better by just
I just made it learn better by just
making everything go faster.
making everything go faster.
And you mean by like the voids having
And you mean by like the voids having
the control to go faster.
the control to go faster.
So, let's see what this looks like. Then
So, let's see what this looks like. Then
you can probably remove the cap. Like
you can probably remove the cap. Like
you can increase the caps. I did. Oh,
you can increase the caps. I did. Oh,
you
you
did? Oh,
okay. Let's
see. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Cool. Right.
see. Whoa. Whoa. Okay. Cool. Right.
Yeah. They're they're trying to avoid
Yeah. They're they're trying to avoid
each other. I can kind of see
that. Yeah. Damn. They're going fast
that. Yeah. Damn. They're going fast
though. That's kind of It's cool, right?
though. That's kind of It's cool, right?
Um Yeah. It just It's very chaotic.
Yeah, it's cool. Um
Yeah, it's cool. Um
you pass these heights in. You don't,
you pass these heights in. You don't,
right? Oh, yeah. I can make them uh
right? Oh, yeah. I can make them uh
configurable. You don't have to. I just
configurable. You don't have to. I just
wanted to.
wanted to.
It's cuz you don't want to have to build
It's cuz you don't want to have to build
over and over, you know? That's uh the
over and over, you know? That's uh the
power of having a lot of these variables
power of having a lot of these variables
configurable like in the Well, this is
configurable like in the Well, this is
just my build system's just stupid. It
just my build system's just stupid. It
should literally take 4 seconds. It
should literally take 4 seconds. It
should take like 3 seconds to build.
Right now, you just have a lot of you're
Right now, you just have a lot of you're
just building a lot of environments.
just building a lot of environments.
Yeah, you should just be able to build
Yeah, you should just be able to build
the one. Mhm.
the one. Mhm.
like make it so that it's it's kind of
like make it so that it's it's kind of
like make where if nothing changed,
like make where if nothing changed,
don't compile it. That should just be CC
don't compile it. That should just be CC
cache.
cache.
Yeah.
Um, if you want to look at the hang on
Um, if you want to look at the hang on
this is
protected
by Hang Hang on. How does this make
by Hang Hang on. How does this make
sense?
sense?
Um, it's just the average. It's just So
Um, it's just the average. It's just So
the average since I'm only
the average since I'm only
uh Wait. Yeah. Let me looks wrong. Let
uh Wait. Yeah. Let me looks wrong. Let
me try something. Right. No, no, no. You
me try something. Right. No, no, no. You
can remove
can remove
the the absolute value.
What? Huh? No. So, so the protected
What? Huh? No. So, so the protected
distance sum is like
distance sum is like
it's it's a little more complicated than
it's it's a little more complicated than
just who is inside the protected range
just who is inside the protected range
versus who is not. It's not like a
versus who is not. It's not like a
binary. It's continuous. I made it so
binary. It's continuous. I made it so
that I see.
that I see.
Yeah. But like, yeah, because this is on
Yeah. But like, yeah, because this is on
zero. Um,
zero. Um,
so it's like if a lot of the voids are
so it's like if a lot of the voids are
in the protected range but are in the in
in the protected range but are in the in
like the edges of it in the perimeter,
like the edges of it in the perimeter,
um, it won't,
um, it won't,
um, it won't, I guess, but this doesn't
um, it won't, I guess, but this doesn't
like punish you as much.
like punish you as much.
So, if that makes sense. like like
So, if that makes sense. like like
the farther away a boy is from its uh
the farther away a boy is from its uh
from its basically the closer one um
from its basically the closer one um
another boy is to the current void the
another boy is to the current void the
higher the punishment the further away
higher the punishment the further away
it is from the from it but it's it can
it is from the from it but it's it can
still be in the protected range um of
still be in the protected range um of
course it's going to get um punished
course it's going to get um punished
less I'm confused why I have zero score
less I'm confused why I have zero score
here from this
uh I don't know that's uh maybe you have
uh I don't know that's uh maybe you have
no protected count
no protected count
which can see is the only way I don't
know it's probably going to be random I
know it's probably going to be random I
think
oh yeah okay that's the opposite they're
oh yeah okay that's the opposite they're
all grouped up Yeah. So protected
all grouped up Yeah. So protected
count if disc is less than protected
count if disc is less than protected
range this gets incremented
wait well that that one yeah but this
wait well that that one yeah but this
sum is
I'm confused this should shouldn't this
I'm confused this should shouldn't this
be they should be getting negative a ton
be they should be getting negative a ton
of reward.
So, um I do Yes, I do punish them. If
So, um I do Yes, I do punish them. If
you take a look at that, that's a minus
you take a look at that, that's a minus
equal. Oh, well. Yeah, you can make it.
equal. Oh, well. Yeah, you can make it.
I'm trying it. Thank you. Yeah, you can
I'm trying it. Thank you. Yeah, you can
make it. Oh, it doesn't seem I'm seeing
make it. Oh, it doesn't seem I'm seeing
zero score either way. Oh, is it just
zero score either way. Oh, is it just
not getting logged?
not getting logged?
[Music]
I think there's just
Nope. It was logging before. I don't
Nope. It was logging before. I don't
know. No, I think
should be getting logged. I don't know.
should be getting logged. I don't know.
Yeah, this is probably going to be the
Yeah, this is probably going to be the
same
result.
Yep. Yeah. Okay. So then this this has
Yep. Yeah. Okay. So then this this has
to be zero. this protected count.
to be zero. this protected count.
Uh yeah, I think you're just prot I
Uh yeah, I think you're just prot I
think the range is just not high enough.
think the range is just not high enough.
Maybe your range is I set your range to
Maybe your range is I set your range to
50.
Okay.
Okay.
Ah yeah.
Ah yeah.
Oh okay. I think I know why. So you know
Oh okay. I think I know why. So you know
well
um
um
the well so you know how kind of each

be h that might be a reason, but I don't
be h that might be a reason, but I don't
know. I Why
know. I Why
is I mean I can you can take manual
is I mean I can you can take manual
control over them during eval and you
control over them during eval and you
can print the reward and see what it is,
can print the reward and see what it is,
but I have an idea.
[Music]
Okay. I thought that would be it.
Okay. I thought that would be it.
Yeah, I think you're just not getting
Yeah, I think you're just not getting
Did I really Did I rebuild it? I did.
Did I really Did I rebuild it? I did.
Maybe not. You did.
Maybe not. You did.
Okay.
Um I mean
Um I mean
logging is broken. How is logging
logging is broken. How is logging

broken? Bet.
Well, logging is broken because they're

Well, I don't think it's I think it's
Well, I don't think it's I think it's
the calc itself that's broken.
the calc itself that's broken.
Well, yeah, it's not logging broken. I
Well, yeah, it's not logging broken. I
made them all zeros besides score. Score
made them all zeros besides score. Score
and n are the only ones I put stuff

Yeah, that's confusing for now. Well,
Yeah, that's confusing for now. Well,
those I can remove them. I just didn't
those I can remove them. I just didn't
remove them. I was just in the middle of
remove them. I was just in the middle of

I've I've gotten a few environments
I've I've gotten a few environments
working in the last day or so. Bet.
Yeah, I would I would hope so, Joseph.
Yeah, I would I would hope so, Joseph.
Okay. No, there are protected count. Why
Okay. No, there are protected count. Why
is it not?
That was more for plasma versus for you.
That was more for plasma versus for you.
Yeah. Um, so the waste core gets
Yeah. Um, so the waste core gets
calculated is just
calculated is just
I bet you this avoid factor isn't
I bet you this avoid factor isn't
getting set.
getting set.
I just start logging stuff at this
I just start logging stuff at this

Void factor. Just just printing printing
Void factor. Just just printing printing

p.m. if you submit some interesting code
p.m. if you submit some interesting code
to Puffer Lip.
Yeah, I still got a long way to go with
Yeah, I still got a long way to go with
these, but it takes time.
these, but it takes time.
All right, so what I'm learning a lot.
All right, so what I'm learning a lot.
Yeah, now score is still zero. So what
Yeah, now score is still zero. So what
do you what do you do with score?
do you what do you do with score?
Score I just set it to the um reward
Score I just set it to the um reward
that is calculated on the three lines
that is calculated on the three lines
above it. So the ends rewards current
above it. So the ends rewards current
index equals current void reward /
index equals current void reward /
two and just set it to that.
two and just set it to that.
And current void reward is what?
I see. It's
I see. It's
a complex calculation.
a complex calculation.
No, really. No, it's just average score
No, really. No, it's just average score
is just average. If that's what you're
is just average. If that's what you're
talking about,
maybe we should print current void
maybe we should print current void
reward. Oh, you have this as
uh some like dumb cast or some
uh some like dumb cast or some
ridiculous thing happening here is my
ridiculous thing happening here is my
guess.
guess.
Oh, Numbboys is unsigned. So,
Oh, Numbboys is unsigned. So,
does that get promoted?
Still zero. I don't think Oh, wait. No,
Still zero. I don't think Oh, wait. No,
there's the first zero now. Oh,
there's the first zero now. Oh,
okay. So, that might have been it. The
okay. So, that might have been it. The
plot thickens.
plot thickens.
Yeah, that definitely is uh is telling.
Yeah, that definitely is uh is telling.
It's something to do with current void
It's something to do with current void
reward or with that particular cast.
if one of your logging things gets uh
if one of your logging things gets uh
gets re, you know, recast as something.
gets re, you know, recast as something.
Okay, the score now is working. Let's
Okay, the score now is working. Let's
see if it learns.
And this is continuous actions, right?
And this is continuous actions, right?
No, I have it on discrete.
No, I have it on discrete.
Okay.
Okay.
So that I uh I checked the cart pole. So
So that I uh I checked the cart pole. So
with your args, it still trains. It's
with your args, it still trains. It's
not that I broke continuous actions.
not that I broke continuous actions.
It's just that they've always been worse
It's just that they've always been worse
than discreet. And because of the new
than discreet. And because of the new
optimizer changes, our new optimizer
optimizer changes, our new optimizer
like is able to get really aggressive
like is able to get really aggressive
hyperparams for discrete and
hyperparams for discrete and
multi-discreet, but for whatever reason,
multi-discreet, but for whatever reason,
you can't for continuous.
you can't for continuous.
Oh, okay. It's more subtle than just I
Oh, okay. It's more subtle than just I
screwed something up, I think. Okay,
screwed something up, I think. Okay,
good to know. The the the main issue
good to know. The the the main issue
with continuous was that that we would
with continuous was that that we would
just hit hard torch
just hit hard torch
errors. That was No, I fixed that. It's
errors. That was No, I fixed that. It's
it's numerically unstable. Okay. Well,
it's numerically unstable. Okay. Well,
yeah, thank you for telling me before
yeah, thank you for telling me before
I instead instead of uh saying, "Oh,
I instead instead of uh saying, "Oh,
yeah. Yeah, it's fixed, but knowing
yeah. Yeah, it's fixed, but knowing
secretly that it's probably not going to

work." So, does it does it work with
work." So, does it does it work with
like Adam or something?
like Adam or something?
Uh I tried that and no I still couldn't
Uh I tried that and no I still couldn't
get it to work with our aggressive
get it to work with our aggressive
parameters with very very like cartpole
parameters with very very like cartpole
stable enough to solve it in continuous
stable enough to solve it in continuous
you can solve uh if you just take muon
you can solve uh if you just take muon
and lower the learning rate it'll be
and lower the learning rate it'll be
stable for long enough to solve it but
stable for long enough to solve it but
it will eventually explode. Um and I've
it will eventually explode. Um and I've
seen that pretty consistently across
seen that pretty consistently across
everything.
everything.
Oh interesting exploding
Oh interesting exploding
bad. Uh oh that's because it it worked
bad. Uh oh that's because it it worked
really well before. No it didn't. I uh I
really well before. No it didn't. I uh I
checked your thing and it was just
checked your thing and it was just
because of your params. Like if you set
because of your params. Like if you set
more aggressive params, it doesn't.
No. Okay, that looks well. They're doing
No. Okay, that looks well. They're doing
something. Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah, that
something. Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah, that
looks about right. The puffer sim.
looks about right. The puffer sim.
There you go. They're This kind of like

Okay. Maybe can you try it with this
reward doesn't make sense to me still?
reward doesn't make sense to me still?
It's like the magnitude off. Oh, okay.
It's like the magnitude off. Oh, okay.
So, well, I can kind of explain this or
So, well, I can kind of explain this or
anything like
anything like

it's not 64 because not all

that 32 and then you all at on the end

um the uh one of like matching uh
um the uh one of like matching uh
velocities and position like average
velocities and position like average
velocities and position. So there's the
velocities and position. So there's the
centering factor which is average

Yeah. So like um the voids
Yeah. So like um the voids
um try to basically have the uh average
um try to basically have the uh average
velocity of voids in its uh visual range
velocity of voids in its uh visual range
or whatever. But for now, yeah, you can
or whatever. But for now, yeah, you can
see everything. It just the reward only
see everything. It just the reward only
um applies in a certain range.
That one is for the velocity. Yeah, the
That one is for the velocity. Yeah, the

I learned a lot though building this and
I'm learning literally every time you

Depends on the thing. Yeah. What are you
Depends on the thing. Yeah. What are you
talking about specifically? In in
talking about specifically? In in
Python, step is almost always referred
Python, step is almost always referred
to as tick and time out is referred to

used for steps and, uh, time test is
used for steps and, uh, time test is
used instead of timeout, but they both
used instead of timeout, but they both
do the same thing. We should probably
do the same thing. We should probably
keep it the same, but I mean, that's
keep it the same, but I mean, that's
really pedantic. Honestly, I care so
really pedantic. Honestly, I care so
much more about stuff like not having a

Okay.
Okay.
Like it's like if you're going to look

Yeah, for me.
Yeah, for me.
Okay. Well, I guess what should it do?
Okay. Well, I guess what should it do?
Theoretically, it should try just match

Yeah. Yeah, they are.
Yeah. You get some like It looks like

Run in
Run in

Yeah, it'll look cooler if you do not
Yeah, it'll look cooler if you do not
match velocity.
Well, that's the thing. We're going to
Well, that's the thing. We're going to
have it's a tunable factor, so you can,
have it's a tunable factor, so you can,
you know.
you know.
Oh, I see what's happened
Oh, I see what's happened
here. Okay. Also, my steps per second

very low.
Oh, poor you. You only get to train at
Oh, poor you. You only get to train at
1.5 million steps per second. Mhm. Dude,
1.5 million steps per second. Mhm. Dude,
look at look at how much the ends the
look at look at how much the ends the

It's like 2% too much. Yeah. Should be

it should be zero. Should take zero,
it should be zero. Should take zero,
right? They're well you
know only 1.5 million
I've
tr experiment to see is when you turn on

that. Like, yeah. What would happen if
you put a void factor, you know, like if
you put a void factor, you know, like if
you put Well, they're they're kind of

You're just You're just happy. I just

like Yeah. I'm not going to lie. Puffers
here. Have some puffers.
Yeah. They don't they don't collide with

the right call is to make them like be
the right call is to make them like be
able to go through each other. No, it's
able to go through each other. No, it's
the thing is like we got to tune do a

also. Um, so for the avoidance reward,
um, like my original, uh, avoidance
um, like my original, uh, avoidance
reward, I would like to try to explain

it to you and you may be telling me
it to you and you may be telling me
like, is this a good idea? Is this bad?
like, is this a good idea? Is this bad?
And like why it's bad, why it's good or
And like why it's bad, why it's good or
kind of thing or like, well, I'm mostly
kind of thing or like, well, I'm mostly
looking for why it's bad. Hang on. But
looking for why it's bad. Hang on. But
yeah, let me do
yeah, let me do

Okay, there we go.
This gets like
This gets like

Okay, that's not good.
So what's gamma
So what's gamma
discount factor? What's gamma
discount factor? What's gamma
discount factor? Gamma is very

Okay, I guess yeah, I need to I need to
Okay, I guess yeah, I need to I need to
um look more into RL and like read some
um look more into RL and like read some
papers, read some I have a blog for you.

Is it my blog post? What's Costas? Well,
Is it my blog post? What's Costas? Well,
that is that is one of the ones I
that is that is one of the ones I
recommend in my blog post. I'll give you

I also have a massive list of various
I also have a massive list of various

resources. So, if you want any, just DM
me. I'll DM you then. But also, I guess
me. I'll DM you then. But also, I guess
um for prerequisites. Um, should I? Cuz
um for prerequisites. Um, should I? Cuz
right now I'm kind of in the middle of

This one's took me like 10 times
worth 10 minutes.
Mhm. Jesus

correctly. That one took like 10 N's
correctly. That one took like 10 N's
worth.
Wait, what are you doing to format it?
Wait, what are you doing to format it?
Uh, just normalizing variable names and

pretty decent, but it's also the first
pretty decent, but it's also the first
major piece of C that I had to write.
So that's 2.0. What am I
So that's 2.0. What am I
doing? Okay, there we go.
material squared and target cleaned

Now we just
make you a network.

puffer lib ocean and it switches to 2.0
ask me.
Nice. Okay, perfect.
Now I just need the pencil.
Now I just need the pencil.
Yep. Nice.
Yep. Nice.
Okay.
Interesting. Outline
Interesting. Outline
pencil pen. Just
nice. Nice. I got a puffer white board.
nice. Nice. I got a puffer white board.
Sketchboard buffer themed
sketchboard. Yeah, it's basically the
sketchboard. Yeah, it's basically the
same thing. Uh, in fact, your PIS script
same thing. Uh, in fact, your PIS script
is essentially basically how I'm
is essentially basically how I'm
rewriting it with the um target SPS
rewriting it with the um target SPS
being like the only main thing
different. And you also changed Yeah,
different. And you also changed Yeah,
you you changed ticks to step as well.
you you changed ticks to step as well.
So that's that's funny.
What What did I change to steps? Um,
What What did I change to steps? Um,
yeah. So in I just do that in the perf
yeah. So in I just do that in the perf
test cuz I I the reason I do that is cuz
test cuz I I the reason I do that is cuz
like ticks is like when you're like in
like ticks is like when you're like in
the internals of the game, it's the
the internals of the game, it's the
number of game ticks or whatever. Yeah.
number of game ticks or whatever. Yeah.
So yeah, that's why I usually do that.
So yeah, that's why I usually do that.
Yeah, a lot of the older M's have ticks
Yeah, a lot of the older M's have ticks
instead. Yeah, tick is fine. Steps is
instead. Yeah, tick is fine. Steps is
fine. It doesn't matter that much.
fine. It doesn't matter that much.
Yeah, it depends because like the thing
Yeah, it depends because like the thing
is tick is like for a neural MMO
is tick is like for a neural MMO
specifically like the tick system is a
specifically like the tick system is a
common thing that you to talk about in
common thing that you to talk about in
like an MMO.
Yep. It's also confusing steps is more
Yep. It's also confusing steps is more
straightforward. That's fine.
I'm nitpicky.
I'm nitpicky.
Okay, here we go. Um, I can commit this
Okay, here we go. Um, I can commit this
now. Oh, cuz I keep Oh, that's why cuz I
now. Oh, cuz I keep Oh, that's why cuz I
have two tabs open. That's probably why
have two tabs open. That's probably why
it's defaulting to
it's defaulting to
2.0.

Okay, that's fixed. Okay.
Okay, that's fixed. Okay.
Okay,

Oh, hello.
Do you want the Perf test for the Python
Do you want the Perf test for the Python

you want it to be its own function?
you want it to be its own function?
Uh I put it in the main so that you can
Uh I put it in the main so that you can
run that the class directly. You can
run that the class directly. You can
just run the script.
Not that there are two.
I
see one of the first fundamental then
see one of the first fundamental then
skip right to

rainbow. Ah okay. Yeah I need to
understand
understand
that. Mhm.
[Music]
I'm done.
Oh,
interesting. Appealing as an impressive
interesting. Appealing as an impressive

Ah, for some reason in target.py Pi you
Ah, for some reason in target.py Pi you
have I and steps and they both function
have I and steps and they both function
as the same variable where in target.py
as the same variable where in target.py
pi unless I'm blind but I controlled F
pi unless I'm blind but I controlled F
and I couldn't find any use for it where

steps wouldn't be in normally.
steps wouldn't be in normally.
Steps get incremented by num agent so I
Steps get incremented by num agent so I
get to incremented by one.
get to incremented by one.
Ah and it's I% cache. Gotcha.
I love your description of multi- aent
I love your description of multi- aent
RL.
RL.
What? his his description of multi- aent
What? his his description of multi- aent
RL in his uh blog post is it's the same
RL in his uh blog post is it's the same
as as single agent RL except uh that the
as as single agent RL except uh that the
environments and tools are
jank. Oh, I see what's happened here in
jank. Oh, I see what's happened here in
the Okay.
Well,
well, this certainly is a good job of
well, this certainly is a good job of
slowing it the hell down.
slowing it the hell down.
Oh, uh, the new neural net. Yeah, there
Oh, uh, the new neural net. Yeah, there
we go. Okay. What what what are
we go. Okay. What what what are
architecture? Are you just doing a lot
architecture? Are you just doing a lot
of LSTMs or groups? Pointwise
of LSTMs or groups? Pointwise
architecture. So, it's it encodes all
architecture. So, it's it encodes all
the voids the same. So, it's
the voids the same. So, it's
positionally independent.
Um, I don't
Um, I don't
know if it doesn't Does it learn any
know if it doesn't Does it learn any
better? No idea. Probably not.
I think you got to like do some work on
I think you got to like do some work on
like the dynamics of this thing. Like it
like the dynamics of this thing. Like it
should be you should be able to get like
should be you should be able to get like
these nice swarm things out of it.
these nice swarm things out of it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm going to give you I'm going to
I'm going to give you I'm going to
commit all this stuff up to you. You
commit all this stuff up to you. You
don't have to use this net. You can go
don't have to use this net. You can go
back to the default one. I'm gonna give
back to the default one. I'm gonna give
you all the stuff that I've done for
you all the stuff that I've done for
now. Yeah. Um, where are you going to
now. Yeah. Um, where are you going to
commit it?
Dev.
Dev.
Okay,
Okay,
sure. Okay, I simplified it out so I
sure. Okay, I simplified it out so I
isn't used anymore and used the old
isn't used anymore and used the old
version. I think that's it's it's more
version. I think that's it's it's more
easy to look at, at least in my opinion.
easy to look at, at least in my opinion.
It removes an extra variable that you
It removes an extra variable that you
don't need.
So, what would be I guess I was going to
So, what would be I guess I was going to
make a reference to a very old cartoon
make a reference to a very old cartoon
and then I realized that you weren't
and then I realized that you weren't
alive for that.
alive for that.
You'd be surprised. I might have not
You'd be surprised. I might have not
been alive, but I might have seen it. I
been alive, but I might have seen it. I
have no clue. My dad is a boomer, so I
have no clue. My dad is a boomer, so I
have seen a lot of old stuff.
have seen a lot of old stuff.
I'm a bunch of old
So, what should be kind of my next
So, what should be kind of my next
steps? Is it just adjusting rewards or
steps? Is it just adjusting rewards or
you're going to have to I You're going
you're going to have to I You're going
to have to adjust the rewards. You're
to have to adjust the rewards. You're
going to have to get [ __ ] normalized.
going to have to get [ __ ] normalized.
Um, right. Like RL's not going to
Um, right. Like RL's not going to
respond to like, well, if they're two
respond to like, well, if they're two
voids next to me, I get negative. two
voids next to me, I get negative. two
reward, but if there three voids next to
reward, but if there three voids next to
me, I get negative03 reward.
me, I get negative03 reward.
Like you it's like you got to give it a
Like you it's like you got to give it a
signal it can actually learn off of
signal it can actually learn off of
which is why it's like all right one boy
which is why it's like all right one boy
near you's negative quarter, two boys is
near you's negative quarter, two boys is
negative a half, you know, whatever. I
negative a half, you know, whatever. I
got to cap the rules. So very simple
got to cap the rules. So very simple
kind of just Yeah. very overthink it.
kind of just Yeah. very overthink it.
Mhm. And then like I I think that you
Mhm. And then like I I think that you
want to like look at the original the
want to like look at the original the
original rules right from that end and
original rules right from that end and
see if you can get
see if you can get
like it's probably like the alignment
like it's probably like the alignment
and the dispersion that are the most
and the dispersion that are the most
important right. Um yeah, the the
important right. Um yeah, the the
alignment and the um avoidance.
Well, is it is it just avoidance?
Well, is it is it just avoidance?
The [ __ ] There's a I don't know. I can
The [ __ ] There's a I don't know. I can
give you the Cornell the Cornell one.
give you the Cornell the Cornell one.
Well, you can look it up. Just voids.
Well, you can look it up. Just voids.
Cornell. Yeah, this thing. So, like
Cornell. Yeah, this thing. So, like
Well, separation.
Well, separation.
Oh, but it's coherence, right? So it's
Oh, but it's coherence, right? So it's
coherence coherence separation
coherence coherence separation
alignment. Yeah, you need these. I I
alignment. Yeah, you need these. I I
have um
have um
but yeah, I can I guess I mean I can
but yeah, I can I guess I mean I can
name them coherence separation. I don't
name them coherence separation. I don't
care the name. It's just you got to like
care the name. It's just you got to like
I there was a lot of normalization and
I there was a lot of normalization and

jank and weird things going on. So like
you got to get like you got to get these
you got to get like you got to get these
in a way that they can be very
in a way that they can be very
learnable. I think that like once you
learnable. I think that like once you
get a nice clean version of this, it
get a nice clean version of this, it
should be very easy to just instantly
should be very easy to just instantly
learn this type of behavior and it'll be
learn this type of behavior and it'll be
really cool to have. Okay. Yeah, it
really cool to have. Okay. Yeah, it
might be that like here, look at this.
might be that like here, look at this.
So, they have like this coherence.

that's easy. There's not a crazy big
that's easy. There's not a crazy big
markup. They're actually they're pretty
markup. They're actually they're pretty
good. Um, yeah, it's just the chips are
good. Um, yeah, it's just the chips are
expensive. Nvidia's like, yeah. Anyways,
expensive. Nvidia's like, yeah. Anyways,
it's very simple. See you, Joseph. We
it's very simple. See you, Joseph. We
got we got a lot of stuff. So, there's

We've got some progress on Boyds here.
Um, so I think that tomorrow, oh, I also
Um, so I think that tomorrow, oh, I also
shipped the initial dev container. It's
shipped the initial dev container. It's
on the Docker Hub at the moment. and I
on the Docker Hub at the moment. and I
got to slim it down and I got to make
got to slim it down and I got to make
some fixes to it. But I think that
some fixes to it. But I think that
probably tomorrow I'm going to start I'm
probably tomorrow I'm going to start I'm
going to spend like a couple hours
going to spend like a couple hours
finishing docks and then I'm going to
finishing docks and then I'm going to
try to just like hammer out as many

get to like the final experiments, final
ablations, put it all together. This
ablations, put it all together. This
thing has just got to ship. The longer
thing has just got to ship. The longer
this thing goes without shipping, the
this thing goes without shipping, the
