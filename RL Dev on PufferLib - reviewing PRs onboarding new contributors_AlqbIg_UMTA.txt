okay we are
alive are let me
see
oops we got some stuff to do today uh
oops we got some stuff to do today uh
first of
first of
all I realized like the Mev just hasn't
all I realized like the Mev just hasn't
been going fast enough I really needed
been going fast enough I really needed
to be doing more on the promo side to
to be doing more on the promo side to
get more people interested in
get more people interested in
contributing because they're just simply
contributing because they're just simply
too many environments and that went very
too many environments and that went very
very well this morning we got a whole
very well this morning we got a whole
bunch of DMS from new people who are
bunch of DMS from new people who are
looking to contribute to stuff which is
looking to contribute to stuff which is
awesome um so if you're one of those and
awesome um so if you're one of those and
watching this then I'm happy to get you
watching this then I'm happy to get you
set up right
set up right
now uh in the meantime though I'm going
now uh in the meantime though I'm going
to start going over PRS and such
to start going over PRS and such
from contributors I think we have one
got one here
whoops where is
it some aray
I'm going to have to merge uh the
I'm going to have to merge uh the
breakout fixes I think um let me
breakout fixes I think um let me
see obvious standouts at the moment
let me see
let me see what else what else can I get
let me see what else what else can I get
people to do
we'll try and what else do we haveg
crunch time
okay so that's some good stuff to start
okay so that's some good stuff to start
with
with
there
um that's some good stuff to start with
um that's some good stuff to start with
there
[Music]
very
very
good let's get the uh this PR
good let's get the uh this PR
here
here
so large refactor
so large refactor
to
to
[Music]
[Music]
use
bitboard 49
bitboard 49
bits okay that's
interesting this is
interesting this is
clever yeah this is clever this is more
clever yeah this is clever this is more
than I would expect from a lot of new
than I would expect from a lot of new
contributors actually this is good good
contributors actually this is good good
work if he actually did
this this is nice Oh Hey
this this is nice Oh Hey
Jake if you actually implemented this
Jake if you actually implemented this
type of stuff well done this is more
type of stuff well done this is more
than I expect from uh a lot of
than I expect from uh a lot of
contributors that's
contributors that's
uh this is cool actually doing some mask
stuff what did this guy do this guy did
stuff what did this guy do this guy did
it in
it in
uh
uh
solver this SM C++
Shenanigans yeah so I'm assuming that
Shenanigans yeah so I'm assuming that
your implementation will actually be a
your implementation will actually be a
lot simpler than this stuff here
Tech debt to some
Tech debt to some
degree I think it's technical debt to
degree I think it's technical debt to
some degree not sure the tradeoff is
some degree not sure the tradeoff is
good enough um well it depends on let's
good enough um well it depends on let's
let's look at the code here
so yeah this is just so it's all in
here I mean I don't mind lowlevel stuff
here I mean I don't mind lowlevel stuff
like this it's actually fine what I mind
like this it's actually fine what I mind
is generally abstraction and structure
is generally abstraction and structure
sure
sure
um having like a file that's 350 lines
um having like a file that's 350 lines
for Connect 4 is good like what I mind
for Connect 4 is good like what I mind
is when you get just like tons of layers
is when you get just like tons of layers
of that like you can't just
of that like you can't just
read the code top to
read the code top to
bottom I still don't know what I want to
bottom I still don't know what I want to
do with these log buffers cuz
do with these log buffers cuz
like I kind of like that it's just
like I kind of like that it's just
separate per file like this um but it
separate per file like this um but it
does mean you have to paste in 50 lines
does mean you have to paste in 50 lines
at the
at the
top the way I just ified this in my head
top the way I just ified this in my head
was like so there is an include of
was like so there is an include of
puffer net. but that include is only for
puffer net. but that include is only for
uh the compiled demo right so when you
uh the compiled demo right so when you
come when you use the scon code uh it's
come when you use the scon code uh it's
just binding theh so it has no
just binding theh so it has no
dependencies that's how I Justified this
dependencies that's how I Justified this
layout in my
layout in my
head okay we got connect
head okay we got connect
for
for
position mask
obervations this is
good
Char
okay uh you don't need to make um you
okay uh you don't need to make um you
don't need to make methods like this uh
don't need to make methods like this uh
if they're going to be empty there
if they're going to be empty there
there's not like an actual API it's the
there's not like an actual API it's the
way to think about this is It's a
way to think about this is It's a
convention not a not an API right so
convention not a not an API right so
what I do is I make an init method that
what I do is I make an init method that
gets called um from like the C file if
gets called um from like the C file if
needed right in order to do any setup or
needed right in order to do any setup or
no other way around it's called from
no other way around it's called from
scyon to do any setup if needed and then
scyon to do any setup if needed and then
the allocate method it's because you
the allocate method it's because you
need these extra buffers if you're going
need these extra buffers if you're going
to use it from purec so I just use a
to use it from purec so I just use a
knit and allocate as conventions and I
knit and allocate as conventions and I
also I'll use like make if it returns an
also I'll use like make if it returns an
object
object
but it's just it's a convention it's not
but it's just it's a convention it's not
an API so you don't ever need to feel
an API so you don't ever need to feel
obligated to put like empty methods for
stuff from syon as well yeah well I I
stuff from syon as well yeah well I I
mean you can if you want if you're able
mean you can if you want if you're able
to do that right now and just update it
to do that right now and just update it
then you can do that otherwise I'll just
then you can do that otherwise I'll just
do it when I pull it in right I mean I'm
do it when I pull it in right I mean I'm
not just a merge button I'm able to edit
not just a merge button I'm able to edit
code myself too
okay this is
good top
good top
mask bottom
mask top
mask what is this
oh it's going to
be the
top check if the last cell is
top check if the last cell is
free okay so this is the top mask
yeah I understand
and then the bottom
and then the bottom
mask I don't know what you use this for
mask I don't know what you use this for
but
but
sure and then
bottom I actually don't understand what
bottom I actually don't understand what
these masks are for uh we'll see so
these masks are for uh we'll see so
valid
move you can probably actually inline
move you can probably actually inline
some of these as well I don't know if
some of these as well I don't know if
that'll matter valid
that'll matter valid
move mask and top mask equals
move mask and top mask equals
zero I don't know what this mask
zero I don't know what this mask
is
play or equals

what oh I get it it's this is that the
what oh I get it it's this is that the
board is full right yeah yeah this is
board is full right yeah yeah this is
the board is full so I don't like to
the board is full so I don't like to
comment stuff very often like I'm pretty
comment stuff very often like I'm pretty
sparse on comments usually but stuff
sparse on comments usually but stuff
like this where it's like bit
like this where it's like bit
logic um this could definitely use a
logic um this could definitely use a
couple like I get what the top mask is
couple like I get what the top mask is
for I don't necessarily get why there's
for I don't necessarily get why there's
a bottom mask and stuff I get I can
a bottom mask and stuff I get I can
figure out that this is this is the full
figure out that this is this is the full
board
state but yeah either comments are more
state but yeah either comments are more
judicious naming when you have lowl
judicious naming when you have lowl
stuff like this would be nice this is
stuff like this would be nice this is
overall though this is very nice and
overall though this is very nice and
readable like this is so far I'm fine
readable like this is so far I'm fine
with
this
one
if okay I see that this is these are
if okay I see that this is these are
checks I have no idea how these work but
checks I have no idea how these work but
uh yeah this is going to be I imagine
uh yeah this is going to be I imagine
that this is a clever bit of stuff
that this is a clever bit of stuff
designed in this post with bit masking
designed in this post with bit masking
cool reviewing it cringing no you're
cool reviewing it cringing no you're
actually this code is pretty darn good
actually this code is pretty darn good
honestly um like stuff like this like if
honestly um like stuff like this like if
you want to you could just name this
you want to you could just name this
like board full or something and it
like board full or something and it
wouldn't even need a comment right
um but yeah I don't I don't actually
um but yeah I don't I don't actually
like code that's like super heavily
like code that's like super heavily
commented stuff should usually be self
commented stuff should usually be self
explanatory it's basically only when you
explanatory it's basically only when you
have stuff that's like clever bit math
have stuff that's like clever bit math
or something like this where you should
or something like this where you should
need like a couple very short things
need like a couple very short things
like I just don't understand for
like I just don't understand for
instance like okay I can figure out this
instance like okay I can figure out this
top mask this is like this is like a
top mask this is like this is like a
floating mask at the top
floating mask at the top
of I think that this is a floating mask
of I think that this is a floating mask
for like where you've played the top
for like where you've played the top
cell I think or no wait it's just the
cell I think or no wait it's just the
top the top row
top the top row
yeah so there's some details where it's
yeah so there's some details where it's
like it's hard to just read from the bit
like it's hard to just read from the bit
math cuz this is like clever stuff that
math cuz this is like clever stuff that
you have to kind of unpack right this
you have to kind of unpack right this
isn't like normal
isn't like normal
code minmax is
fine yeah yeah everybody should know
fine yeah yeah everybody should know
what Mini Max is you don't have to go
what Mini Max is you don't have to go
crazy

here if maximizing player win plus whenn
here if maximizing player win plus whenn
minus discount discount short

games interesting
depth and then is this recursive let's
see this type of thing is fine I'd
see this type of thing is fine I'd
probably use a Turner for stuff like
probably use a Turner for stuff like
this but that's a total nitpick has
this but that's a total nitpick has
onboarding finished nope I'm uh I am
onboarding finished nope I'm uh I am
here all day to onboard people and to
here all day to onboard people and to
answer questions and stuff I'm currently
answer questions and stuff I'm currently
taking a let me like finish reviewing
taking a let me like finish reviewing
this code bit but if you want uh if you
this code bit but if you want uh if you
want some input on how to get started
want some input on how to get started
and what might be a good spot that's
and what might be a good spot that's
what I'm here for the goal for today is
what I'm here for the goal for today is
to like merge some code get some people
to like merge some code get some people
up to speed and work on a couple M
up to speed and work on a couple M
things
things
myself without the disc count it stops
myself without the disc count it stops
trying
trying
early uh
early uh
interesting
so it has been seven or eight years
so it has been seven or eight years
since I've seen min max explicitly done
since I've seen min max explicitly done
let me see
one yeah I have some very minor
one yeah I have some very minor
alterations to some code I don't know uh
alterations to some code I don't know uh
I don't know Jake if it would be helpful
I don't know Jake if it would be helpful
for once you submit that if it would be
for once you submit that if it would be
helpful for you to watch me refactor a
helpful for you to watch me refactor a
couple small things live um I think
couple small things live um I think
generally your code is very good here I
generally your code is very good here I
have like a couple small nitpicks with
have like a couple small nitpicks with
things but this is is overall this is
things but this is is overall this is
well above the bar for puffer this is
well above the bar for puffer this is
well above the bar there are a few
well above the bar there are a few
things that can be improved just a
things that can be improved just a
little bit um but I'm very much
nitpicking also I'm realizing that we're
nitpicking also I'm realizing that we're
probably going to horrify some people
probably going to horrify some people
watching this you do not have to know
watching this you do not have to know
how to do a bunch of bit math and Logic
how to do a bunch of bit math and Logic
for most of the environments this is a
for most of the environments this is a
special case most of the things will not
special case most of the things will not
be like
be like
this if it's going to lose in three
this if it's going to lose in three
steps it treats the first and second
steps it treats the first and second
step as lost I'll put some changes and
step as lost I'll put some changes and
then you can go wild yeah perfect okay
then you can go wild yeah perfect okay
that's interesting I'd have to look at
that's interesting I'd have to look at
the algorithm for that so it's not valid
the algorithm for that so it's not valid
move continue yep
move continue yep
perfect uh this is and position and mask
play God I'm going to actually I have to
play God I'm going to actually I have to
look at this let me see how do this mmax
look at this let me see how do this mmax
work
so I assume that you start at a positive
so I assume that you start at a positive
depth and then if it's zero or You've
depth and then if it's zero or You've
Won or you've
draw you turn
draw you turn
okay yeah there's some stuff I can fix
okay yeah there's some stuff I can fix
here but then you would
here but then you would
return a value on the mid Max
okay
okay
and value of
game Max minus
max if it's not a valid
max if it's not a valid
move
move
okay and then what do we
okay and then what do we
do child
do child
position child mask play
oh that's funny because the whole board
oh that's funny because the whole board
state is just a a 64
okay well we're not going to be able to
okay well we're not going to be able to
easily turn this game into like connect
easily turn this game into like connect
end because of this but that's kind of
end because of this but that's kind of
fine we don't really need every
fine we don't really need every
environment to be super configurable and
environment to be super configurable and
I think I would rather just have uh
I think I would rather just have uh
Connect 4 B just Connect 4 and be fast
Connect 4 B just Connect 4 and be fast
so I'm happy with this this is fine um
so I'm happy with this this is fine um
uh child
value min
value min
max this is good position and mask swaps
max this is good position and mask swaps
the
player that wait no that's not and
player that wait no that's not and
that's uh is that
that's uh is that
exor I forget I think that's exor right
yeah okay it's been a long time since
yeah okay it's been a long time since
I've done bit level
stuff maximizing player and child
stuff maximizing player and child
value values child value
value values child value
okay
okay
wait how's this
wait how's this
work if not maximizing
player yeah xor
okay if maximize
player oh okay I see I see what this
player oh okay I see I see what this
is yeah so you have to
is yeah so you have to
basically see if
basically see if
like yeah because the score gets flipped
like yeah because the score gets flipped
okay I
okay I
see compute and
see compute and
move hardcoded opening book really
huh that's
funky I couldn't find Min and Max and
funky I couldn't find Min and Max and
C uh it's F it's F Max F or like it's
C uh it's F it's F Max F or like it's
type dependent so there's a different
type dependent so there's a different
signature depending on the type
signature depending on the type
I think it's it's either I forget if
I think it's it's either I forget if
it's output type Max input type or input
it's output type Max input type or input
Max output type but like you have like f
Max output type but like you have like f
Max F and like IMAX I and stuff like
Max F and like IMAX I and stuff like
that I
that I
think single move to opening book okay
think single move to opening book okay
that's fine we'll see how we train
that's fine we'll see how we train
against it right if we demolish this
against it right if we demolish this
thing then we'll try to make it harder
uh don't do this type of inline thing
I know that I did it uh a couple times
I know that I did it uh a couple times
in the Moa it was a
mistake child
mistake child
position child
mask
okay break ties randomly
Implement a heuristic for non-terminal
states without it you got some
states without it you got some
exploitable
openings there might be something with
openings there might be something with
seeding Jake um I noticed I think it was
seeding Jake um I noticed I think it was
always doing the same
always doing the same
move I think that there probably needs
move I think that there probably needs
to be either like a symmetry break or a
to be either like a symmetry break or a
seaing or something cuz I think right
seaing or something cuz I think right
now it'll just it'll take the first move
now it'll just it'll take the first move
or whatever that is a specific value
or whatever that is a specific value
probably there should be like if the
probably there should be like if the
values are equal right of multiple moves
values are equal right of multiple moves
it should like have a chance to switch
it should like have a chance to switch
to the new one or something maybe
to the new one or something maybe
symmetry breaking is kind of important
symmetry breaking is kind of important
cuz otherwise yeah you'll learn like
cuz otherwise yeah you'll learn like
deterministic policies that just wreck
it I'm not going to say that I fully
it I'm not going to say that I fully
understand everything here because
understand everything here because
obviously there's some lowlevel logic
obviously there's some lowlevel logic
and there's like some
and there's like some
stuff going on but I will say that the
stuff going on but I will say that the
code looks mostly quite clean with a
code looks mostly quite clean with a
couple very small nitpicks um we will
couple very small nitpicks um we will
we'll get this set up I
think let let me see
step okay this is the
same
um random
and single hardcoded seems enough
and single hardcoded seems enough
okay input player
action I assume there was something that
action I assume there was something that
used to be here
valid
move I'm not going to blame you for
move I'm not going to blame you for
stuff like this I do this all the time
stuff like this I do this all the time
right it's like you spend long enough on
right it's like you spend long enough on
something um and then you kind of just
something um and then you kind of just
stop seeing stuff until you go look at
stop seeing stuff until you go look at
it again
fresh I ship a bunch of dumb stuff all
fresh I ship a bunch of dumb stuff all
the
the
time I'm not going to I'm not going to
time I'm not going to I'm not going to
nitpick you on stuff like this cuz like
nitpick you on stuff like this cuz like
I know that you know that this is silly
I know that you know that this is silly
right the only things I'm going to
right the only things I'm going to
nitpick are things where it's like H you
nitpick are things where it's like H you
might not know that this is
might not know that this is
silly I was looking at whether I don't I
silly I was looking at whether I don't I
like this nesting pattern uh I think
like this nesting pattern uh I think
that this is probably fine the way that
that this is probably fine the way that
this is nested you could restructure it
this is nested you could restructure it
but I think I don't really think that
but I think I don't really think that
you need to
okay this is a little bit
okay this is a little bit
silly uh
silly uh
actually wait
if uh actually this is kind of
if uh actually this is kind of
okay cuz there's this else that's I
okay cuz there's this else that's I
would have like rever like flipped this
would have like rever like flipped this
if not valid move or whatever but yeah I
if not valid move or whatever but yeah I
think this is fine I might I might tweak
think this is fine I might I might tweak
a couple small
a couple small
things and then rendering is about the
things and then rendering is about the
same rendering is about the
same 400 not bad at
same 400 not bad at
all I think uh we clean this up we'll
all I think uh we clean this up we'll
get it to be probably under 400
get it to be probably under 400
total with a little bit of cleanup
total with a little bit of cleanup
including logging and everything and
including logging and everything and
this is a very nice Standalone
this is a very nice Standalone
environment and we'll have a board game
environment and we'll have a board game
for Connect
4 what do you
4 what do you
think of storage
huh I'm not sure of uh I'm not sure of
huh I'm not sure of uh I'm not sure of
the question
here is this somebody telling me that I
here is this somebody telling me that I
messed up and that my is easy to
hack oh no no no this is
C no you're good I thought that I
C no you're good I thought that I
thought you were somebody I thought you
thought you were somebody I thought you
were telling me like hey your website's
were telling me like hey your website's
garbage and I can hack it or something
garbage and I can hack it or something
like hey you're storing your access
like hey you're storing your access
token stupid no so this is um these are
token stupid no so this is um these are
environments that we have here these are
environments that we have here these are
all written in pure C and then they're
all written in pure C and then they're
compiled uh to web assembly with M
compiled uh to web assembly with M
script in so they're super super fast
script in so they're super super fast
and then the graphics for them are in
and then the graphics for them are in
rib rib is also in C so it builds to web
rib rib is also in C so it builds to web
assembly um so yeah like the actual
assembly um so yeah like the actual
front end for this is just like
front end for this is just like
index.html all this stuff is
C and ironically I actually think that
C and ironically I actually think that
that is easier than writing
that is easier than writing
JavaScript has the benefit of being very
JavaScript has the benefit of being very
fast as
[Music]
well yeah the only reason this is at all
well yeah the only reason this is at all
complicated is because of all this fancy
complicated is because of all this fancy
bit logic to go fast but this is good I
bit logic to go fast but this is good I
aspire to be this level of good okay
aspire to be this level of good okay
what if I told you that I hadn't written
what if I told you that I hadn't written
C in 10 years until 3 months
C in 10 years until 3 months
ago and then directly following that I
ago and then directly following that I
wrote this in like I don't know a few
wrote this in like I don't know a few
weeks you can kind of just learn
stuff you just got to do
stuff you just got to do
it hey this is an open source project
it hey this is an open source project
all the stuff we're doing here is open
all the stuff we're doing here is open
source we're onboarding tons of new
source we're onboarding tons of new
contributors
today welcome back awesome hey naan
today welcome back awesome hey naan
Ethan where's the guy that was asking
Ethan where's the guy that was asking
about onboarding
about onboarding
um there was a guy on Twitch that was
um there was a guy on Twitch that was
asking about onboarding if you're still
asking about onboarding if you're still
here and have questions or stuff to get
here and have questions or stuff to get
on to I'd be happy to answer stuff while
on to I'd be happy to answer stuff while
Jake is uh fixing up this PR but yeah
Jake is uh fixing up this PR but yeah
basically I posted a ton of stuff on uh
basically I posted a ton of stuff on uh
on X today like hey we need more
on X today like hey we need more
contributors cuz these M's aren't going
contributors cuz these M's aren't going
fast enough and we really like I can
fast enough and we really like I can
only write so much code myself um so
only write so much code myself um so
really the goal for the next release of
really the goal for the next release of
Li is we want to have at least 10 high
Li is we want to have at least 10 high
quality game environments or other types
quality game environments or other types
of environments varying complexity
of environments varying complexity
varying type and so on and really it's
varying type and so on and really it's
not any harder than just writing the
not any harder than just writing the
games as you would normally you don't
games as you would normally you don't
really need to know the RL side very
really need to know the RL side very
well at all in order to be productive
well at all in order to be productive
here and I can help in those areas so
here and I can help in those areas so
this is just a really great area where
this is just a really great area where
if you know how to write decent code you
if you know how to write decent code you
can help completely transform a branch
can help completely transform a branch
of science
of science
um that is the goal for
um that is the goal for
puffer hey Joseph new to puffer going to
puffer hey Joseph new to puffer going to
be digging into it a lot for production
be digging into it a lot for production
stuff not just games yeah and this is
stuff not just games yeah and this is
not just for games either like we use
not just for games either like we use
games because they're really good test
games because they're really good test
cases for reinforcement learning and
cases for reinforcement learning and
they cover a lot of ground they're
they cover a lot of ground they're
relatively easy to implement uh they're
relatively easy to implement uh they're
very easy to understand which is key and
very easy to understand which is key and
they're very good for testing out
they're very good for testing out
algorithms quickly uh we are going to
algorithms quickly uh we are going to
use this for lots of different areas and
use this for lots of different areas and
in fact puffer does have a like there is
in fact puffer does have a like there is
a a company behind puffer all the stuff
a a company behind puffer all the stuff
is free and open source uh but
is free and open source uh but
technically you can pay for like
technically you can pay for like
extended support and stuff like that and
extended support and stuff like that and
that doesn't just apply to
games but for the most part the goal is
games but for the most part the goal is
open source science and research first
open source science and research first
and
and
foremost you got any funding for puffer
foremost you got any funding for puffer
throw up some bounties and I'm happy to
throw up some bounties and I'm happy to
swap over got a crank out to make rent
swap over got a crank out to make rent
trying to write Russ and no rust yeah so
trying to write Russ and no rust yeah so
uh I will I've been very public about
uh I will I've been very public about
this there will be bounties as soon as
this there will be bounties as soon as
puffer has Revenue I just opened up
puffer has Revenue I just opened up
puffer to potential business like a
puffer to potential business like a
month ago and the business model for
month ago and the business model for
puffer is literally just you can pay for
puffer is literally just you can pay for
priority features let's say that you're
priority features let's say that you're
working on something in industry and you
working on something in industry and you
need puffer to be able to support
need puffer to be able to support
something in order for you to be able to
something in order for you to be able to
do that well or you need some eyes some
do that well or you need some eyes some
experienced R Allis on your problem
experienced R Allis on your problem
directly
directly
or you need just like extended support
or you need just like extended support
that is what puffer sells uh so as soon
that is what puffer sells uh so as soon
as I start actually doing that business
as I start actually doing that business
side of work and getting a couple of
side of work and getting a couple of
clients I will put the revenue from that
clients I will put the revenue from that
all directly back into feature bounties
all directly back into feature bounties
and hardware and stuff until then what I

that overall it's people will start
that overall it's people will start
making money as soon as I start making

money on this but for the short term my
money on this but for the short term my
goal is to just accelerate this as an

I don't know yikes like one of
I don't know yikes like one of
the one of the really cool things with
the one of the really cool things with
reinforcement learning is that you have
reinforcement learning is that you have
unlimited data um and as soon as you put
unlimited data um and as soon as you put
an R uh an llm in the loop like the llm
an R uh an llm in the loop like the llm
is so slow that you can't take advantage
is so slow that you can't take advantage
of that unlimited data so I think that
of that unlimited data so I think that
llms are going to have a huge role to
llms are going to have a huge role to
play but I think it's going to be more
play but I think it's going to be more
like you call an llm very infrequently

of validation inference would be a
of validation inference would be a
pretty big bottleneck yeah so the main
pretty big bottleneck yeah so the main
thing there is uh you don't want to run

the llm every time step right like you
the llm every time step right like you
want to run the llm once every 10,000
want to run the llm once every 10,000

what's not going to be solved if I don't
what's not going to be solved if I don't

well I'm going to be back there at the
well I'm going to be back there at the
end of the month though to do some
maintenance I guess in the meantime I
maintenance I guess in the meantime I
can start on this other project um
here let me open up the
shell for new contributors we have a uh
shell for new contributors we have a uh
a very nice just pre-built container
a very nice just pre-built container
that has puffer and everything set up in
that has puffer and everything set up in
it you don't have to use it but it's
convenient oh perfect timing
I will then I'm just going to merge your
I will then I'm just going to merge your
thing and then we'll make edits locally
thing and then we'll make edits locally
if that sounds
good
PR new changes
okay
okay
so going to go back to
this oh actually there's another thing
this oh actually there's another thing
since we have a bunch of people watching
since we have a bunch of people watching
that I haven't had the time to figure
that I haven't had the time to figure
out yet I don't know if anybody has webd
out yet I don't know if anybody has webd
experience with this um but right now we
experience with this um but right now we
build all of these environments with M
build all of these environments with M
scripton individually and then we like
scripton individually and then we like
link them onto uh the main page I would
link them onto uh the main page I would
like to have it so that we can just have
like to have it so that we can just have
one m script and build for everything
one m script and build for everything
and we can put all the environments on
and we can put all the environments on
the main page in like a two column
the main page in like a two column
format so you have like environment on
format so you have like environment on
one side and then information about the
one side and then information about the
environment on the right side and have
environment on the right side and have
like you know who made the environment
like you know who made the environment
how to control the environment stuff

Tim let me grab this and at least pull
Tim let me grab this and at least pull
this curious why ocean M header files
this curious why ocean M header files
have so much implementation versus
have so much implementation versus
putting that in the C file so theh files
putting that in the C file so theh files
get included from python we just include
get included from python we just include
theh as a standalone and then the C file
theh as a standalone and then the C file
is for uh just the pure C demo that
is for uh just the pure C demo that
doesn't run through python so if you can
doesn't run through python so if you can
build these environments just in C and
build these environments just in C and
run them in C and build them for web and
run them in C and build them for web and
put that on the web that's what the
put that on the web that's what the
little C file is the whole environment
little C file is the whole environment
logic is just in that. h and that gets
logic is just in that. h and that gets
included very easily from
scon it's like a header only setup kind
scon it's like a header only setup kind

[Music]
um yeah so I've tried to make it very
um yeah so I've tried to make it very
easy
easy
um try to make it very easy for people
um try to make it very easy for people
just like the single file format per N I
just like the single file format per N I
got rid of a lot of the old build script
got rid of a lot of the old build script
stuff that was a pain I replaced it with
stuff that was a pain I replaced it with
something
simpler let's go check out uh Connect
4 this is by Spencer and then refactored
4 this is by Spencer and then refactored
and rebuilt uh re architected I should
and rebuilt uh re architected I should
say by Jake
here does this have the perf test in it
here does this have the perf test in it
no it
doesn't hold on let me go grab the perf
doesn't hold on let me go grab the perf
test code that I just
test code that I just
deleted with this merge
for
for
how I just TP to
how I just TP to
that
what I am confused
are you on the right stream are you uh
are you on the right stream are you uh
are you typing in the right chat
here not sure what's going
on H whatever I'll just redo the perf
on H whatever I'll just redo the perf
test code real quick this is simple
test code real quick this is simple
that's a new uh that's a new Max total
that's a new uh that's a new Max total

everyone sent game on X not sure if it
everyone sent game on X not sure if it

where I can want to learn no limited
where I can want to learn no limited
about RL that's totally fine honestly
about RL that's totally fine honestly
the hard part is getting all the M's
the hard part is getting all the M's
built correctly and built fast if
built correctly and built fast if
I oh lots of
people whoa this is cool
people whoa this is cool
is this in
C wait what is this
in got three the other
in got three the other
day what is this written
in what are these blocks that are
like wait what is this written in
oh I think it's j yeah it's well is the
oh I think it's j yeah it's well is the
logic in JavaScript or is it just the
logic in JavaScript or is it just the
front
front
end uh so one of the tricky things with
end uh so one of the tricky things with
uh RL is you need the state logic to be
uh RL is you need the state logic to be
separate from the rendering and the
separate from the rendering and the
state logic has to be fast so 3D stuff
state logic has to be fast so 3D stuff
is good we actually we want more 3D
is good we actually we want more 3D
stuff but um we need the logic to be f F
stuff but um we need the logic to be f F
that doesn't mean it has to be in C but
that doesn't mean it has to be in C but
it does have to be in like something low
it does have to be in like something low
level just answer some stuff here
[Music]
[Music]
I I think there were a couple other
people it's pretty awesome to see the
people it's pretty awesome to see the
number of people interested in this
do you have a link to reading on the
do you have a link to reading on the
state portion might be able to structure
state portion might be able to structure
the code still learn uh still learning
the code still learn uh still learning
send reading uh honestly the easiest
send reading uh honestly the easiest
thing for you is going to be to look at
thing for you is going to be to look at
some of our existing environment code
some of our existing environment code
like they're pretty self-contained as
like they're pretty self-contained as
tests and uh they're pretty short as
tests and uh they're pretty short as
well
where's
where's
ocean so right here in Ocean in
Dev like let's see which is one of these
Dev like let's see which is one of these
that's pretty stable Hong is pretty
that's pretty stable Hong is pretty
stable so if you just look at this link
stable so if you just look at this link
here like the whole Logic for this thing
here like the whole Logic for this thing
is like 300 lines of c um it doesn't
is like 300 lines of c um it doesn't
have to be see like I said but it's just
have to be see like I said but it's just
a very simple procedural game where all
a very simple procedural game where all
the logic this is all the state for pong
the logic this is all the state for pong
and then at the bottom here you see that
and then at the bottom here you see that
the client is separate so you make the
the client is separate so you make the
client completely separately from the
client completely separately from the
game State meaning that you can run the
game State meaning that you can run the
game headless without having to render
game headless without having to render
and then we do our rendering in um we do
and then we do our rendering in um we do
our rendering typically in RB not
our rendering typically in RB not
required if you want to figure out how
required if you want to figure out how
to do like a 3js front end for a 3D
to do like a 3js front end for a 3D
thing that's totally fine the main
thing that's totally fine the main
important thing is that you have a fast
important thing is that you have a fast
uh fast State simulation
let me answer this guy real quick and
let me answer this guy real quick and
then we will uh we'll merge in The
then we will uh we'll merge in The
Connect Four stuff we'll fix that we'll
Connect Four stuff we'll fix that we'll
perf test it and so on
I'm question how exactly does
I'm question how exactly does
compatibility work between C and python
compatibility work between C and python
dumb questions are fine uh look so this
dumb questions are fine uh look so this
is it's not hard and puffer's done a lot
is it's not hard and puffer's done a lot
of the work for you there
of the work for you there
so this this is connect 4. Pi little
so this this is connect 4. Pi little
tiny file right this is the whole class
tiny file right this is the whole class
that you're seeing right here this is it
that you're seeing right here this is it
this is your python binding and you can
this is your python binding and you can
see that it adds this SC Connect 4 thing
see that it adds this SC Connect 4 thing
here and then SC Connect 4 you have a
here and then SC Connect 4 you have a
little piece of scon code that is the
little piece of scon code that is the
intermediate layer between Python and C
intermediate layer between Python and C
it also does this Loop over many
it also does this Loop over many
instances of the environment so it makes
instances of the environment so it makes
it very easy to efficiently run a whole
it very easy to efficiently run a whole
bunch of different instances of of the
bunch of different instances of of the
environment uh on one lowlevel process
environment uh on one lowlevel process
without having to go back to python
without having to go back to python
every time so this is all that's in here
every time so this is all that's in here
very simple class the thing that is at
very simple class the thing that is at
the top this is just header stuff
the top this is just header stuff
imported from
imported from
C and then after that literally you
C and then after that literally you
don't have to think about it because
don't have to think about it because
you're just writing you know lowl
you're just writing you know lowl
procedural code here for the actual
procedural code here for the actual
simulation
itself and this works with everything
itself and this works with everything
like this will work for multi-agent M
like this will work for multi-agent M
this works for all sorts of different
this works for all sorts of different
data types very very simple to add
data types very very simple to add
bindings uh this is one of the things I
bindings uh this is one of the things I
put a lot of effort into making clean
put a lot of effort into making clean
and simple with
and simple with
puffer is the way that we handle these
puffer is the way that we handle these
things we also we make it so that you
things we also we make it so that you
can build the environment as a
can build the environment as a
standalone Inc as well so that you can
standalone Inc as well so that you can
Dev stuff in pure C without having to go
Dev stuff in pure C without having to go
through the really obnoxiously long like
through the really obnoxiously long like
Python compile and build tools and all
Python compile and build tools and all
that that way you can just like focus on
that that way you can just like focus on
building a low-l procedural game or
building a low-l procedural game or
whatever and then The Binding thing is
whatever and then The Binding thing is
like on top of it in separate um and is
like on top of it in separate um and is
you know there not really very many
you know there not really very many
places for error anywhere along
that and again you don't need to have a
that and again you don't need to have a
ton of low-level Dev experience either
ton of low-level Dev experience either
like I wrote python for 10 years the
like I wrote python for 10 years the
low-l stuff is relatively new to me um
low-l stuff is relatively new to me um
it's just it's not that hard is simply
it's just it's not that hard is simply
the case like it's really not any harder
the case like it's really not any harder
than writing these M's in Python
okay so let's look at this Connect 4 n
okay so let's look at this Connect 4 n
um I thought I had a c perf test in one
um I thought I had a c perf test in one
of
of
these I think I can just grab it from
these I think I can just grab it from
the MOBA
maybe yeah we'll just grab this test
maybe yeah we'll just grab this test
per how do you run just the H you don't
per how do you run just the H you don't
run the H you run the
run the H you run the
C so you make a little C file like this
C so you make a little C file like this
is the one right here this little tiny
is the one right here this little tiny
piece of code for Connect 4 and then you
piece of code for Connect 4 and then you
run
run
this you include the H for scyon so the
this you include the H for scyon so the
scon and python layer doesn't need the C
scon and python layer doesn't need the C
file it just needs the H the C is like
file it just needs the H the C is like
the Standalone in C which we use for
the Standalone in C which we use for
both building the web demo and for
both building the web demo and for
testing
locally let's do like
locally let's do like
this I'm going to make a perf test on
this I'm going to make a perf test on
your Connect 4 real
quick equals
quick equals
R
R
percent 7
[Music]
okay so then we just do build
ocean
ocean
local what's wrong here include time. h
what's wrong with this
build is the do c is what's used on the
build is the do c is what's used on the
website build yes got to get back to
website build yes got to get back to
work we'll look into this tonight
work we'll look into this tonight
excited to find out more great yeah I'm
excited to find out more great yeah I'm
on Pacific Time and in the evenings I
on Pacific Time and in the evenings I
will often hang out on the the voice
will often hang out on the the voice
chat and Discord while I'm doing other
chat and Discord while I'm doing other
stuff so uh I help people out and get
stuff so uh I help people out and get
people on there as well is there a list
people on there as well is there a list
of things that need implementing yes
of things that need implementing yes
check the uh the Discord see what is uh
check the uh the Discord see what is uh
interesting there there's like a status
interesting there there's like a status
report I just posted in the Gen chat um
report I just posted in the Gen chat um
and if you know there's nothing there
and if you know there's nothing there
that's interesting to you like we will
that's interesting to you like we will
find lots of other things we want to
find lots of other things we want to
build out a big library of games and
build out a big library of games and
simulations and things of various types
simulations and things of various types
here that's the goal
Jake how did this thing compile for
you it looks like there is a missing
you it looks like there is a missing
include right
don't you need
um okay it works now with standard D
um okay it works now with standard D
that's
weird wonder why you need that header I
weird wonder why you need that header I
don't know
uh shift
uh shift
exponent something's weird
exponent something's weird
here let me see if this is my screw
up I don't see where I would have broken
up I don't see where I would have broken
it this thing runs for
you it's kind of suspicious that that uh
you it's kind of suspicious that that uh
that built for you at all actually did
that built for you at all actually did
you build it with the uh the like what
you build it with the uh the like what
script did you use to build it did you
script did you use to build it did you
use the build ocean
script let me link this guy the
stream uh where should I link him the
stream uh where should I link him the
YouTube stream
[Music]
all testing was via scyon python okay I
all testing was via scyon python okay I
see so that's probably
yeah so typically what you're going to
yeah so typically what you're going to
want to do is and in fact it should be
want to do is and in fact it should be
easier to do it this way is you do the
easier to do it this way is you do the
testing in C um that will get you a much
testing in C um that will get you a much
much faster build time as well and it
much faster build time as well and it
will also get you things like um the
will also get you things like um the
address sanitizer like C is very painful
address sanitizer like C is very painful
to write without an address sanitizer uh
to write without an address sanitizer uh
it's very very easy with the address
it's very very easy with the address
sanitizer right like here it looks like
sanitizer right like here it looks like
we've got buffer overflows somewhere
we've got buffer overflows somewhere
here oops let's not do
[Music]
that
375 that's interesting
I did try build ocean but it didn't work
I did try build ocean but it didn't work
on Mac
on Mac
yes I have not tried it on
Mac
124 too large for
bit hold on something's weird let me
bit hold on something's weird let me
figure out what's some there's some
figure out what's some there's some
noise outside one
noise outside one
[Music]
sec all right it was just construction I
sec all right it was just construction I
thought someone was breaking down my
thought someone was breaking down my
door I have a script for that it has
door I have a script for that it has
different spags Flags Great yeah Spencer
different spags Flags Great yeah Spencer
if you want to add that script to uh the
if you want to add that script to uh the
build ocean I don't know if you can just
build ocean I don't know if you can just
like add like a platform switch or
like add like a platform switch or
something that would be great this
something that would be great this
debugging looks great would have been
debugging looks great would have been
helpful yeah I don't like making people
helpful yeah I don't like making people
do painful work right like it should be
do painful work right like it should be
a lot easier should be U 64t for
a lot easier should be U 64t for
column okay
are is this thing just an alias for like
are is this thing just an alias for like
a unsigned long by the
way now this thing has an exponent of
way now this thing has an exponent of
1785 so something's weird there possibly
1785 so something's weird there possibly
hold on
hold on
I did I instantiate this thing with dumb
arguments wait
760 oh wait
maybe this might be my fault let me
see piece width piece
see piece width piece
height no you don't set anything else
here obs actions rewards DS and
locks
locks
OBS
OBS
stuns these all look
stuns these all look
fine these all look fine
yeah
yeah
ideally one thing I was confused about
ideally one thing I was confused about
when I tried to print F in theh file in
when I tried to print F in theh file in
new infra it like holds off the
new infra it like holds off the
print did you forget a sln
print did you forget a sln
Spencer did you forget like printa with
Spencer did you forget like printa with
a sln at the
a sln at the
end rows and columns should also not be
end rows and columns should also not be
int python build much more permissive I
int python build much more permissive I
don't know that's
don't know that's
weird um I'm surprised the python build
weird um I'm surprised the python build
works
works
then I mean I can compile without these
then I mean I can compile without these
flags and see what happens but I think
flags and see what happens but I think
it'll
break I had a fast mode maybe I didn't
break I had a fast mode maybe I didn't
commit
that here this is a fast mode for
that here this is a fast mode for
testing I needed to commit this
testing I needed to commit this
this will be useful for contributors as
this will be useful for contributors as
well uh you just get rid of the F
well uh you just get rid of the F
sanitized Flags mind you that means that
sanitized Flags mind you that means that
you are not checking for
you are not checking for
overflows and things like that okay this
overflows and things like that okay this
actually does work so this is what
actually does work so this is what
happens though this is what happens if
happens though this is what happens if
you uh you run it as is like it's
you uh you run it as is like it's
skipping all your moves and then this
skipping all your moves and then this
thing is
thing is
purple so yeah there's some bugs to fix
purple so yeah there's some bugs to fix
here um
Jake do you want me to commit this how
Jake do you want me to commit this how
about I commit you this perf test and um
about I commit you this perf test and um
do you want to see if you can fix it
do you want to see if you can fix it
from from here I'm also I'm happy to
from from here I'm also I'm happy to
debug this live if you get stuck on it
debug this live if you get stuck on it
but would you like to give uh give it a
but would you like to give uh give it a
shot
first fascinating yeah this is how you
first fascinating yeah this is how you
can test more
easily I want another go
gotcha there you go so there's your
gotcha there you go so there's your
there's your easier test harness for
there's your easier test harness for
that uh let me know if that doesn't work
that uh let me know if that doesn't work
Spencer can you paste the uh the flags
Spencer can you paste the uh the flags
for Jake
somewhere I don't have a Mac to like to
somewhere I don't have a Mac to like to
fix that
fix that
stuff oh cool ramy's doing stuff with
stuff oh cool ramy's doing stuff with
viz
Doom um if anybody has like questions
Doom um if anybody has like questions
and like or is looking for a specific en
and like or is looking for a specific en
to be put on um would be a good time to
to be put on um would be a good time to
do that cuz otherwise uh until there's
do that cuz otherwise uh until there's
more stuff to merge there's like a
more stuff to merge there's like a
rocket M that I could work on for a bit
rocket M that I could work on for a bit
uh there are a few other environments
uh there are a few other environments
that I might just start working on um
that I might just start working on um
but I'd be happy to get people
but I'd be happy to get people
onto stuff um the the key
things l
so the key thing here and I posted this

breakout I'm going to go push some small
breakout I'm going to go push some small
changes I'm going to go actually I
changes I'm going to go actually I
should grab my laptop and push that I
should grab my laptop and push that I
would like somebody to fix breakout it
would like somebody to fix breakout it
needs some small fixes and uh Noah is
needs some small fixes and uh Noah is
not going to have time to do it it's a
not going to have time to do it it's a
relatively small scope project for a new
relatively small scope project for a new
Dev it just needs like some cleanup and
Dev it just needs like some cleanup and
testing there's some stuff where like if
testing there's some stuff where like if
you hit the brick from the side the
you hit the brick from the side the
check doesn't even isn't done so it'll
check doesn't even isn't done so it'll
like clear all the bricks or something
like clear all the bricks or something
um robocode is like a slightly more
um robocode is like a slightly more
midsize project that kind of just needs
midsize project that kind of just needs
one somewhat more experienced Dev uh not
one somewhat more experienced Dev uh not
crazy hard or anything uh to do it's a
crazy hard or anything uh to do it's a
port of a tank battle thing that used to
port of a tank battle thing that used to
be used to teach people how to code in
be used to teach people how to code in
Java ported it I did an initial port to
Java ported it I did an initial port to
see and uh it just needs to be like
see and uh it just needs to be like
fully fleshed out and stuff but it's in
fully fleshed out and stuff but it's in
like a good starting spot uh triple
like a good starting spot uh triple
Triad needs a greedy opponent policy so
Triad needs a greedy opponent policy so
that we can have something decent to
that we can have something decent to
play against multi-agent snake could use
play against multi-agent snake could use
a similarly small refactor probably like
a similarly small refactor probably like
pong but maybe even a little bit
pong but maybe even a little bit
easier
easier
um let's see TCG is a bigger project so
um let's see TCG is a bigger project so
if somebody's interested in like taking
if somebody's interested in like taking
point on the start of a bigger project
point on the start of a bigger project
this one actually we have some academic
this one actually we have some academic
collabs on that are going to be starting
collabs on that are going to be starting
soon so this one would be really cool um
soon so this one would be really cool um
also if you have your own game M that
also if you have your own game M that
you're like hey I have this thing and
you're like hey I have this thing and
want to like bind it for Puffer that
want to like bind it for Puffer that
would be cool as
would be cool as
well unfortunately on a construction
well unfortunately on a construction
site and comp is dead so it won't be
site and comp is dead so it won't be
able to send script okay well no
able to send script okay well no
worries
worries
um Jake you might have to Google a
um Jake you might have to Google a
couple Flags
also the cluster the cluster policy for
also the cluster the cluster policy for
reference is uh once people start like
reference is uh once people start like
actually submitting substantial mdev and
actually submitting substantial mdev and
want to be running like experiments on
want to be running like experiments on
stuff that's when you get uh you get
stuff that's when you get uh you get
access to a cluster
access to a cluster
machine that's the collab policy on
that thinking need to familiarize myself
that thinking need to familiarize myself
with libraries and repos David here yeah
with libraries and repos David here yeah
um I tried to make it very simple
um I tried to make it very simple
Standalone stuff like if you if you want
Standalone stuff like if you if you want
to just get started adding an M or like
to just get started adding an M or like
fixing up an existing M basically all
fixing up an existing M basically all
the code you need for the simpler ones
the code you need for the simpler ones
is a few hundred lines in a file so this
is a few hundred lines in a file so this
is the like this is the pong M that we
have you can see here this is the RL
have you can see here this is the RL
agent playing pong versus this built-in
agent playing pong versus this built-in
opponent the pong M itself is 300 some
opponent the pong M itself is 300 some
odd lines a very simple procedural
odd lines a very simple procedural
python that is very similar to what you
python that is very similar to what you
would see if you were just writing this
would see if you were just writing this
normally as a game and not thinking
normally as a game and not thinking
about reinforcement learning at
about reinforcement learning at
all and then the actual RL agent in here
all and then the actual RL agent in here
is just grabbing uh this network from
is just grabbing uh this network from
puffer N.H which is is a uh 500 line
puffer N.H which is is a uh 500 line
Standalone neuronet inference library
Standalone neuronet inference library
that I wrote that matches pytorch but
that I wrote that matches pytorch but
this is it this is the whole code that
this is it this is the whole code that
runs on the web and we just compile this
runs on the web and we just compile this
to web assembly you can compile it
to web assembly you can compile it
locally as well for
locally as well for
testing and we provide tools for that
testing and we provide tools for that
puffer Li itself is a fair bit larger
puffer Li itself is a fair bit larger
but uh if you're just looking to get
but uh if you're just looking to get
started this is kind of a good spot and
started this is kind of a good spot and
then the idea is that like people write
then the idea is that like people write
M or people help polish up M and if they
M or people help polish up M and if they
want to get involved more in the
want to get involved more in the
experiment and RL side I provide input
experiment and RL side I provide input
on that and I can show you how to like
on that and I can show you how to like
start getting experiments running over
start getting experiments running over
these
M even the more complic ated projects
M even the more complic ated projects
that we have like this MOA this MOA is
that we have like this MOA this MOA is
still just one C file it's a 2,000 line
still just one C file it's a 2,000 line
C file instead of a 300 line C file but
C file instead of a 300 line C file but
it's very simple procedural code like
it's very simple procedural code like
you can read this thing top to bottom
you can read this thing top to bottom
and there won't be any
surprises is generally how I try to keep
surprises is generally how I try to keep
the work around
here oh
awesome for
cool lots of new potential contributors
cool lots of new potential contributors
that's
that's
awesome we're really going to get this
awesome we're really going to get this
project off the
ground that's
great I guess while I'm in between
great I guess while I'm in between
answering stuff here let me go get the
answering stuff here let me go get the
breakout en it's on my laptop at the
breakout en it's on my laptop at the
moment uh I'm going to take 2 minutes
moment uh I'm going to take 2 minutes
put another put the kettle on for more
put another put the kettle on for more
coffee or tea or whatever uh I'm going
coffee or tea or whatever uh I'm going
to grab my laptop so I can sync up the
to grab my laptop so I can sync up the
breakout code cuz I want somebody to be
breakout code cuz I want somebody to be
able to clean that up and then I'll
able to clean that up and then I'll
probably do that and then start on some
probably do that and then start on some
more stuff with the rocket M uh in like
more stuff with the rocket M uh in like
a couple hours once I finish all that be
a couple hours once I finish all that be
right
back
e
e e
okay so I uh I woke up early this
okay so I uh I woke up early this
morning and immediately started
morning and immediately started
refactoring the breakout code on my
refactoring the breakout code on my
laptop um I'm going
laptop um I'm going
to commit this up real quick and then
to commit this up real quick and then
I'm going to start working on it on here
I'm going to start working on it on here
uh I'm not going to fully finish it cuz
uh I'm not going to fully finish it cuz
hopefully one of you will take over that
hopefully one of you will take over that
refactor it's a pretty easy job for a
refactor it's a pretty easy job for a
new
new
contributor
contributor
um
yeah hold
yeah hold
on let me Commit This real
quick
out one minute here out. c breakout. h
break out
minior get push origin
minior get push origin
Dev get
P
P
push
push
yes
okay
so this is now a very nice little
so this is now a very nice little
Standalone thing for somebody to
do I'll show you the uh the state of
this okay so here's our breakout en it
this okay so here's our breakout en it
actually has a train policy already
actually has a train policy already
playing it you can see here you can hold
playing it you can see here you can hold
shift to take over for the
shift to take over for the
agent it's like up to fire the ball and
agent it's like up to fire the ball and
then left and right um but like this en
then left and right um but like this en
is very glitchy and there are just some
is very glitchy and there are just some
things that need to be better with the
things that need to be better with the
code like the Collision checks right now
code like the Collision checks right now
it you can like hit the uh the bricks
it you can like hit the uh the bricks
from the side and it'll like go through
from the side and it'll like go through
a whole bunch of them basically it just
a whole bunch of them basically it just
needs to be like polished up and made
needs to be like polished up and made
into a slightly less exploitable game uh
into a slightly less exploitable game uh
it is a lot easier than the original
it is a lot easier than the original
Atari Breakout as well I think that
Atari Breakout as well I think that
that's kind of okay because the original
that's kind of okay because the original
Atari Breakout game is really
Atari Breakout game is really
like it'll just randomly slam the ball
like it'll just randomly slam the ball
back at you very fast okay yeah just
back at you very fast okay yeah just
there you saw the puffer just kind of
there you saw the puffer just kind of
like ate a bunch of blocks cuz the
like ate a bunch of blocks cuz the
Collision checks are bad so just a few
Collision checks are bad so just a few
small things like that um it doesn't
small things like that um it doesn't
show you the second screen of bricks in
show you the second screen of bricks in
the original Atari game there are two
the original Atari game there are two
screens of bricks so you get two levels
screens of bricks so you get two levels
to clear it doesn't do that correctly um
to clear it doesn't do that correctly um
and I don't think it resets cleanly when
and I don't think it resets cleanly when
you beat all the bricks as well that
you beat all the bricks as well that
plus minor code refactors so if anybody
plus minor code refactors so if anybody
wants to just take this on that would be
wants to just take this on that would be
awesome
awesome
um
yeah
for
[Music]
for
for e
there we go that's a pretty good
response looks good to me could start
response looks good to me could start
working on breakout or Robo code awesome
working on breakout or Robo code awesome
yeah depends on your uh your level of
yeah depends on your uh your level of
experience oh I missed your thing slime
experience oh I missed your thing slime
volley hadn't thought of that game in
volley hadn't thought of that game in
two decades yeah we would also be very
two decades yeah we would also be very
happy to have that as an EnV but it uses
happy to have that as an EnV but it uses
like really janky old physics um it
like really janky old physics um it
would have to be either probably the
would have to be either probably the
easiest thing would just to be to have
easiest thing would just to be to have
it do its own custom physics as like a
it do its own custom physics as like a
single file CNF um with rayb for render
single file CNF um with rayb for render
uh we'd be very happy to have that one
uh we'd be very happy to have that one
if you want to do a new project we have
if you want to do a new project we have
plenty of projects at the moment that
plenty of projects at the moment that
need to be finished if you want to take
need to be finished if you want to take
the breakout one that would actually
the breakout one that would actually
just be awesome the robo code one is a
just be awesome the robo code one is a
slightly larger project so depends on
slightly larger project so depends on
your level of experience hold
on okay yeah you're very qualified for
on okay yeah you're very qualified for
this types of this type of stuff then so
this types of this type of stuff then so
yeah either basically if you want
yeah either basically if you want
something small to start with that's
something small to start with that's
just like a pretty simple little
just like a pretty simple little
refactor and like fix some weird buggy
refactor and like fix some weird buggy
Collision stuff you can do the breakout
Collision stuff you can do the breakout
it probably won't take you more than a
it probably won't take you more than a
few hours and then uh the robocode one
few hours and then uh the robocode one
is going to be like a probably few Day
is going to be like a probably few Day
project um for someone with decent
project um for someone with decent
systems
background this is so great to have
background this is so great to have
people doing this stuff break out to get
people doing this stuff break out to get
the gears turning yeah I figure that
the gears turning yeah I figure that
that's like a nice little contribution
that's like a nice little contribution
and basically the way it works around
and basically the way it works around
here is whenever people finish stuff I
here is whenever people finish stuff I
will either review it on stream or in a
will either review it on stream or in a
voice call in Discord either way as soon
voice call in Discord either way as soon
as people are done with stuff in our
as people are done with stuff in our
Frey glad I found your post so am I we
Frey glad I found your post so am I we
could really use the contribution help
could really use the contribution help
like I kind of just got sick of stuff
like I kind of just got sick of stuff
this morning and just started tweeting
this morning and just started tweeting
cuz it's like okay look this update has
cuz it's like okay look this update has
just dragged on for too long because
just dragged on for too long because
there is only so much code that I can
there is only so much code that I can
write you know like I have to do the
write you know like I have to do the
core of puffer mostly myself I'm also
core of puffer mostly myself I'm also
like trying to juggle all these
like trying to juggle all these
different environments and it's just
different environments and it's just
it's too much to do all of um and it's
it's too much to do all of um and it's
an a Very scalable open- Source problem
an a Very scalable open- Source problem
right like these M's are basically
right like these M's are basically
completely independent they're pretty
completely independent they're pretty
small and isolated they only take like a
small and isolated they only take like a
developer per EnV to do
properly and I figured it's a good way
properly and I figured it's a good way
for people to get into the space as well
for people to get into the space as well
like I don't know Spencer joined a few
like I don't know Spencer joined a few
weeks ago and he already made he did the
weeks ago and he already made he did the
Prototype well he did Connect 4 before
Prototype well he did Connect 4 before
the rewrite that Jack just did he did
the rewrite that Jack just did he did
the Triad en and he's working on go now
the Triad en and he's working on go now
already running experiments and stuff so
already running experiments and stuff so
it's pretty easy to spin people up on
it's pretty easy to spin people up on
the RL side once they're doing
the RL side once they're doing
this yeah it's the best kind of parallel
this yeah it's the best kind of parallel
embarrassingly parallel for the most
embarrassingly parallel for the most
part occasionally I have to go in and
part occasionally I have to go in and
mess with like the uh the harnesses like
mess with like the uh the harnesses like
the bindings for these
the bindings for these
M and I still have to do that manually
M and I still have to do that manually
we're trying to cut down on boiler plate
we're trying to cut down on boiler plate
and cut down on boiler plate there's
and cut down on boiler plate there's
like a third of the boiler plate that
like a third of the boiler plate that
there used to be um there's still a few
there used to be um there's still a few
things I think we could cut down a
things I think we could cut down a
little bit on the scyon but I have to
little bit on the scyon but I have to
figure that out still oh did you say
figure that out still oh did you say
wait
wait
Cuda I didn't see if you had physics
Cuda I didn't see if you had physics
background because we do want to be
background because we do want to be
doing more physics stuff at some
doing more physics stuff at some
point lce yeah this
point lce yeah this
is that's some crazy
is that's some crazy
stuff heavy on computation Cuda M C++
okay well if you want to do physics
okay well if you want to do physics
stuff um hold
on we've got uh I started working on
on we've got uh I started working on
this earlier this week and I think
this earlier this week and I think
there's a UT Austin PhD student who's
there's a UT Austin PhD student who's
also interested in helping with
this does this
run hold on let me add box 2D
where's bux 2D
gone
gone
uh hold on let me show you this
demo is it just like d
demo is it just like d
i
box did I only bind it to setup.py
where did my thing
where did my thing
go that's bizarre
let me get this thing to build real
let me get this thing to build real
quick because we've got like this rocket
quick because we've got like this rocket
Lander en that I
Lander en that I
started un
started un
2dh where did this thing go hold
2dh where did this thing go hold
on I could have sworn that
on I could have sworn that
I I pushed like um bucks to D build
I I pushed like um bucks to D build
flags
that's so
weird let me find that so I I can show
weird let me find that so I I can show
in the meantime though the thing that I
in the meantime though the thing that I
uh we were building off of um it in
uh we were building off of um it in
honor of of SpaceX Landing uh the crazy
honor of of SpaceX Landing uh the crazy
rocket I found there's this rocket en
rocket I found there's this rocket en
Landing en here that uh uses really old
Landing en here that uh uses really old
janky python bindings for box 2D and I
janky python bindings for box 2D and I
ported it to C and I got it to be very
ported it to C and I got it to be very
fast like a basic version of it this is
fast like a basic version of it this is
what it looked like in a python Port the
what it looked like in a python Port the
python Port was too slow but um
python Port was too slow but um
basically I've been working on this side
basically I've been working on this side
and I've been having a ton of trouble
and I've been having a ton of trouble
figuring out the phys PHS uh the physics
figuring out the phys PHS uh the physics
side of this and the physics API with
side of this and the physics API with
box 2D and stuff um generally we do want
box 2D and stuff um generally we do want
to have much better support for physics
to have much better support for physics
types M's and yeah I just we generally
types M's and yeah I just we generally
would like to have somebody who knows
would like to have somebody who knows
that space and uh knows how to make that
that space and uh knows how to make that
stuff be
fast so if you're interested in that
fast so if you're interested in that
side that's another thing we could
explore not sure if that's what you're
explore not sure if that's what you're
trying to get into or if that's what
trying to get into or if that's what
you're trying to get away from either
you're trying to get away from either
way we're happy to have
contributions let me find this like
just need
just need
the source file shouldn't
I I have this let me go find where this
I I have this let me go find where this
thing was so I can build the rocket M
thing was so I can build the rocket M
and start working on that on the side
and start working on that on the side
today I think that PhD student's going
today I think that PhD student's going
to want to play with this m tomorrow and
to want to play with this m tomorrow and
it doesn't train
yet oh do I have to link it
oh do I just need Dash L box 2D
still
no hang on we'll have a cool rocket
no hang on we'll have a cool rocket
Lander and in a
Lander and in a
second I forgot the include
second I forgot the include
right yeah I I did this wrong so this is
right yeah I I did this wrong so this is
duh you have to link this- I include
duh you have to link this- I include
there we
there we
[Music]
[Music]
go okay so here's our very very basic
go okay so here's our very very basic
version of this rocket Lander en you can
version of this rocket Lander en you can
mess with the rocket in all sorts of
ways physics is kind of
ways physics is kind of
janky 2D physics engines have a bunch of
janky 2D physics engines have a bunch of
particular problems which honestly game
particular problems which honestly game
devs are more suited to than physicists
devs are more suited to than physicists
but I have a full tool belt of things to
but I have a full tool belt of things to
try that's cool I mean we're not really
try that's cool I mean we're not really
linked to um weird physics engines
linked to um weird physics engines
either like I just was using this cuz
either like I just was using this cuz
this was here I mean if you're going to
this was here I mean if you're going to
tell me that like hey this physics
tell me that like hey this physics
engine ends up being like 10 lines of
engine ends up being like 10 lines of
math and we can just Implement like a
math and we can just Implement like a
100 lines of code that's going to be
100 lines of code that's going to be
good enough for a lot of the physics
good enough for a lot of the physics
stuff that we are going to want to do
stuff that we are going to want to do
I'm very happy with that as well just
I'm very happy with that as well just
trying to get more open source
trying to get more open source
contributions under my belt and this
contributions under my belt and this
seems like a fun project yeah absolutely
seems like a fun project yeah absolutely
and this is a very good way to get into
and this is a very good way to get into
um Ai and RL space as well if that's
um Ai and RL space as well if that's
something that you're
something that you're
interested in um because with puffer
interested in um because with puffer
it's actually pretty darn easy to get
it's actually pretty darn easy to get
these things to train now with how fast
these things to train now with how fast
it goes single body single platform yeah
it goes single body single platform yeah
10 Lin sounds right single body single
10 Lin sounds right single body single
platform okay I
see the original end was a little bit
see the original end was a little bit
more than that they had
more than that they had
um where is it the original en had like
um where is it the original en had like
a little bit more stuff because
a little bit more stuff because
let me show you the
let me show you the
rocket I actually kind of think it's
rocket I actually kind of think it's
funny to have a rocket Landing end
funny to have a rocket Landing end
because it's like AI isn't rocket
because it's like AI isn't rocket
science until it
science until it
is but um I mean it's obviously way
is but um I mean it's obviously way
simplified so here they have like this
simplified so here they have like this
landing gear thing as well on it and you
landing gear thing as well on it and you
can apply a force from the bottom and
can apply a force from the bottom and
you can also apply force from the top at
you can also apply force from the top at
either side with these like
thrusters so that's what we're doing
here the Falcon 9 is like seven years
here the Falcon 9 is like seven years
old okay bet if you want mechazilla
old okay bet if you want mechazilla
Chopstick arms for landing rocket M pull
Chopstick arms for landing rocket M pull
up and code it
Elon wants
Elon wants
them I mean it kind of worked the guy
them I mean it kind of worked the guy
wasn't wrong
wasn't wrong
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
right crazy that it worked but it did
work he is usually right it
seems I mean he like like there wouldn't
seems I mean he like like there wouldn't
be any he wouldn't get any respect for
be any he wouldn't get any respect for
the crazy things he does uh unless he
the crazy things he does uh unless he
ended up being right most of the time
ended up being right most of the time
right that's the that's the hard part
right that's the that's the hard part
you actually have to be
you actually have to be
right otherwise you're just a
manager okay I don't know why I feel
manager okay I don't know why I feel
like torturing myself with this rocket
like torturing myself with this rocket
Lander end right now but probably want
Lander end right now but probably want
to do a little bit on it going to try to
to do a little bit on it going to try to
fix breakout and let you know when I
fix breakout and let you know when I
have a PR up awesome I will be streaming
have a PR up awesome I will be streaming
for the next probably 4 4 and a half
for the next probably 4 4 and a half
hours on this and then after that I'll
hours on this and then after that I'll
be uh probably in the Discord for like
be uh probably in the Discord for like
an hour or so after
an hour or so after
that that's the usual schedule
okay is this the updated version of the
N I don't know if this is the updated
N I don't know if this is the updated
version of the N this uh this does not
version of the N this uh this does not
feel like it controls correctly I just
feel like it controls correctly I just
tap the key once and it starts spinning
tap the key once and it starts spinning
out of
control yeah I could have sworn that I
control yeah I could have sworn that I
like I had fixed this portion here where
like I had fixed this portion here where
like the the actions weren't synced up
like the the actions weren't synced up
um that's kind of
um that's kind of
weird that's no big
weird that's no big
deal at least do we have the RL harness
deal at least do we have the RL harness
for this yet in this
version looks like we do
so now you just tap it and you can tap
so now you just tap it and you can tap
it back like
this looks good office
this looks good office
hours bet is our resident Advertiser but
hours bet is our resident Advertiser but
uh we do appreciate
uh we do appreciate
stars on the
stars on the
repository it uh it actually really
repository it uh it actually really
really helps to have stars on this thing
really helps to have stars on this thing
because it means that more people see
because it means that more people see
the project and we get more
the project and we get more
contributions and we get more bug
contributions and we get more bug
reports and things like that so feed the
reports and things like that so feed the
puffer
star can I run train on this now
what's the current
reward there's an out of bounds
reward there's an out of bounds
penalty
um hold on blender in the
background e
[Music]
[Music]
Blended Seven Ways to
Sunday okay
so how is there no rocket
Lander oh I think it's cuz I just
Lander oh I think it's cuz I just
commented Out Hold
commented Out Hold
On The One obnoxious thing about this
On The One obnoxious thing about this
rocket EnV is like um because it
rocket EnV is like um because it
includes box 2D it kind of complicates
includes box 2D it kind of complicates
the puffer setup a little bit so we're
the puffer setup a little bit so we're
going to have to figure out something to
going to have to figure out something to
do with that but for now we'll just mess
do with that but for now we'll just mess
mess with it
locally okay so here we have a random
locally okay so here we have a random
policy is controlling this
thing let's figure out with the reward
thing let's figure out with the reward
function of this
thing I did a whole bunch of stuff with
thing I did a whole bunch of stuff with
this reward that I don't actually
this reward that I don't actually
know if is a good
idea what if I just ignore this for
now and
then also I'm happy to get people
then also I'm happy to get people
onboarded with stuff and like working on
onboarded with stuff and like working on
things um while I'm doing this I'm kind
things um while I'm doing this I'm kind
of just working on this m in the
of just working on this m in the
background in the meantime of stuff you
background in the meantime of stuff you
know oh this is awful these parameters
know oh this is awful these parameters
are just
are just
awful uh
awful uh
huh yeah this is very
weird we'll run this once just to see
[Music]
[Music]
my head is covering
this okay so we should get a WP chart
this okay so we should get a WP chart
for
this
oops and we'll see how this
does
sweeps okay so here's
sweeps okay so here's
our rocket Lander en and it can't
our rocket Lander en and it can't
doesn't really learn to do anything
doesn't really learn to do anything
initially so I think that there's just
initially so I think that there's just
something wrong this is a very new
something wrong this is a very new
project and um like I've messed some
project and um like I've messed some
things up with
things up with
it it's going back
um it is starting to optimize
interestingly we'll see whether it
interestingly we'll see whether it
actually gets any better than this but I
actually gets any better than this but I
will be interested to see what this
will be interested to see what this
policy
policy
does Discord
Jake will probably have a Connect 4 PR
Jake will probably have a Connect 4 PR
at some
point Spencer's got Go stuff going
on BET do you have uh do you have Enduro
on BET do you have uh do you have Enduro
code for me to look at at some point
code for me to look at at some point
today or are you good on dev at the
today or are you good on dev at the
moment seg
fault all right we had some work to do
fault all right we had some work to do
there
then uh was it getting
worse Enduro is basically logically
worse Enduro is basically logically
there okay awesome
goal is to get more M's onto website
goal is to get more M's onto website
soon oh let me actually make a
post for
cool nice little Enduro version nice
cool nice little Enduro version nice
need to make it pretty as well yeah it
need to make it pretty as well yeah it
is somewhat important
is somewhat important
not unimportant at
not unimportant at
least um okay so our new experiment here
least um okay so our new experiment here
this is
crashing rewards crashing
crashing rewards crashing
here the goal with this is to just have
here the goal with this is to just have
like some sort of rocket that does that
like some sort of rocket that does that
does a
thing so I can hopefully get a build out
thing so I can hopefully get a build out
that PhD student wanted to use it for a
that PhD student wanted to use it for a
demo at some point pretty soon
model

o
39 maybe this is okay
wouldn't mind helping with RL
wouldn't mind helping with RL
integration not main ISS codes there
integration not main ISS codes there
there are some C things not quite lining
there are some C things not quite lining
up like what are you compiling with the
up like what are you compiling with the
uh this F address sanitized Flags cuz
uh this F address sanitized Flags cuz
that should help a lot
yes it seems
yes it seems
fine like what is the actual problem
fine like what is the actual problem
that you're dealing
with that's a weird model
couldn't diagnose with GDB either it's
couldn't diagnose with GDB either it's
very
weird I have to install torch yeah no
weird I have to install torch yeah no
problem
very weird how
very weird how
this so what I can't figure out here is
this so what I can't figure out here is
that technically it should just be able
that technically it should just be able
to learn to not do anything and that
to learn to not do anything and that
actually should give it decent reward
actually should give it decent reward
um I would like to at least have a
um I would like to at least have a
rocket that can like land itself with
rocket that can like land itself with
some perturbations before we go crazy on
some perturbations before we go crazy on
the physics
the physics
side just to like a
side just to like a
decent decent little environment you
decent decent little environment you
know
know
um let me see I got to go print
um let me see I got to go print
out I'll print out
out I'll print out
the reward obtained
here let's just do
okay so now you can see the reward
okay so now you can see the reward
function
here I wonder if this is like that old
here I wonder if this is like that old
continuous reward
problem I bet you this is just a
problem I bet you this is just a
continuous rewards being dumb problem to
continuous rewards being dumb problem to
be
be
honest what information does it have it
honest what information does it have it
has the same information pretty much
has the same information pretty much
from the original it knows its position
from the original it knows its position
it's like its
it's like its
velocities um torque stuff like that I
think final link
failed
value do you want to just PR the N bet
value do you want to just PR the N bet
because that just looks like bad setup
because that just looks like bad setup
stuff
I don't mind having like half done M's
I don't mind having like half done M's
in the dev Branch it is a Dev Branch
in the dev Branch it is a Dev Branch
after
after
all oh that's you trying to install
all oh that's you trying to install
torch never
torch never
mind yeah okay you can fix your own
mind yeah okay you can fix your own
torch
errors yeah you can fix your own torch
errors yeah you can fix your own torch
errors let me fix this reward function
errors let me fix this reward function

um
yeah so there are a
yeah so there are a
few Pokemon is hard but it's slow MOA
few Pokemon is hard but it's slow MOA
MOA is probably pretty hard that's like
MOA is probably pretty hard that's like
a very complex environment um when we
a very complex environment um when we
finish the TCG the TCG will probably be
finish the TCG the TCG will probably be
medium or hard um the secret M that I
medium or hard um the secret M that I
have is probably also going to be medium
have is probably also going to be medium
or hard uh probably hard Robo code will
or hard uh probably hard Robo code will
probably be
probably be
mediumish um yeah the goal is to have
mediumish um yeah the goal is to have
like a spectrum of M's right so like
like a spectrum of M's right so like
easy would be pong and
easy would be pong and
breakout um maybe try it I don't know
breakout um maybe try it I don't know
how hard try it is to be honest it might
how hard try it is to be honest it might
be hard Connect 4 might actually be
be hard Connect 4 might actually be
decently challenging once we have a good
decently challenging once we have a good
opponent policy snake is probably pretty
opponent policy snake is probably pretty
easy
easy
um MOA is definitely harder
um MOA is definitely harder
right uh go is going to be harder go is
right uh go is going to be harder go is
very configurable it can be easy medium
very configurable it can be easy medium
or hard depending on board size you know
or hard depending on board size you know
there should be like a decent range of
there should be like a decent range of
different
different
complexities um things we're lacking on
complexities um things we're lacking on
at the moment we're definitely lacking
at the moment we're definitely lacking
like enough continuous control style Ms
like enough continuous control style Ms
we definitely need more like continuous
we definitely need more like continuous
M um and yeah
M um and yeah
probably that's going to be the main
probably that's going to be the main
thing the problem with the the harder Ms
thing the problem with the the harder Ms
is like you need to find stuff that's
is like you need to find stuff that's
not going to take two months to
not going to take two months to
implement just one M right like the Moa
implement just one M right like the Moa
actually took like two months to do all
actually took like two months to do all
the stuff that was in
the stuff that was in
it and it's like it's a pretty decent
it and it's like it's a pretty decent
mob it has a couple render bugs um but
mob it has a couple render bugs um but
it's not like even a full a fullon mob
it's not like even a full a fullon mob
or anything right like you could spend a
or anything right like you could spend a
lot of time improving stuff like the
lot of time improving stuff like the
Autos are actually automatic there's not
Autos are actually automatic there's not
a way to do like a laning phase where
a way to do like a laning phase where
you have to go back and forth with Autos
you have to go back and forth with Autos
it's kind of just like um you know team
it's kind of just like um you know team
battle simulator down mid at the moment
battle simulator down mid at the moment
though probably there is potential to
though probably there is potential to
learn like s side laning
stuff yeah
it's previous X and Y
I'm trying to think how I want to do
this I guess we'll just have to
this I guess we'll just have to
do we'll just paste it for
do we'll just paste it for
now X
why I want to change the way that the
why I want to change the way that the
rewards are structured this is I can't
rewards are structured this is I can't
believe that I made this error
believe that I made this error
again with the way that I made a
again with the way that I made a
continuous
continuous
rewards kind of a noob
rewards kind of a noob
error I'm pretty sure that as soon as I
error I'm pretty sure that as soon as I
fix this it'll
work this is actually going to be an
work this is actually going to be an
instructive thing for people interested
instructive thing for people interested
in the RL side though so we have
in the RL side though so we have
rev
rev
X rev y so the the key here is that um
X rev y so the the key here is that um
if you give a continuous reward that's
if you give a continuous reward that's
just like the position or like the
just like the position or like the
distance from something it's actually
distance from something it's actually
kind of hard to learn because if you
kind of hard to learn because if you
take a small step the reward only
take a small step the reward only
changes a little tiny bit whereas if you
changes a little tiny bit whereas if you
say you get a reward for going in the
say you get a reward for going in the
right direction and a negative reward
right direction and a negative reward
for going in the wrong direction that is
for going in the wrong direction that is
much much easier to
much much easier to
learn so what we'll simply do
what's the
uh let me
think so reward X is going to
be going to be
be going to be
previous hold on
xus is this correct let's
see you
want yeah it's cuz you want to go you
want yeah it's cuz you want to go you
want to get closer to the center
want to get closer to the center
okay and
okay and
then this next
then this next
one uh you want to get closer to the
one uh you want to get closer to the
bottom right so you want to
do the same thing with Y to be
honest and then do we divide by I don't
honest and then do we divide by I don't
think we have to should divide by as
think we have to should divide by as
much
much
anymore um this is probably only divide
anymore um this is probably only divide
by like a
by like a
thousand let's see if this does anything
different reward
y redefinition of transform
okay
so this reward
so this reward
Y is not good I don't know why it's not
Y is not good I don't know why it's not
giving Us rewards
oh because this has to go duh this has
oh because this has to go duh this has
to go up
here yeah yeah yeah this has to go all
here yeah yeah yeah this has to go all
the way up
here try this
all right
all right
now now you can see we're actually
now now you can see we're actually
getting positive rewards
getting positive rewards
right in positive rewards and now we get
right in positive rewards and now we get
Negative rewards for going up
hey how's it
going I think that the Thruster is done
going I think that the Thruster is done
incorrectly it should still be able to
incorrectly it should still be able to
optimize for this
though let's see if uh let's see if this
though let's see if uh let's see if this
will actually learn anything now
oh this reward is still just
tiny there we
tiny there we
go that's that's got some teeth to it
go that's that's got some teeth to it
we're going to run a new
we're going to run a new
experiment and then uh we will see
whether I have figured anything out with
this check Discord in the
meantime tried visdom oblig
uh I don't see anything that should mess
uh I don't see anything that should mess
it up
oh
is this
learning let's see if we get WB curves
learning let's see if we get WB curves
for uh this
rocket and folks I'm just kind of
rocket and folks I'm just kind of
chilling and deving on this in the
chilling and deving on this in the
meantime um if anybody has questions on
meantime um if anybody has questions on
like projects to get started on or
like projects to get started on or
whatnot very happy to get people uh get
whatnot very happy to get people uh get
people going on
people going on
puffer okay so this is just unstable
puffer okay so this is just unstable
right probably crappy hyper
parameters yeah these are insane
[Music]
uh oh
uh oh
oh is probably
oh is probably
[Music]
[Music]
good just going to set some things that
good just going to set some things that
I know to be like generally
I know to be like generally
reasonable hyper
reasonable hyper
parameters we'll see what this gets
us there's kind of this little Quirk
us there's kind of this little Quirk
with the way that carbs does hyper
with the way that carbs does hyper
parameter sweeps where it'll find like
parameter sweeps where it'll find like
these really decent learning curves that
these really decent learning curves that
are very
are very
unstable we're kind of looking into
that oh this is
that oh this is
weird this rapidly gets even worse
are we still
are we still
unstable we're still very
unstable this
K that's very
weird did I mess something up oh yeah I
weird did I mess something up oh yeah I
messed up totally the mini batch size is
messed up totally the mini batch size is
horrible
let's try
again there we
again there we
go when you're looking at WB curves and
go when you're looking at WB curves and
watching episode returns you assuming it
watching episode returns you assuming it
should be immediately getting better not
should be immediately getting better not
necessarily it's just taking a little
necessarily it's just taking a little
longer to figure out a tough State
longer to figure out a tough State
action space so I'm looking at here is
action space so I'm looking at here is
these curves exploding these loss curves
these curves exploding these loss curves
exploding this is a diverging policy um
exploding this is a diverging policy um
it's not like flat or anything it's
diverging um and I have I know that the
diverging um and I have I know that the
specific combination of hyper parameters
specific combination of hyper parameters
there is likely to cause that because I
there is likely to cause that because I
had the mini batch set very very small
had the mini batch set very very small
relative to the batch size meaning that
relative to the batch size meaning that
it's doing a ton of small updates on
it's doing a ton of small updates on
stale data which can often be unstable
stale data which can often be unstable
so I just switched that out and now I'm
so I just switched that out and now I'm
going to see whether it's more stable or
going to see whether it's more stable or
other stuff is wrong here now a lot of
other stuff is wrong here now a lot of
this work you shouldn't often have have
this work you shouldn't often have have
to be doing manually but because this is
to be doing manually but because this is
a new environment and I don't know for
a new environment and I don't know for
sure whether it is the environment
sure whether it is the environment
that's broken or the uh the training
that's broken or the uh the training
here like the prams I'm doing a little
here like the prams I'm doing a little
bit of it manually to get a sense for
bit of it manually to get a sense for
things like it is suspicious that this
things like it is suspicious that this
is still not looking particularly stable
is still not looking particularly stable
here I give it a little bit longer it
here I give it a little bit longer it
looks
looks
like n it's not really learning
like n it's not really learning
anything this is a very simple problem
anything this is a very simple problem
with a very nice reward so it should
with a very nice reward so it should
basically learn instantly is the
thing
thing
yeah they do something weird
n batch size is
n batch size is
one shouldn't this be
four oh no it should be uh it should be
four oh no it should be uh it should be
two shouldn't
two shouldn't
it yeah we
it yeah we
want probably this
okay so now the next question is going
okay so now the next question is going
to be why is this not
to be why is this not
stable learning does not appear to be
stable learning does not appear to be
particularly stable
you literally you get positive reward if
you literally you get positive reward if
you just don't press
anything you get negative reward if you
anything you get negative reward if you
press
up don't
up don't
you all right let's uh let's make it a
you all right let's uh let's make it a
little let's make it a little simpler
right make it a little simpler
I think this is
up what if we do
up what if we do
this it literally has a button to press
this it literally has a button to press
and has to learn to not press
it I'm giving it a I'm giving it like a
it I'm giving it a I'm giving it like a
very trivial task because basically if
very trivial task because basically if
this doesn't work it's very likely
this doesn't work it's very likely
something is like screwed up with the
something is like screwed up with the
data
somehow yeah so this is like this is
somehow yeah so this is like this is
bizarre um this curve this is like
bizarre um this curve this is like
something fundamentally
screwy RL is actually pretty sane once
screwy RL is actually pretty sane once
um you get stuff set up
um you get stuff set up
correctly so
yeah no this is no
good okay we have a few things to check
good okay we have a few things to check
here um so the first thing
is going to be to run
eval eval a random
eval eval a random
policy see what it
policy see what it
[Music]
does and it presses up too much I guess
does and it presses up too much I guess
right and then if I do it again with
right and then if I do it again with
this being off
it casually floats back down to earth
it casually floats back down to earth
and gets good reward
and gets good reward
right yeah start going up oh wait why is
right yeah start going up oh wait why is
it
negative did I forget to
rebuild that's
Jank you see the reward being negative
Jank you see the reward being negative
here this uh this does not make sense it
here this uh this does not make sense it
should be getting positive reward right
now ooh do I not have the
now ooh do I not have the
file I guess I have not been rebuilding
file I guess I have not been rebuilding
the environment with the the python
the environment with the the python
version that would do it
to figure out how to do uh the Box 2D
to figure out how to do uh the Box 2D
include now aren't
I box
I box
2D runtime Library do
should be
include okay did that
include okay did that
work looks like
work looks like
it now if I run eval do we get positive
it now if I run eval do we get positive
reward yes we do get positive
reward yes we do get positive
reward so now hopefully we can actually
reward so now hopefully we can actually
train it
right just double check one other thing
right just double check one other thing
just make sure that this number here
just make sure that this number here
prints out is positive
oh no because it's it's a random policy
oh no because it's it's a random policy
that's fine
though okay so we'll let this
train and hopefully this should decrease
train and hopefully this should decrease
yep look at
yep look at
that new reward curve
it literally was for once it was a
it literally was for once it was a
fundamental RL
fundamental RL
thing it was a fundamental screw up with
thing it was a fundamental screw up with
the
the
uh with the way that we were specifying
uh with the way that we were specifying
rewards
rewards
cool we'll wait for this to Output a a
cool we'll wait for this to Output a a
checkpoint of some
sort an error
action
space SP
spaces using continuous space
no we definitely support continuous
no we definitely support continuous
bases
h
I see
is this
is this
collapsing no it's just it's idling okay
collapsing no it's just it's idling okay
this is good
it's
this is going to be the world's most
this is going to be the world's most
boring policy to start
with checkpoint saved it update 100
right so what we're going to do is we're
right so what we're going to do is we're
going to watch the policy back and it
going to watch the policy back and it
shouldn't be doing anything so actually
shouldn't be doing anything so actually
ironically if it's not doing
ironically if it's not doing
anything uh then it is actually learned
anything uh then it is actually learned
correctly
correctly
because it literally just needs to drift
because it literally just needs to drift
down to earth to start
with huh ironically it seems to have
with huh ironically it seems to have
found that it's able to just
spin
spin
also reward can be
also reward can be
Amplified the more close it is like
interpolation also reward can be
interpolation also reward can be
Amplified there are many ways to set
Amplified there are many ways to set
stuff up
stuff up
um I don't think that there's any reason
um I don't think that there's any reason
to have to do that like you don't need
to have to do that like you don't need
to you should not need to increase the
to you should not need to increase the
reward the closer it gets it just needs
reward the closer it gets it just needs
to have a reward for getting closer the
to have a reward for getting closer the
thing that I did before that didn't work
thing that I did before that didn't work
at all this actually works substantially
at all this actually works substantially
better by comparison though kind of
better by comparison though kind of
confused why it doesn't um
me
see do I have my rewards backwards or
something I think I got my rewards
something I think I got my rewards
backwards seeing stuff from 20 minutes
backwards seeing stuff from 20 minutes
ago oh yeah the uh the main thing that
ago oh yeah the uh the main thing that
was happening though before that was
was happening though before that was
preventing it from doing anything was
preventing it from doing anything was
um the reward structure it's a very easy
um the reward structure it's a very easy
to screw up continuous rewards you kind
to screw up continuous rewards you kind
of want to have rewards be expressed as
of want to have rewards be expressed as
a Delta so like if I get closer I get a
a Delta so like if I get closer I get a
reward not I get a reward based on my
reward not I get a reward based on my
distance it's interesting that it's
distance it's interesting that it's
actually getting some positive reward
actually getting some positive reward
for what it's doing here probably means
for what it's doing here probably means
I just have misspecified the reward more
I just have misspecified the reward more
than anything
but now we can uh we can build it and we
but now we can uh we can build it and we
can play
it can build it and we can play
it see doesn't actually show reward for
it see doesn't actually show reward for
for
this we'll rebuild it and print the
this we'll rebuild it and print the
rewards
out okay
out okay
so we're getting positive reward for
so we're getting positive reward for
what we're doing
what we're doing
here gets negative reward if we do this
here gets negative reward if we do this
right
can see you're getting negative reward
can see you're getting negative reward
by doing
stuff yeah it should be able to get
stuff yeah it should be able to get
positive reward not just
positive reward not just
negative but look at our train curve for
negative but look at our train curve for
this
thing oh oh it actually look it got it
thing oh oh it actually look it got it
and then something
and then something
happened it got a a KL
happened it got a a KL
Spike
Spike
interesting so they're actually it did
interesting so they're actually it did
solve it and then it uh it got
solve it and then it uh it got
destabilized somehow
that's
interesting I mean I have what looked
interesting I mean I have what looked
like very stable
parameters what if
rewarding if the direction vector
rewarding if the direction vector
is pointing to the
is pointing to the
objective yeah you can do something like
objective yeah you can do something like
that uh this is like debugging very
that uh this is like debugging very
basic things here there are lots of
basic things here there are lots of
things that we can do better here um and
things that we can do better here um and
actually ironically this is a problem
actually ironically this is a problem
where you're allowed to mess with the
where you're allowed to mess with the
rewards right because you're allowed to
rewards right because you're allowed to
make rewards based on like physical
make rewards based on like physical
orientation of the rocket like you would
orientation of the rocket like you would
be able to do that in the real rocket
be able to do that in the real rocket
problem
problem
right that's very easy to
do I don't know why this is set to
four I think that makes a

mil 20
mil let's comment this
thing and see if it learns now and after
thing and see if it learns now and after
that we're going to give it a much
that we're going to give it a much
harder task
okay so this is going to train for a
okay so this is going to train for a
couple minutes I'm going to go grab
couple minutes I'm going to go grab
myself a cup of tea and
myself a cup of tea and
um then we're going to actually make
um then we're going to actually make
this be the full task hopefully be right
this be the full task hopefully be right

sweep to see the physics that's what I'm
sweep to see the physics that's what I'm
doing yeah that's what I'm doing here is
doing yeah that's what I'm doing here is
because just yeah the the solution is
because just yeah the the solution is
usually to run a sweep but only when you
usually to run a sweep but only when you
think that you have the environment
think that you have the environment
mostly figured out there's like a ton of
mostly figured out there's like a ton of
Jank physic stuff going on
here okay so what happened now
here okay so what happened now
um there's like instability in learning
um there's like instability in learning
there's instability with physics there's
there's instability with physics there's
like lots of weird stuff going
like lots of weird stuff going
on so this is what we just did
it's just not learning a very good
policy and it's not very
policy and it's not very
stable I don't know
stable I don't know
why is it just like learning rate or
something do I have some dumb parameter
something do I have some dumb parameter
here that I'm not
seeing
seeing
48 a giant batch of
48 a giant batch of
data actually do we even have a big
data actually do we even have a big
enough batch hold on this might be it so
enough batch hold on this might be it so
was it 2 18 maybe yeah over
was it 2 18 maybe yeah over
8192 so only 32 yeah this is kind of
small is this going to even slow it down
small is this going to even slow it down
if I just do this
what if I do V multiprocessing
here
two batch size must be
divisible num M's

this kind of just doing this in the
background please do remember to start

the puffer repository it really helps us
let's see does anybody actually start it
let's see does anybody actually start it
today oh yeah it's gotten like an extra
today oh yeah it's gotten like an extra
like 10 15 Stars
like 10 15 Stars
today look at that nice little
today look at that nice little
uptick that's
great the only uh growth metrics I track
great the only uh growth metrics I track
are stars on the repo and followers on x
I'm going to have to shift over to
I'm going to have to shift over to
tracking MMR mrr
tracking MMR mrr
eventually
eventually
um but for now we're kind of just
um but for now we're kind of just
chilling the open source is
good so is it getting unstable here
good so is it getting unstable here
what's going
on why does it get stuck around zero you
on why does it get stuck around zero you
know
kind of weird how this policy
kind of weird how this policy
is I trained it at 260k so that's a nice
is I trained it at 260k so that's a nice
that's a nice speed bump at
least so we can actually run physic Sims
least so we can actually run physic Sims
very quickly in fact I know we can go
very quickly in fact I know we can go
even faster than that as
even faster than that as
well why does it get stuck around here
well why does it get stuck around here
it really I can't think of any reason
it really I can't think of any reason
reason it should get stuck except that
reason it should get stuck except that
the policy seems to become
the policy seems to become
unstable what would make the policy
unstable I could just be
unstable I could just be
hypers what
hypers what
is it yes it theck roet just spawning on
is it yes it theck roet just spawning on
the same spot and if the rocket goes too
the same spot and if the rocket goes too
far off the screen it gets
far off the screen it gets
reset should be pretty
reset should be pretty
simple so I would like to see it solve
simple so I would like to see it solve
this like very easy
this like very easy
problem it doesn't even have to do
problem it doesn't even have to do
anything it just has to turn off all its
anything it just has to turn off all its
engines and gently drift to the ground
gra me crazy
this reward skill should be decent as
well it's possible the reward scale got
well it's possible the reward scale got
to be too
to be too
large for something this dense I doubt
it I mean I'll try this just in case cuz
it I mean I'll try this just in case cuz
this is quick
anyways oh and now would be a good time
anyways oh and now would be a good time
to
yes there's a way
still
still
negative is it
negative is it
um let's see if it's more stable
n it's about the
n it's about the
same it's about the same as
same it's about the same as
before I don't like how these stats
before I don't like how these stats
explode like this it's kind of
explode like this it's kind of
weird right for this policy to be like
this that's actually very
odd learning rate is nice and low
got a nice big batch of
got a nice big batch of
data I don't see any parameters that
data I don't see any parameters that
could cause instability
here yeah I don't see
anything I'm trying to think what I
anything I'm trying to think what I
could be missing
answer some stuff in the meantime
oh cuz it's
Mouse for
not
this do I like is the learning rate just
this do I like is the learning rate just
massively too high or
something at least these experiments are
something at least these experiments are
very
very
quick I have a couple things to do in
quick I have a couple things to do in
the meantime before I have to think too
the meantime before I have to think too
hard about it
this is awesome
so many people we've got like 10
so many people we've got like 10
different people today they're all like
different people today they're all like
wanting to hop in
so so so so many people that's great
so so so so many people that's great
it's really really
great I mean for all of its faults X is
great I mean for all of its faults X is

a really good platform for

this morning was kind of tired felt like
this morning was kind of tired felt like
going on a tweet storm and now we've got
going on a tweet storm and now we've got
10 new people hopping into the Discord
10 new people hopping into the Discord

bought a bunch of lava lamps in
bought a bunch of lava lamps in
undergrad I had some great blunder
years okay so this thing is still not
years okay so this thing is still not
getting positive reward somehow which is
getting positive reward somehow which is
very
very
odd um it's a very easy to learn
odd um it's a very easy to learn
task let me see previous
X oh wait am I stupid
yeah this
says this is rewarding you based on
says this is rewarding you based on
distance from previous yeah this is
distance from previous yeah this is
insane isn't it hold
on two
oh wait is this
correct is this correct
um actually no I this is correct isn't
um actually no I this is correct isn't
it you get rewarded for decreasing the
it you get rewarded for decreasing the
magnitude of X or
Y
Y
yeah so this should be fine
um things that bother me are the
um things that bother me are the
stability of the training
stability of the training
runs but it really should be able to
runs but it really should be able to
solve something like this like this is
solve something like this like this is
very very
very very
easy
um curious how it gets to nearly
um curious how it gets to nearly
zero as well
is there a reason for
that I actually and I saw it Spike up to
that I actually and I saw it Spike up to
like 30 or something as
like 30 or something as
well it just wasn't
well it just wasn't
stable there a reason that it wasn't
stable there a reason that it wasn't
stable
stable
oops I do this this reward like this
oops I do this this reward like this
extra reward messing with it somehow
look at all these new people
good
good
progress oh
why value
loss a value loss gets
loss a value loss gets
learned
no what is it that getting stuck around
zero trying to think what it is that's
zero trying to think what it is that's
getting
getting
stuck around
zero for
a weird
model that definitely shouldn't be
model that definitely shouldn't be
getting positive reward
hold on I think that there's probably
hold on I think that there's probably
something that I'm not understanding
something that I'm not understanding
with like the
with like the
rotation let me just see real quick if
rotation let me just see real quick if
this works if this doesn't work then
this works if this doesn't work then
there's something seriously
wrong literally just has to learn to not
wrong literally just has to learn to not
engage
thrusters e
still not
learning is this like entropy screwing
learning is this like entropy screwing
us over or something
I'd be surprised if something that small
I'd be surprised if something that small
if the entropy coefficient that small
if the entropy coefficient that small
was messing with
us guess stranger things have
happened I'd be very surprised though
yeah that wasn't a magical fix
there's like something that I'm missing
there's like something that I'm missing
here it gets reset on
step this
and that's just one step it really
and that's just one step it really
shouldn't make a difference

any man you log some metrics and you
watch it play the
environment this is one of the reasons
environment this is one of the reasons
that we like games so much is because
that we like games so much is because
they are visually
interpretable I mean the thing that's
interpretable I mean the thing that's
going to happen EV here right is
going to happen EV here right is
like we're going to have a whole bunch
like we're going to have a whole bunch
of M that are super fast and that we
of M that are super fast and that we
know are good so if you mess with your
know are good so if you mess with your
algorithm you know you're going to be
algorithm you know you're going to be
able to know for sure whether you just
able to know for sure whether you just
broke your training code or something
broke your training code or something
fundamental because you're going to be
fundamental because you're going to be
able to train on known good environments
able to train on known good environments
incredibly
quickly right now in RL we have known
quickly right now in RL we have known
good environments but they're very
good environments but they're very
slow the ones that are fast are very
slow the ones that are fast are very
very simple like even simpler than pong
very simple like even simpler than pong
and breakout for the most part people
and breakout for the most part people
have like these really really dumb
have like these really really dumb
simple
environments e
put back the entropy
let me play the en
again obnoxious physic
s I'm not going to spend all day doing

this Z is not that that
this Z is not that that
important but I would like to get
important but I would like to get
something
something
whoops
okay it would be nice to have a
okay it would be nice to have a
physics of some
type you know I am noticing like
it's just very high
it's just very high

looking for grid World cart pole stuff
looking for grid World cart pole stuff
to start yeah puffer is the place
to start yeah puffer is the place
probably for that um cuz we have some
probably for that um cuz we have some
M's that are like very fast our pong en
M's that are like very fast our pong en
I think our pong en is probably a good
I think our pong en is probably a good
one to train right let's say
my train back
my train back
native okay let's just train pong live
native okay let's just train pong live
for
you we've got a little CNN lstm type
you we've got a little CNN lstm type
model
here and do our stats not
here and do our stats not
work I think our stats should
work I'm not seeing any stats
oh yep there they go they're just very
sparse okay so there you go 35 seconds
sparse okay so there you go 35 seconds
and pong is
and pong is
solved
solved
right oh no no no no it isn't my bad
right oh no no no no it isn't my bad
this is episode reward okay I forgot I
this is episode reward okay I forgot I
uh we haven't tuned it yet so the hyper
uh we haven't tuned it yet so the hyper
parameters are terrible I'm sure we will
parameters are terrible I'm sure we will
solve it in 30 seconds because we've
solve it in 30 seconds because we've
basically done that before
basically done that before
um hold on pong has a really weird
um hold on pong has a really weird
learning
learning
curve you'll
see okay so here's this rep episode
see okay so here's this rep episode
return here's episode
return here's episode
score pong has like this takeoff curve
score pong has like this takeoff curve
with learning
come
on should way be solved by
now apparently I broke it with one of
now apparently I broke it with one of
the updates that's obnoxious which is
the updates that's obnoxious which is
very weird because we actually have it
very weird because we actually have it
deployed on the website
um I'm trying to think should I try
um I'm trying to think should I try
breakout
breakout
instead I'm could do
instead I'm could do
breakout I did also just mess with
breakout I did also just mess with
breakout
though
oh I think it
recovers yeah there it goes okay it
recovers yeah there it goes okay it
recovered
recovered
so we don't have amazing hyper
so we don't have amazing hyper
parameters tuned for this thing um but
parameters tuned for this thing um but
I'm just training this locally on my
I'm just training this locally on my
desktop here
and I guess it wasn't very stable this
and I guess it wasn't very stable this
run let me find you something better so
run let me find you something better so
if you wanted to literally train cart
pole so this is cart Pole
yeah so there's like some little hitch
yeah so there's like some little hitch
here otherwise it would have gone
here otherwise it would have gone
straight um here's cart pole being
straight um here's cart pole being
optimized I think like 100 or 200 or
optimized I think like 100 or 200 or
whatever is the intended target so
whatever is the intended target so
cartpole you just solve it very quickly
cartpole you just solve it very quickly
no problem
there remaining 30 seconds okay we'll
there remaining 30 seconds okay we'll
just let this train and then we'll show
just let this train and then we'll show
you the policy if that rendering
Works
Works
70 very helpful did not no scope of

puffer so the fun thing with puffer is
puffer so the fun thing with puffer is
like you see me running this command
like you see me running this command
like this just to train but um it's not
like this just to train but um it's not
like sb3 the code is very transparent so
like sb3 the code is very transparent so
you can actually see all the training
you can actually see all the training
code very very easily and find where
code very very easily and find where
everything is and how everything works
everything is and how everything works
it's not meant to be a black boox thing
it's not meant to be a black boox thing
it's yeah so
like
EV hold

eval you see I got the ARG wrong and it
eval you see I got the ARG wrong and it
tells me that it gives me all the args
tells me that it gives me all the args
that you that are valid I just wrote it
that you that are valid I just wrote it
wrong okay and here's cartpole here's
wrong okay and here's cartpole here's
the model that we just
trained now now pong should literally
trained now now pong should literally
train in the amount of time that I
train in the amount of time that I
showed you before um we haven't done a
showed you before um we haven't done a
proper sweep I guess on that that's kind
proper sweep I guess on that that's kind
of
of
embarrassing Let's do let's do our
embarrassing Let's do let's do our
breakout let's see if I didn't break
that all these Ms are in Dev right so
that all these Ms are in Dev right so
like the new ones are uh not always the
like the new ones are uh not always the
most
most
stable that's one of the things we're
stable that's one of the things we're
trying to get all these contributors to
trying to get all these contributors to
help us
help us
fix but breakout I think should at least
fix but breakout I think should at least
have a consistent learn
have a consistent learn
curve okay yeah so here we
curve okay yeah so here we
go come on
there we go yeah there we go now it
there we go yeah there we go now it
takes off
um
um
just okay so now this is training
just okay so now this is training
breakout
breakout
live and we actually have the policies
live and we actually have the policies
deployed online for these like the
deployed online for these like the
pre-train policies
so you can actually watch the agent play
so you can actually watch the agent play
Breakout this is one that we trained
Breakout this is one that we trained
before it just plays in your browser
before it just plays in your browser
this is running live in your browser as
well like the network as well is just
well like the network as well is just
running
running
locally we also have the pong
locally we also have the pong
one this is if you actually train the
one this is if you actually train the
pong with you know better hyper prams or
whatever and we have some other things
whatever and we have some other things
as
as
well so lots of M's
well so lots of M's
there going to be more M we could
there going to be more M we could
definitely use help with them uh
definitely use help with them uh

in the track Mania video I like how they
in the track Mania video I like how they
display multiple agents and watch them
evolve I know this only happens post
evolve I know this only happens post
training yeah I mean if we if we have
training yeah I mean if we if we have
people that want to help us make cooler
people that want to help us make cooler
visualizations that would be great
yeah we definitely need better hyper
yeah we definitely need better hyper
prams for our simple M's cuz like our
prams for our simple M's cuz like our
breakout and our pong should both be
breakout and our pong should both be

you're doing all this course stuff it's
you're doing all this course stuff it's
good to learn things but like you
good to learn things but like you
probably actually have more than enough
probably actually have more than enough
um like background to actually be doing
um like background to actually be doing
productive work already um people will
productive work already um people will
be surprised to know I never read an RL
be surprised to know I never read an RL
textbook I also didn't ever take an RL
textbook I also didn't ever take an RL
course they didn't exist when I was um
course they didn't exist when I was um
you know doing my undergrad and stuff at
you know doing my undergrad and stuff at
the time there were not any courses I
the time there were not any courses I
guess there were some books still um but
guess there were some books still um but
for the most part I read a bunch of
for the most part I read a bunch of
papers and I did a bunch of
papers and I did a bunch of
RL and yeah there's some Theory stuff in
RL and yeah there's some Theory stuff in
there right that's kind of important but
there right that's kind of important but
also like half the time in RL you like
also like half the time in RL you like
make some weird approximation to the
make some weird approximation to the
algorithm and it ends up just being
algorithm and it ends up just being
faster and better um RL is a heavily
faster and better um RL is a heavily
heavily empirical
heavily empirical
science so yeah I don't know I would
science so yeah I don't know I would
just I would generally suggest people
just I would generally suggest people
just like getting involved and helping
just like getting involved and helping
with this stuff cuz like the reason that
with this stuff cuz like the reason that
RL is in such a bad place at the moment
RL is in such a bad place at the moment
is just purely because we never built
is just purely because we never built
fast and easy tools environments and
fast and easy tools environments and
infrastructure so that's what I'm
infrastructure so that's what I'm
approaching at the
moment like actually my playbook for
moment like actually my playbook for
most of my Dev it's 80%
most of my Dev it's 80%
engineering 15% like basic scientific
engineering 15% like basic scientific
method experiments and stuff and May
method experiments and stuff and May
maybe 5%
math so really I mean the main thing is
math so really I mean the main thing is
just for people to like start getting
just for people to like start getting
involved in like um you know taking on
involved in like um you know taking on
little environment projects shipping
little environment projects shipping
environment
environment
code as soon as we get a big enough
code as soon as we get a big enough
repository of like very nice fast and
repository of like very nice fast and
stable environments the whole field is
stable environments the whole field is
going to just be completely revamped
going to just be completely revamped
revamped because you're going to be able
revamped because you're going to be able
to get comprehensive experiment
to get comprehensive experiment
results across like 10 different
results across like 10 different
environments on one GPU in a day that's
environments on one GPU in a day that's
something that you cannot do at all at
something that you cannot do at all at
the moment in RL so you can be a lot
the moment in RL so you can be a lot
stupider about how you do things when
stupider about how you do things when
things are just fast enough for you to
things are just fast enough for you to
run all the experiments that you'd ever
want that's very much the way I look at
things where's this rocket Lander in
things where's this rocket Lander in
that's giving me
grief it's so weird that this is
grief it's so weird that this is
not oh wait yeah yeah we actually just
not oh wait yeah yeah we actually just
came up with a a thing here on this
came up with a a thing here on this
right let me see
what if I do like this oops one over
what if I do like this oops one over
10 then I do 24 sub steps do this work
okay so now the m is way faster it's
okay so now the m is way faster it's
actually funny that that feels
better puffers are resident Advertiser
bet is our resident Advertiser I
mean you called me puffer I am honored
mean you called me puffer I am honored
yeah I thought I did that but I wasn't
yeah I thought I did that but I wasn't
positive dude I swear I just like I fill
positive dude I swear I just like I fill
my head with so much crap doing all like
my head with so much crap doing all like
the Social Media stuff for puffer and
the Social Media stuff for puffer and
all the dev and all the reviews and
all the dev and all the reviews and
stuff I just end up cooking my brain
stuff I just end up cooking my brain
halfway through the
week start thank you for the
sport cook from this
run I've been doing um I think I did
run I've been doing um I think I did
like a
like a
924 paac is 5K this morning
I don't know I haven't been going fast
I don't know I haven't been going fast
too fast with the runs lately because
too fast with the runs lately because
it's mostly a strength
it's mostly a strength
block now 924 is considered quite
slow but I pulled 405 earlier this week
so the strength is
back yeah the running is not not too
back yeah the running is not not too
fun fitness very important
though next goal is going to be 1,000
though next goal is going to be 1,000
total and then after that it's going to
total and then after that it's going to
be th total and be running a
marathon because I'm slightly under
marathon because I'm slightly under
Marathon shape at the
Marathon shape at the
moment I'd have to do like um maybe five
moment I'd have to do like um maybe five
six week block to get back get my uh my
six week block to get back get my uh my
endurance back to from like half
endurance back to from like half
marathon to Marathon
[Music]
distance got to keep at
distance got to keep at
it okay I'm just why does this thing not
work like okay here hold on
work like okay here hold on
if
I okay here we have our rocket Lander M
I okay here we have our rocket Lander M
now
now
okay okay here's our rocket Lander
end it's kind of crazy how long the
end it's kind of crazy how long the
Horizon is on these t tasks right like I
Horizon is on these t tasks right like I
think the reward function is just shitty
think the reward function is just shitty
like you just take one action you press
like you just take one action you press
the key once and you see it shifts your
the key once and you see it shifts your
reward for like the next 30
steps it's probably all it is
I don't think it's anything fundamental
I don't think it's anything fundamental
with the algorithm actually
okay
idea what if I did
idea what if I did
this is this like bat
crazy last question is now you can ask
crazy last question is now you can ask
questions steering llm Behavior via RL
questions steering llm Behavior via RL
kind of within the culture fit for
kind of within the culture fit for
deing V so not really and let me tell
deing V so not really and let me tell
you
you
why the side of RL that I'm approaching
why the side of RL that I'm approaching
at the moment right the side of RL that
at the moment right the side of RL that
we're looking at is high throughput
we're looking at is high throughput
simulation anything to do it's not just
simulation anything to do it's not just
games either right anything that you can
games either right anything that you can
simulate fast so virtually get unlimited
simulate fast so virtually get unlimited
data the reason this is what we're
data the reason this is what we're
looking at is because it's a very
looking at is because it's a very
underinvested area of research it's one
underinvested area of research it's one
that's likely to be important for
that's likely to be important for
long-term progress in AI because there
long-term progress in AI because there
are a lot of problems that don't mesh
are a lot of problems that don't mesh
well with LMS where you do have lots of
well with LMS where you do have lots of
data uh and it fundamentally scales in a
data uh and it fundamentally scales in a
way that is different from llms like you
way that is different from llms like you
end up using tons and tons of data with
end up using tons and tons of data with
not much compute and not many parameters
not much compute and not many parameters
versus llms that end up using a ton of
versus llms that end up using a ton of
Compu and a ton of parameters with not
Compu and a ton of parameters with not
much
much
data um I do think that there is a place
data um I do think that there is a place
for llm with RL like a tie-in but the
for llm with RL like a tie-in but the
key for that is going to be you're going
key for that is going to be you're going
to have to have a small policy that the
to have to have a small policy that the
LM is mostly letting do the work and
LM is mostly letting do the work and
then once in a while when there's like a
then once in a while when there's like a
highle decision to be made then the llm
highle decision to be made then the llm
can take over the work a lot like how
can take over the work a lot like how
I'm not actively thinking about where
I'm not actively thinking about where
I'm moving my hands and stuff right now
I'm moving my hands and stuff right now
it's kind of just like
it's kind of just like
automatic you want RL to take the
automatic you want RL to take the
automatic portion
automatic portion
um yeah that's kind of the main area
um yeah that's kind of the main area
that's going to be like a future
that's going to be like a future
research thing but at the moment we're
research thing but at the moment we're
mostly looking at High throughput Sim in
mostly looking at High throughput Sim in
that area of things which to be fair is
that area of things which to be fair is
an area that you can actually make a
an area that you can actually make a
difference in without having to have a
difference in without having to have a
gigantic
cluster Iceberg video should be a very
cluster Iceberg video should be a very
good primer on RL and where I see the
good primer on RL and where I see the
field going and such it's exciting to me
field going and such it's exciting to me
because this is a space where there
because this is a space where there
really aren't a lot of people doing this
really aren't a lot of people doing this
stuff so like this literally will not
stuff so like this literally will not
get done um if I don't do it in puffer
get done um if I don't do it in puffer
so tremendous chance for impact on the
so tremendous chance for impact on the
science of it and also you can do this
science of it and also you can do this
stuff at pretty darn low compute
stuff at pretty darn low compute
resource scale um pretty much anybody
resource scale um pretty much anybody
can just like code up an interesting
can just like code up an interesting
environment and immediately

contribute massively to the

ah
ah
okay
so I'm curious to see if this is going
so I'm curious to see if this is going
to work just you know for the sake of it
to work just you know for the sake of it

sorts of different contributions in

games is good control stuff and physics

actually for like science type people uh
actually for like science type people uh
I have a project in mind there as well
I have a project in mind there as well
that's going to be like still building

very very
bright the biggest thing though right
bright the biggest thing though right
now like in the short term in my mind I
now like in the short term in my mind I
really want to ship 1.1 as an official
really want to ship 1.1 as an official
update like as soon as possible ideally
update like as soon as possible ideally
I'd like to ship it in the next couple
I'd like to ship it in the next couple
weeks before I go back to Florida um
weeks before I go back to Florida um
which means having like the 10 stable
which means having like the 10 stable
environments and baselines and all that
environments and baselines and all that
stuff it's just God so much work
H so so much
work okay seriously what is wrong with
work okay seriously what is wrong with
these
environments for
I have it
zero for
like bothering me that I can't figure
like bothering me that I can't figure
out why this is so
screwy like this one shouldn't be that
screwy like this one shouldn't be that
complicated I wouldn't
think what happened here
policy doesn't make any freaking sense
see okay you know what we're going to
see okay you know what we're going to
do we're going to be a little more
do we're going to be a little more
pragmatic about this
[Music]
go like this
we're going to just see if we can train
we're going to just see if we can train
it to learn a single fixed action
it to learn a single fixed action
because I think that there's a bug
why is it still 33
oh because I didn't the
time
time
on what did we set this to
episode return is zero
can it not output zero or
something yeah something's definitely
something yeah something's definitely
screwy
screwy
here oh I wonder if it's the same bug
here oh I wonder if it's the same bug
from before
from before
actually that'd be real embarrassing
actually that'd be real embarrassing
wouldn't
wouldn't
it hold on
load actions
oh
oh
wait I mess up
wait I mess up
massively I messed up massively didn't
I I messed up massively hold on I found
I I messed up massively hold on I found
it yeah this is guaranteed it
what is it hold
on
Lo got to be this right
for e
so we have
actions rewards look
actions rewards look
good so why
oh is it just not getting log pulled on
yeah I will fix this thing
yeah I will fix this thing
even if it ends up being something very
silly I hate how this uh automatically
silly I hate how this uh automatically
indents for
you
zero I I really don't care if this makes
zero I I really don't care if this makes
me look stupid like I'm I'm going to
me look stupid like I'm I'm going to
find this stupid bug and I'm going to
find this stupid bug and I'm going to
fix it it's going to be some dumb data
fix it it's going to be some dumb data
thing
guaranteed
okay I mean one of the reasons I am so
okay I mean one of the reasons I am so
incredibly insistent on the RL code
incredibly insistent on the RL code
bases being like simple simple simple
bases being like simple simple simple
simple including the like the
simple including the like the
environments including the training

including everything is because RL is
including everything is because RL is
kind of cursed and stuff will go wrong
kind of cursed and stuff will go wrong
and it will go horribly wrong like you
and it will go horribly wrong like you
do not want to be waiting through five
do not want to be waiting through five
layers of fang
layers of fang
abstractions in RL you just don't it's
abstractions in RL you just don't it's
not a good time trust me
no
okay there we go so
why is episode length
one all right there's more stuff to find
one all right there's more stuff to find
here I'm going to be right back grab
here I'm going to be right back grab
more tea use the restro and then we're
more tea use the restro and then we're
going to fix this um do we have anything
going to fix this um do we have anything
else toly to
that's
funny Kung made a little
page that guy need some assistance uh I
page that guy need some assistance uh I
think he was asking for like a
think he was asking for like a
substantial feature for stuff I'll be
substantial feature for stuff I'll be
right back
right back
though
e
e
e
e
e
e
e e
uhoh and not knock that not knock that
over hi welcome
that's
funny it made like some react app that's
funny it made like some react app that's
so silly
wait it actually went up it trained
wait it actually went up it trained
more that's
more that's
bizarre let's figure out why
um me figure something out here
okay rocket
okay rocket
[Music]
Lander oh it's cuz literally nothing
Lander oh it's cuz literally nothing
happens question
happens question
mark That's
mark That's
render FPS
why do nothing
happen reset
something is just like bizarre
here what
rewind
321 uh reward
oh wait we didn't I messed this up
oh wait we didn't I messed this up
didn't
I okay so here we have rocket Lander
I okay so here we have rocket Lander
which is constantly resetting
transform
transform
Y is
uh how's that make any sense where do I
uh how's that make any sense where do I
start
start
it where's the initial position
initial
initial
y it's 500
right transform equal
pause 500 so you get the Lander
ID the rust
scale oh is it just just like launching
scale oh is it just just like launching
it I'm
it I'm
confused let's
do
zero thank you to bet our resident
zero thank you to bet our resident
advertising
here most amusing bet do star the puffer
here most amusing bet do star the puffer
star the repo helps me out a lot
okay so somehow this transform is
okay so somehow this transform is
completely
bonked is it 120 like
how how is it
how how is it
120 reset
why is this transform like
why is this transform like
so messed
up Lander ID
it's Lander ID not uh barge ID right
evening extremely
weird am I just not understanding
weird am I just not understanding
something about how
something about how
um how this physics engine works or is
um how this physics engine works or is
it just glitchy or like what
just do like
this it did not
compile compute observations
you have to do like this don't
you how does this transform go
okay so
pause so when you step
pause so when you step
this did I mess up the step function
this did I mess up the step function
hold
on I'd really just like to have this
on I'd really just like to have this
working today because
working today because
um there's somebody who hopefully is
um there's somebody who hopefully is
going to help on this over the weekend
going to help on this over the weekend
and I'd like to have um a basic demo I
and I'd like to have um a basic demo I
don't want to just be fighting with
don't want to just be fighting with
something totally cursed I mean the
something totally cursed I mean the
really the goal is to just have this
really the goal is to just have this
thing just do something basic today and
thing just do something basic today and
then also maybe fix up the rendering so
then also maybe fix up the rendering so
it looks kind of
it looks kind of
cool I should be able to get it done if
cool I should be able to get it done if
I don't get just stuck on this all
I don't get just stuck on this all
day and it's really kind of
day and it's really kind of
silly there rocket Lander
was all in
was all in
C oh do I not have any of this
C oh do I not have any of this
committed I should probably do
committed I should probably do
that let's commit up all code real quick
oh was it one over oh I know what I know
oh was it one over oh I know what I know
what it is I'm just dumb okay
okay I remember rocket Lander that's
okay I remember rocket Lander that's
what I'm doing right now is I'm trying
what I'm doing right now is I'm trying
to fix that
to fix that
project
okay okay I think this is back to
normal just
normal just
falling now balls very
falling now balls very
slowly and make it yep
slowly and make it yep
I'm so
I'm so
now get rid of these print
TS and set
up and we can run the sanity check to
up and we can run the sanity check to
see if it actually can learn to just
see if it actually can learn to just
like press a button or if I have
like press a button or if I have
something fundamentally wrong with the
something fundamentally wrong with the
the bindings
something appears fundamentally wrong
not learning to press a
button value loss
is very
high well actually now it learned kind
high well actually now it learned kind
of yeah so why wait why the heck was
of yeah so why wait why the heck was
that so
hard I'm kind of suspicious of this
and the fact that the value loss is so
and the fact that the value loss is so
messed up
actions of zero
what do we get we get float
actions I through I +
1 and then you pass float
1 and then you pass float
actions which is num

wrong with this
crazy rocket end
[Music]
okay so on
here seems to
here seems to
work these are normal leaks that's fine
perf
test looks good
test looks good
500k uh and you also you're not
500k uh and you also you're not
compiling this in fast mode mod either
compiling this in fast mode mod either
so you're actually it's 500k on slow
so you're actually it's 500k on slow
mode probably way faster on fast mode
huh a dress sanitizer takes a lot of
huh a dress sanitizer takes a lot of
time apparently not in this case that's
time apparently not in this case that's
very weird never seen that
before um well whatever
and then let's
see training supposed to seg fold
immediately unless this didn't
immediately unless this didn't
compile
see works for
see works for
you looks like it
seg fult straight away from
me that's pretty
weird uh
that's very
weird yeah just like I can run it and
weird yeah just like I can run it and
play
it I'm kind of curious to
it I'm kind of curious to
see what was this thre mil
see what was this thre mil
this train is very
this train is very
slow so I'm actually suspicious as to
slow so I'm actually suspicious as to
whether it's compiling
correctly NE
four hold on I'm a little suspicious
four hold on I'm a little suspicious
because uh it doesn't seem to be running
because uh it doesn't seem to be running
as fast as it should be it's like
as fast as it should be it's like
running with like the speed of the old
running with like the speed of the old
version or something
six
like
like
I 20
yeah 59 60% M
time
time
try oh well hold on should be two and
two processing
M doesn't appear to be quite
M doesn't appear to be quite
fast but
fast but
uh say 48% M
uh say 48% M
time faster on my
MacBook well we're at 430k
now trying to figure out here let's do
now trying to figure out here let's do
cuz I'm not sure that this is actually
cuz I'm not sure that this is actually
being compiled
being compiled
correctly going to do print F
step let's see if this is actually
compiling yep it is compiling so we're
compiling yep it is compiling so we're
running the right
code 4096 n
kind of suspicious the M
kind of suspicious the M
Speed doesn't seem to matter how you
compile fast for local testing
I guess we're just dropping perk in the
I guess we're just dropping perk in the
scon layer or something
something's
bizarre loads
and of curious
and of curious
uh how this
uh how this
does what's it like score of one is
does what's it like score of one is
solved
I mean the stats look
good okay so it should be able to get a
good okay so it should be able to get a
score of one
so it just save
so it just save
checkpoint 85% win
checkpoint 85% win
rate I'll let this run until it saves
rate I'll let this run until it saves
checkpoint 150 and then I'll watch
it interestingly it looks like it's
it interestingly it looks like it's
stuck it's stuck just below 90% win rate
stuck it's stuck just below 90% win rate
maybe oh no
what my connect
what my connect
for
for
eval made of
uh I think it's actually winning
uh I think it's actually winning
right did it figure how to exploit the
right did it figure how to exploit the
model or is it just that
model or is it just that
good I see a lot of similar
good I see a lot of similar
games is it always the same game it's
games is it always the same game it's
not always the same
game no it's not always but yeah this
game no it's not always but yeah this
thing is kind of good isn't
it
h i will
can you beat it probably not we'll
see I'm going to wait for it to finish
see I'm going to wait for it to finish
training the 100 Mil and I'll ship it to
training the 100 Mil and I'll ship it to
the web as well why
not then you all can see if you can beat
not then you all can see if you can beat
it we can ship uh we ship a model real
quick it's a shape
quick it's a shape
it's a shame you can't play versus it
it's a shame you can't play versus it
well I think what we're going to do is
well I think what we're going to do is
we're going to we're going to let you
we're going to we're going to let you
watch the RL agent play against the
watch the RL agent play against the
scripted opponent and then you can play
scripted opponent and then you can play
against the scripted opponent so you can
against the scripted opponent so you can
take over for the bot to see if you can
take over for the bot to see if you can
do any
do any
better we could also flip it around so
better we could also flip it around so
that you play versus the neural
that you play versus the neural
net neither of these are very
hard you'd have to strip out the
hard you'd have to strip out the
scripted we just make a flag right that
scripted we just make a flag right that
just overwrites the action or
just overwrites the action or
whatever not a big
whatever not a big
deal all right
so let me show you the process let me
so let me show you the process let me
show you how easy it is to like add a
show you how easy it is to like add a
model into pure
ciments Connect
ciments Connect
4 956
model
model
382 uh let's see connect for
382 uh let's see connect for
weights
PT going to
PT going to
be or
weights four weights. bin
okay so now we have this
okay so now we have this
model
um config
um config
[Music]
[Music]
ocean oh it's literally just playing
ocean oh it's literally just playing
with the default policy and it's still
with the default policy and it's still
able to win that's kind of
able to win that's kind of
weird okay
really need to sleep yeah go sleep man
really need to sleep yeah go sleep man
you wake up to a nice model online that
you wake up to a nice model online that
you can play
with thanks for this thanks for the
with thanks for this thanks for the
contributions
we can chat up weekend Monday Tuesday
we can chat up weekend Monday Tuesday
whenever see
you all right so we don't have model
you all right so we don't have model
code in here at the
moment we can just grab this from pong
uh wake up to a model lady model every
uh wake up to a model lady model every
day
please do star the repository it helps
please do star the repository it helps

what how's it going
Nathan M actions
this the greyhound racing
[Music]
coding a few spells cool very
nice I'm trying to think how how I want
nice I'm trying to think how how I want
to do this little bit of code right
here shift to take over for the
bot like this
default so it's 42 and then action space
default so it's 42 and then action space
is
is
seven believe it's like 42 and
7 okay and now what we actually have to
7 okay and now what we actually have to
do is
upper. num agents
upper. num agents
perfect so uh we're just going to
perfect so uh we're just going to
make uh default
net default
net default
default okay and then this is going to
default okay and then this is going to
take was it linear
it's got an
encoder actor value function I think
encoder actor value function I think
there a couple relu
maybe me
maybe me
see encoder
see encoder
is encoder
is encoder
re and then decoder
re and then decoder
oh it's just
oh it's just
decoder it's just uh linear Rel
linear and then multi-
linear and then multi-
discreete multi-
discreet say num
agents input Dam make linear make Rel
agents input Dam make linear make Rel
make linear value function multi-
make linear value function multi-
discreet actually very
discreet actually very
easy input Di
easy input Di
I don't know why it said this is hidden
I don't know why it said this is hidden
dim this is action
dim this is action
dim input
dim
dim
oh
oh
yeah hidden
yeah hidden
dim input hidden action we can even
dim input hidden action we can even
do then value function
do then value function
goes hidden dim to action dim I believe
goes hidden dim to action dim I believe
and then multi
discreete make
discreete make
multi discret is logic
multi discret is logic
sizes action
dim and then one
right we just make
right we just make
a
a
default to do a free
function
function
OBS coder yep we free
OBS coder yep we free
everything and then a
everything and then a
forward for
forward for
default linear
default linear
REO linear
linear actor value function okay so we
linear actor value function okay so we
should actually be good
already ocean
we all we do need to know
we all we do need to know
the size of this
the size of this
network so what we will
do okay 60 this is a Tiny
do okay 60 this is a Tiny
Network
Network
six tiny little net
do
interactive with puffet
Doh too few arguments to make default
Doh too few arguments to make default
uh I believe we have 128 Default hidden
dim
and
incompatible
observations expected float argument is
observations expected float argument is
of type unsigned
of type unsigned
Char uh fair
Char uh fair
enough so
enough so
we'll have to
we'll have to
do
do
float
observations we'll just copy this
in and then we'll just do observations
in and then we'll just do observations
an
address let's
address let's
see what other stuff we have to
X input is a
type unsigned
char did not save this
why is this an unsigned
sh make default
sh make default
here we pass
here we pass
[Music]
[Music]
in a linear
in a linear
layer right oh I don't know
layer right oh I don't know
why this is
why this is
dumb why did it do this
signed in actions
perfect okay now we just have argmax
perfect okay now we just have argmax
things
what happens if we just run
it we get an
it we get an
overflow on the multi discret okay
overflow on the multi discret okay
that's
that's
deserved yeah that's deserved
unsign charar
actions actions
I don't know why it does
this okay so here we
go now we have a thing that runs but
go now we have a thing that runs but
it's clearly not running the correct
it's clearly not running the correct
thing
right let's see what our network
is make
default what did we provide we said One
default what did we provide we said One
agent 42 input 128 hidden and
output appears to be
correct calic num agents times the input
correct calic num agents times the input
dim
yeah and then we do this in make
yeah and then we do this in make
linear input to Hidden this is the
encoder make Rel with the hidden
encoder make Rel with the hidden
dim and the actor here goes from hidden
dim and the actor here goes from hidden
dim to action
dim to action
dim and then value
dim and then value
function di to
function di to
one and logit
one and logit
sizes is what we do
sizes is what we do
here and this is actually already
here and this is actually already
looking
looking
fine and then what do we do we
fine and then what do we do we
do linear
do linear
on
on
OBS and and then we re and then we actor
OBS and and then we re and then we actor
and then we value
function well we can soft Max multi-
function well we can soft Max multi-
discreete no reason not to think that
discreete no reason not to think that
changes anything
though let's actually read the errors
actions is going to be an unsigned
int okay well that's a
problem let's
see expected int but got unsigned int
wait expected int got unsigned
int um I can do int star action
right
right
okay and then we have what soft Max
soft Mac takes int not unsigned in is
soft Mac takes int not unsigned in is
that
that
it so this actually should be
int expected int but it's getting
int expected int but it's getting
unsigned in
where's this
happening 465
oh I know what the problem
is I thought I know what the problem
is I thought I know what the problem
was why is this uh
I have no idea why this
I have no idea why this
is scy here because this should be
fun error
oh I see this is just a static yeah this
oh I see this is just a static yeah this
is fine we'll just do
this that's such a really like a
this that's such a really like a
ridiculous warning as well
I have to do
um
instar okay does this actually work is
instar okay does this actually work is
the question after all
the question after all
that oh yeah
and then what do we have to do
and then what do we have to do
here we
do sleep or
do sleep or
something
for e
0.5 not work
sleep
Ms oh you sleep
there we go
why is blue not winning the
game I think there's some bugs
maybe if I hold shift
maybe if I hold shift
I can take over I think
right I don't
right I don't
know it just let Blue
know it just let Blue
win I'm
win I'm
confused I don't I just win if I press
confused I don't I just win if I press
here yeah I do if I do put it in three
okay so like I
okay so like I
like
like
they this is not an allowed
state right
a PR from before
I got the network loaded in
though that's
cool for
all
all
right so at least I got uh I got that
right so at least I got uh I got that
integrated we'll have to go back to the
integrated we'll have to go back to the
rocket I think for a bit I'll leave this
rocket I think for a bit I'll leave this
up for a second I'll be right back the
restroom
e
e
e
e e
okay couple Twitter people I think more
okay couple Twitter people I think more
contributors be live for another hour or
contributors be live for another hour or
two
anyways as well drop some
anyways as well drop some
replies oops
I thought we had comments or
I thought we had comments or
something I missed something
there that's what I was that's what I

so what we're doing at the moment is I
so what we're doing at the moment is I
have this uh this rocket Lander en I
have this uh this rocket Lander en I
mean here you go Falcon 9 based on in
mean here you go Falcon 9 based on in
honor of uh the recent rocket stuff uh I
honor of uh the recent rocket stuff uh I
found this old en where is
found this old en where is
it yeah here it is there's this old
it yeah here it is there's this old
rocket en and it's really slow because
rocket en and it's really slow because
it's in Python so I'm trying to Port
it's in Python so I'm trying to Port
this stuff to C and get this working
this stuff to C and get this working
with RL and it's kind of just being a

Christmas
Christmas
maybe elon's usually right longterm he
maybe elon's usually right longterm he
sometimes misses on the time predictions
sometimes misses on the time predictions
so I don't know if it'll be better after
so I don't know if it'll be better after
Christmas or it'll be better like you
Christmas or it'll be better like you
know in a couple of years or whatever
know in a couple of years or whatever
we'll see
I think it is likely they'll do pretty
I think it is likely they'll do pretty
well there are a couple weird things
well there are a couple weird things
with their Tech stack um and a couple of
with their Tech stack um and a couple of
The Hires that they made are a
The Hires that they made are a
little wow I don't want to go into too
little wow I don't want to go into too
much there but
much there but
like there are a few ways that could
like there are a few ways that could
potentially go
wrong I think that they probably just
wrong I think that they probably just
win on distribution though because it's
win on distribution though because it's
literally it's in it's directly in X so
literally it's in it's directly in X so
they're probably just win on
they're probably just win on
distribution
distribution

good I know people realize they can
good I know people realize they can
cancel their chat GPT subscription and
cancel their chat GPT subscription and
just keep their
Twitter but that's less interesting
Twitter but that's less interesting
right that's like it's less interesting
right that's like it's less interesting
than making better
Tech all right let's see why is
this what is wrong with this n
here let's just do this for now
[Music]
[Music]
TR saves folks 4 100 bucks
yeah I don't know I would
yeah I don't know I would
I'd frankly I'd be quite happy to stop
I'd frankly I'd be quite happy to stop
financially supporting open AI with all
financially supporting open AI with all
the uh the
the uh the
regulatory capture
that does irritate me quite a
bit I mean they still some really
bit I mean they still some really
awesome people there though I will say I
awesome people there though I will say I
think Alec is still there a couple other
think Alec is still there a couple other
people I
know let's see what this policy does
triggers
triggers
are
teachers I don't know about
teachers I don't know about
that se
fa uh rocket Lander mod EV
though what did I mess up Evo metal
path what do I think about what
that random saying I mean it's like a py
that random saying I mean it's like a py
saying that doesn't really hold up like
saying that doesn't really hold up like
if you think about it it doesn't really
if you think about it it doesn't really
make sense does
it this again
it shouldn't be pressing any
buttons very
buttons very
weird our triggers are our
teachers I don't
know sometimes things irritate you
know sometimes things irritate you
because you're being stubborn but
because you're being stubborn but
sometimes things irritate you because
sometimes things irritate you because
they're just stupid
GPT uh no it's not language models are
GPT uh no it's not language models are
good it's like the
good it's like the
marketing uh and the Zeitgeist around
marketing uh and the Zeitgeist around
them that bothers me more than
them that bothers me more than
anything like we had um like all the nft
anything like we had um like all the nft
Bros and like cryptos scammers kind of
Bros and like cryptos scammers kind of
moved over to AI when AI got big and
moved over to AI when AI got big and
like I would just I would like those
like I would just I would like those
people out that would be nice because
people out that would be nice because
like we're trying to do legit science
like we're trying to do legit science
and engineering here
right kind of just like
right kind of just like
bches what we're trying to
do no marketing doesn't bother me
do no marketing doesn't bother me
marketing that's not exactly honest
marketing that's not exactly honest
bothers me
Freedom's
good you're going to have to try harder
good you're going to have to try harder
than that if you're
trolling non-engineers bother you no
trolling non-engineers bother you no
dishonest dishonesty bothers me
and I'm answering
and I'm answering
questions okay I mean if you I couldn't
questions okay I mean if you I couldn't
tell it's like you don't exactly get
tell it's like you don't exactly get
tone over text but
yeah I didn't say that
some marketing is
dishonest
dishonest
okay uh I don't think it is
okay uh I don't think it is
inherently doesn't have to
be why is this
this is crazy that this doesn't
work hold on if I
work hold on if I
do no it's the train setting was fine
well bad marketing can be dishonest
well bad marketing can be dishonest
marketing can be effective and honest
marketing can be effective and honest
effective and dishonest can be
effective and dishonest can be
ineffective and honest it can be
ineffective and honest it can be
ineffective and dishonest right
good and honest yeah sure that's fine
bizarre we just have too many
M's this is what I use for everything
M's this is what I use for everything
else though
company failure bother
you I don't know what you mean
yeah I'm mostly trying to figure out how
yeah I'm mostly trying to figure out how
to get this m to
work I
mean it could just be that it takes
mean it could just be that it takes

if by consumer you mean customer we have
if by consumer you mean customer we have
one we have a little landing page on

stuff did I mess this up
something happened
something happened
weird wasn't paying attention
oh I didn't mess up something weird that
oh I didn't mess up something weird that
just got
just got
corrupted okay that was
corrupted okay that was
weird whatever
there we go
the users
there we
go okay
so server
look at
look at
that look at
that look at
that now it doesn't uh load
that now it doesn't uh load
apparently let's see why
not no
bugs other ones load don't
they holy
he's load
right
right
H this doesn't load like a million
H this doesn't load like a million
assets or anything right Nathan did you
assets or anything right Nathan did you
like you didn't do like the pre-computed
like you didn't do like the pre-computed
path thing or something weird did
you B not
found U hold on
tactical
game didn't pre-compute anything
yet think I already have Flags in here
yet think I already have Flags in here
don't
I what happened to S stack size
isn't there like a Das s stack size or
isn't there like a Das s stack size or
something that I had to
something that I had to
upload I don't know what happened to
upload I don't know what happened to
this
I increase
the
the
wow web dev is so brain
wow web dev is so brain
dead reducing stack size to like
64kb that's
insane no wonder uh none other stuff
insane no wonder uh none other stuff
works let me see if I can just real
works let me see if I can just real
quick what's
quick what's
uh
uh
here msdk flag to increase uh stack
size d s stack
size I don't know if that's right
actually let's see if this works
want to get this thing
online I don't know what it's doing that
online I don't know what it's doing that
it's lagging like this and then
not no errors no
not no errors no
warnings got to love webd
is my tactical oh uh I didn't check that
is my tactical oh uh I didn't check that
but it should be
fine did something hacky
fine did something hacky
there we'll see what you mean by
that yeah this is your problem
yeah this this doesn't work for
yeah this this doesn't work for
web this is why it's freezing the page
web this is why it's freezing the page
good thing that you uh you caught that
good thing that you uh you caught that
though it would have taken me a while to
though it would have taken me a while to
figure that out to like realize to look
figure that out to like realize to look
at your file I I would assume that you
at your file I I would assume that you
just copi the
template oops
what do you use the Escape key
for getting out of spell
targeting does escap Auto
close you'll have to fix the keybind for
close you'll have to fix the keybind for
that
then I didn't actually know escape auto
closed oh
closed oh
jeez what's wrong with this thing
no
worries I fixed the
loop
what I fixed the loop
anything else
weird hold on let me build
this my whole machine is lowered
down cuz so here we
down cuz so here we
have like
have like
one yeah okay so we'll have to fix that
one yeah okay so we'll have to fix that
there's no way to get out of spell
targeting you didn't set the FPS
probably need to do that my
friend why the animations are so fast
friend why the animations are so fast
it's literally going as fast as the
it's literally going as fast as the
processor can
processor can
handle there you go isn't that
better lucky guess
yeah lucky
guess very cool for Nathan is his
en still
en still
no what do you mean still no
it cashing
no it's not caching it's still
no it's not caching it's still
broken message file not
broken message file not
found uh is there what assets does this
found uh is there what assets does this
thing need
thing need
Nathan oh I
Nathan oh I
know uh I think I
know uh I think I
know no asset wait no
assets might not work with set Target
assets might not work with set Target
FPS
okay oh yeah that could
be there's a couple weird things that
be there's a couple weird things that
you got to be careful about with uh with
you got to be careful about with uh with
web initialize
go there's a file not found thing which
go there's a file not found thing which
is kind of
weird uh I don't know and it's not
weird uh I don't know and it's not
telling
me console
you have a map.
you have a map.
h that should be fine oh no wait that's
h that should be fine oh no wait that's
not fine wait is it I think map. H is
not fine wait is it I think map. H is
fine I
fine I
think it's included from the same
directory well I don't actually see the
directory well I don't actually see the
file not found
file not found
here same as MOBA yeah
well I was asking cuz like the resources
well I was asking cuz like the resources
direct removed right we have this
direct removed right we have this
resources folder now where you can put
stuff hold
on o undefined
on o undefined
Behavior this is
something 809
that could be
that could be
bad hello
welcome okay this is this appears to be
welcome okay this is this appears to be
stable locally now oh no it's
stable locally now oh no it's
not what
not what
happened
happened
um hold on
set DT to one over
FPS let's try
this oh I hit QBE by mistake I've been
this oh I hit QBE by mistake I've been
playing too much League of Legends which
playing too much League of Legends which
is to say any League of
Legends all right what are the odds that
Legends all right what are the odds that
it works now I would say slim best
what's
304 has been mod has not been modified
okay well that doesn't make sense it
okay well that doesn't make sense it
should have been modified right
oh you know what I bet happening hold
on ah yep got it
my
bad still no
really now that looks good now um
uh it's very weird that we don't have
uh it's very weird that we don't have
any issues on this
any issues on this
um trying to think what else it would
be
be
huh works loow
game.om
map 200 2 megabytes is fine
let's try
this we have S assertions
on S assertions equals two we have
do we have Dash G on
here running
code message file not
found I don't know what the what was not
found I don't know what the what was not
found but something was not found oh
found but something was not found oh
that's bizarre now it works
randomly does it work without Dash
randomly does it work without Dash
G hold
on I'd be very surprised if it doesn't
on I'd be very surprised if it doesn't
work maybe then it was actually cast
caching
caching
well looks good
so once you figure out M scripton being
so once you figure out M scripton being
God
awful I mean this will be on the website
awful I mean this will be on the website
in just a couple
minutes it's at 5:29 I'm going to spend
minutes it's at 5:29 I'm going to spend
a little bit of time on the rocket M
a little bit of time on the rocket M
trying to figure some stuff out maybe
trying to figure some stuff out maybe
just making it look a little
just making it look a little
better around six I'll um
better around six I'll um
I'll get up and head over to the gym but
I'll get up and head over to the gym but
then I will jump on uh I'll jump on the
then I will jump on uh I'll jump on the
Discord for anybody that wants to ask
Discord for anybody that wants to ask
stuff or like you know get onboarded or
whatnot here's your game live on puffer
whatnot here's your game live on puffer
Dogg playable
now is that cool
let's see if I were actually trying to
let's see if I were actually trying to
play this game what would I
do I'd
do I'd
[Music]
[Music]
probably do this and then I don't
probably do this and then I don't
actually know is this a retreat
actually know is this a retreat
Arrow oh no it's just a linear
okay so if I were actually trying to
okay so if I were actually trying to
play this game this is what I would
play this game this is what I would
do but it's 2
do but it's 2
a.m. that is how I would do
it I think that's the best first move I
it I think that's the best first move I
don't
don't
know all right uh I'll be right back uh
know all right uh I'll be right back uh
I'm going to use the restroom it's been
I'm going to use the restroom it's been
another half hour or so on Rocket EnV at
another half hour or so on Rocket EnV at
least clean up Graphics of it explo
least clean up Graphics of it explo
explo yeah probably uh I'm going to
explo yeah probably uh I'm going to
spend like another half hour on Rocket M
spend like another half hour on Rocket M
I'm probably just going to fix the
I'm probably just going to fix the
graphics up on it and we'll figure out
graphics up on it and we'll figure out
Dynamics tomorrow or
Dynamics tomorrow or
whatever and
whatever and
um yeah and then I'll then I'll hop on
um yeah and then I'll then I'll hop on
Discord after that I'll be right back
Discord after that I'll be right back
they'll give me a
second

Nathan I think this is going to be
Nathan I think this is going to be
really cool um you're probably going to
really cool um you're probably going to
have to
have to
code like some sort of basic scripted Ai
code like some sort of basic scripted Ai
and then I'll have to work with you on
and then I'll have to work with you on
the action space a little bit for it um
the action space a little bit for it um
you know like maybe you can add
you know like maybe you can add
something for like hostile NPCs you know
something for like hostile NPCs you know
you can add some tofu or gobl or like
you can add some tofu or gobl or like
whatever like you know mobs um and then
whatever like you know mobs um and then
what we can do is we can just reward it
what we can do is we can just reward it
for like inflicting damage or something
for like inflicting damage or something
and I think we'll be able to get it to
and I think we'll be able to get it to
learn
something just off of that but yeah this
something just off of that but yeah this
is going to be a really cool M cuz it's
is going to be a really cool M cuz it's
an M where like the actions space is
an M where like the actions space is
kind of tricky uh and there's a lot of
kind of tricky uh and there's a lot of
potential for interesting gameplay also
potential for interesting gameplay also
this just looks
this just looks
sweet not selfplay at first we could do
sweet not selfplay at first we could do
selfplay
selfplay
um we can do selfplay if you'd like
um we can do selfplay if you'd like
to it might be harder because you can't
to it might be harder because you can't
the thing with selfplay is you can't
the thing with selfplay is you can't
have like you don't have a metric
have like you don't have a metric
anymore that's just like run a is better
anymore that's just like run a is better
than run B without doing ELO and stuff
than run B without doing ELO and stuff
we can absolutely do like V5 PVP or you
we can absolutely do like V5 PVP or you
know 8v8 PVP or whatever at some point I
know 8v8 PVP or whatever at some point I
think that it's going to be useful to
think that it's going to be useful to
have like just some really dumb scripted
have like just some really dumb scripted
things like think about like the AI in
things like think about like the AI in
doofus right like tofu or goal or
doofus right like tofu or goal or
something like that the AI is not that
something like that the AI is not that
complicated they mostly just run towards
complicated they mostly just run towards
you attack maybe they run away after
you attack maybe they run away after
stuff like
that uh I don't think so bet because if
that uh I don't think so bet because if
you use if you self buff then you can
you use if you self buff then you can
get behind an obstacle and then they
get behind an obstacle and then they
can't hit you back with the strongest
spell
H do you mind if I tweak a couple colors
H do you mind if I tweak a couple colors
Nathan if I do like the uh you know I
Nathan if I do like the uh you know I
put like the Grid in like the dark can
put like the Grid in like the dark can
and then like I convert these to be like
and then like I convert these to be like
red and can instead of red and green and
stuff I figured I'd ask permission since
stuff I figured I'd ask permission since
you put so much work into this this is
you put so much work into this this is
awesome all on the top of the dot h

is it 2 am for you now or was it 2 am
before I I can mess with stuff now if
before I I can mess with stuff now if
you want or we can set oh okay yeah no
you want or we can set oh okay yeah no
then we're not do that now uh we can
then we're not do that now uh we can
I'll set aside a block of time though
I'll set aside a block of time though
I'm very happy to just like I can hang
I'm very happy to just like I can hang
out on Discord with you in or off stream
out on Discord with you in or off stream
uh and we can just like go through and
uh and we can just like go through and
figure some stuff out on this this is
figure some stuff out on this this is
like like really this is an awesome
contribution do I know your Twitter I
contribution do I know your Twitter I
want to make sure I shout this
want to make sure I shout this
out when uh probably after I tweak a
out when uh probably after I tweak a
couple graphics and at least get you a
couple graphics and at least get you a
better
font 1 million spaces that's
funny let me fix this rocket for now
that deserves a
follow
follow
yeah this is awesome
work H you've got some good people
work H you've got some good people
following you that's funny
oh okay this is
sweet did you see the stuff on GPU drive
sweet did you see the stuff on GPU drive
or were you working on
that I probably need to fix up the
that I probably need to fix up the
puffer integration for Eugene by now
puffer integration for Eugene by now
I've been too busy coding this and
I've been too busy coding this and
working to beat Eugene to a th000
total oh yeah I saw this thing is this
total oh yeah I saw this thing is this
one that you
one that you
made oh yeah you know this did you work
made oh yeah you know this did you work
on this I don't
know yeah
okay oh you worked on knockturn I see
okay oh you worked on knockturn I see
okay
hey if you need bindings for uh this
hey if you need bindings for uh this
stuff for puffer for your actual
stuff for puffer for your actual
research I can definitely make that
research I can definitely make that
stuff
happen very cool
happen very cool
work oh okay
here very
cool well hell I was addressing you like
cool well hell I was addressing you like
you weren't a brand new to
you weren't a brand new to
RL you got already all sorts of cool
stuff that's a heck of a side project
stuff that's a heck of a side project
getting that uh that M
done yeah but you only use the doctor
done yeah but you only use the doctor
title when somebody's like being an
title when somebody's like being an
and insisting on you know being
and insisting on you know being
referred to as like
whatever that's the main use of
it respected academics doctor and
it respected academics doctor and
they'll look at you weird and tell you
they'll look at you weird and tell you
like dude I'm Joe or whatever
we're tank for
live
for e
oh get but you're oh yeah Paris yeah of
oh get but you're oh yeah Paris yeah of
course that makes sense cuz doofus
right yeah that makes total
sense
what
i l
I'm not from Paris I just I found the
I'm not from Paris I just I found the
game on mini clip when I was like 10 and
game on mini clip when I was like 10 and
got incredibly addicted to
it D what the heck was this box 2D
it D what the heck was this box 2D
include
it's really funny too because like
it's really funny too because like
literally the only games I've ever been
literally the only games I've ever been
good at are
good at are
MMOs um I don't know I did all sorts of
MMOs um I don't know I did all sorts of
crazy solo things in that and like I had
crazy solo things in that and like I had
all sorts of crazy team stuff
the darn flags for
the darn flags for
this l l box
2D
duh how long are you up to I'm going to
duh how long are you up to I'm going to
start debugging my puffer issue soon uh
start debugging my puffer issue soon uh
I'm going to just fix this for a bit and
I'm going to just fix this for a bit and
then I'm probably going to stay I'm
then I'm probably going to stay I'm
going to stay say on voice in the
going to stay say on voice in the
Discord but I'm going to go to the gym
Discord but I'm going to go to the gym
most likely and then we'll see how much
most likely and then we'll see how much
energy I have after
that hold on so okay this is already
that hold on so okay this is already
better just with the theming obviously
better just with the theming obviously
we now need to make this look like a
we now need to make this look like a
ship I actually really like like the
ship I actually really like like the
outline thing that I did earlier let me
outline thing that I did earlier let me
see how to do that
today's been a crazy good day for puffer
today's been a crazy good day for puffer
good day to be a
puffer wait so you can't why is there no
puffer wait so you can't why is there no
rectangle
rectangle
lines it also lets you do
rotation it's
annoying I mean I can just
annoying I mean I can just
like here I can just make one right
it's going to be two draw calls but I
it's going to be two draw calls but I
can do
it rectangle wreck
okay so we then we draw a rectangle
Pro kind of just want draw the lines of
Pro kind of just want draw the lines of
this don't
you I guess as long as there's nothing
you I guess as long as there's nothing
overlapping it's kind of okay
what
puffer issue is necessary to fix so that
puffer issue is necessary to fix so that
we can start Pokemon really oh okay I
we can start Pokemon really oh okay I
didn't realize that uh okay let me do
didn't realize that uh okay let me do
this real quick and I will I'll just
this real quick and I will I'll just
start on
that I thought this was like some random
that I thought this was like some random
thing that you were trying out cuz like
thing that you were trying out cuz like
I didn't think that things had changed
I didn't think that things had changed
with puffer from before right but I
with puffer from before right but I
guess they have somehow
he's setting up sweeps in Pro
he's setting up sweeps in Pro
oh
okay hold
okay hold
on let me finish this thought and then I
on let me finish this thought and then I
guess I will do that
oh this has to go up because see it's a
oh this has to go up because see it's a
little silly
I thought this was uh I thought the
I thought this was uh I thought the
error was something with resetting
M's okay there you go that's
M's okay there you go that's
like a fair bit cooler
looking we'll mess with this later
looking we'll mess with this later
what's the thing with a puffer
what's the thing with a puffer
let me
see oh very
nice we got the uh the flags for the Mac
nice we got the uh the flags for the Mac
build very good
where is this getting
where is this getting
used yo B can you can you link me like
used yo B can you can you link me like
where this is getting
where this is getting
used like when is the m getting manually
used like when is the m getting manually
reset like this
reset like this
anyways I thought that they would be
anyways I thought that they would be
getting recreated between sweeps I mean
getting recreated between sweeps I mean
between experiments on the same sweep
link me that I got one message to reply
link me that I got one message to reply
to on X I think one more potential
contributor for
wheat Branch yeah that guy I want to
wheat Branch yeah that guy I want to
know where it is that you're having to
know where it is that you're having to
do this resetting in the first
do this resetting in the first
place
place
um is he still meming me all right
um is he still meming me all right
whatever maybe shouldn't have unmuted
him refactoring plus equl
him refactoring plus equl
light uh where's your branch of this
light uh where's your branch of this
poke guess it's on the Discord hold
poke guess it's on the Discord hold
on this link thank
you this is the thing that's
erroring I'm
confused Ranch look clean puffero
all right what am I looking
at okay so you're calling this twice you
at okay so you're calling this twice you
have the the initial call at the start
have the the initial call at the start
which you want then what are you doing
which you want then what are you doing
with this
oh okay so this is the re okay I see oh
shoot so is this a
new oh because you're like making this
new oh because you're like making this
thing be your experiment
thing be your experiment
manager forcing a
manager forcing a
reset so all M's
but I'm confused because that's not
but I'm confused because that's not
actually a reset right that's like a a
actually a reset right that's like a a
simulator specific State set operation
simulator specific State set operation
isn't it like why do you have to call a
isn't it like why do you have to call a
reset to do
reset to do
this isn't it just like you send the
this isn't it just like you send the
state and then in the environments the
state and then in the environments the
individual environments are going to set
individual environments are going to set
their state
I removed the async wrappers so then
I removed the async wrappers so then
what is this
doing or I'm trying to use SQ light as a
doing or I'm trying to use SQ light as a
replacement but no you still have this Q
replacement but no you still have this Q
right this
right this
thing look at the sqlite
thing look at the sqlite
wrapper well I see that you're getting
wrapper well I see that you're getting
from the database you're getting State
from the database you're getting State
stuff right but then
in the rapper
folder two ways of creating State
folder two ways of creating State
migrations but where does this get
migrations but where does this get
called from doesn't this get this gets
called from doesn't this get this gets
called on
called on
on the individual environment level
on the individual environment level
doesn't
doesn't
it so this is called from the
subprocess so yeah then I don't
subprocess so yeah then I don't
understand why you're trying to call
understand why you're trying to call
async reset you shouldn't have to call
async reset you shouldn't have to call
the vectorized reset function you should
the vectorized reset function you should
just be able to use this thing oh
just be able to use this thing oh
because you made this a reset wrapper oh
because you made this a reset wrapper oh
um
o doesn't support put which it should
o doesn't support put which it should
it's just like I didn't bother with that
it's just like I didn't bother with that
feature because literally nobody used it
feature because literally nobody used it
so it's like why am I going to maintain
so it's like why am I going to maintain
this thing every time I screw with it if
this thing every time I screw with it if
nobody's using it
reset
reset
reset
jeez I'm trying to
jeez I'm trying to
think all right well I'll just go look
think all right well I'll just go look
at code for
at code for
you uh this might end up having to
you uh this might end up having to
be h on the puffer
box Dev
you're on 1 aren't you
you're on 1 aren't you
okay let me see if I can just eyeball
okay let me see if I can just eyeball
it and figure out what's going on
it and figure out what's going on
here let me just eyeball see if I can
here let me just eyeball see if I can
figure out what this is
so okay so what happens when we do
so we add
ah
ah
uh yo that guy um
do
do
send before you do
send before you do
this yeah no it's just for now all you
this yeah no it's just for now all you
have to do I think is you just call send
have to do I think is you just call send
before
this so you're right that that's an
oversight let me
just for
what was the other major one there was
what was the other major one there was
one other
one n cuz the other the the double thing
one n cuz the other the the double thing
is already resolved in
is already resolved in
Dev
Dev
um let me look at your code real quick
so actually this looks
fine you already called s didn't
you
you
wait am I reading this right have you
wait am I reading this right have you
called send and then you call syn
oh am I reading this right
yeah but it's weird because
like it looks to me if like if you
call wait hold
call wait hold
on cuz if you call
on cuz if you call
send then it'll
step s equals
step s equals
step what happens when you call send
step
right so what should happen
is oh
is oh
wait receive pipe. receive
well this just 197 it's just going to be
well this just 197 it's just going to be
it's just
it's just
looping because the
looping because the
semor is greater than or equal to
semor is greater than or equal to
main which means it's either in Mains or
main which means it's either in Mains or
infos
async
async
reset sends everything to
reset sends everything to
reset and then it calls send on the
reset and then it calls send on the
pipes like
pipes like
this the reset is zero
flag that doesn't make sense to
me actually should work as is um that
me actually should work as is um that
should work as is
oh
wait if
infos hang on if
infos it sets its own semaphor okay
I to write your Quick Test since this is
I to write your Quick Test since this is
important
[Music]
for
e e
hold
hold
on I got you
actually why does this not that should
actually why does this not that should
be an error right there because it
be an error right there because it
doesn't receive
H cuz it's the mixing
H cuz it's the mixing
apis yeah no that was
apis yeah no that was
correct okay so we do receive send
correct okay so we do receive send
receive send receive
receive send receive
send uh and then what do we do we
send uh and then what do we do we
do like this and we see if it breaks
do like this and we see if it breaks
does not
break well
what if I do like
what if I do like
break it still doesn't break
mhm next I'll try it async
what's this one take um num
workers batch
size there you go that's fine
num m is
num m is
30 or was it 20
30 or was it 20
40 num workers equals
40 num workers equals
2 batch size equal
20 let's see if this does
20 let's see if this does
it it's probably a a race
conditioners two bat size 20
I use my API wrong here
hold
on batch size
here didn't I do this right
40 M's two
40 M's two
workers maybe it's
workers maybe it's
this when you check for greater than
this when you check for greater than
equal to
equal to
main I don't think it's the receive
main I don't think it's the receive
pipe what I think is
happening
happening
is hold
is hold
on so what I think is happening is
this here is setting it so you're
this here is setting it so you're
calling async reset and I think that
calling async reset and I think that
while you're calling async reset the
while you're calling async reset the
worker processes are still Computing
worker processes are still Computing
stuff and they're overriding this buffer
stuff and they're overriding this buffer
I think that's the most likely
thing because this doesn't
thing because this doesn't
matter this shouldn't matter because
matter this shouldn't matter because
this is not doing a right operation this
this is not doing a right operation this
is just reading so at worst this will
is just reading so at worst this will
just make you sleep for an extra little
just make you sleep for an extra little
bit right I think that this is probably
bit right I think that this is probably
the case but I can't reproduce
the case but I can't reproduce
it I don't want to be the reason you put
it I don't want to be the reason you put
a lock well it shouldn't
need it kind of will need to have a
need it kind of will need to have a
thing on
that I can't put a lock there though is
that I can't put a lock there though is
the thing uh if you put a lock you kill
the thing uh if you put a lock you kill
the entire perf of puffer
the entire perf of puffer
so you're going to have to just there's
so you're going to have to just there's
going to have to just be like a clear
going to have to just be like a clear
function or
something literally like the lock will
something literally like the lock will
add 40 uh 40 micros seconds which is
add 40 uh 40 micros seconds which is
more it's like twice the overhead of
more it's like twice the overhead of
this entire
this entire
thing so you like triple your
overhead am I doing something stupid
overhead am I doing something stupid
here why is this not why does this not
here why is this not why does this not
run why does my own API not
work num
work num
workers bad
size there's no way to check that it's
safe that's not a thing you can do
safe that's not a thing you can do
without a
lock I think if you just call
receive we have to receive from
receive we have to receive from
everything though
okay you can't do that
okay you can't do that
um you can't do that because in between
um you can't do that because in between
the check and its setting it can still
the check and its setting it can still
happen you're describing the exact use
happen you're describing the exact use
case for a semaphor but the semaphor is
case for a semaphor but the semaphor is
too
too
slow that's why we have an array called
slow that's why we have an array called
sem
sem
that's like not really a
semor why does this stupid thing not
semor why does this stupid thing not
work am I just being dumb like
have I've been coding for too long on my
have I've been coding for too long on my
own API or is the API
own API or is the API
bad I think it is bad because they
bad I think it is bad because they
should not be able to error like
should not be able to error like
that N
that N
quars M's
quars M's
workers and workers batch size back end
oh wait this is the new Branch so
probably for
and
cereal I think I probably broke
cereal I think I probably broke
something with the new
something with the new
multiprocess I broke something here
I broke something
oh wait did
oh wait did
I no I passed it here is native
sh
e e
21 damn
it
it
01 the heck is happening here
oh hold
on star

seven viewers on
seven viewers on
Twitch yeah Star Puffer for
Twitch yeah Star Puffer for
sure more Dev daily and often cooler
sure more Dev daily and often cooler
stuff than this
stuff than this
debugging though this is this is
debugging though this is this is
important unfortunately
well that's is
weird well the debugging is also kind of
gross why is it why do we get a zero in
gross why is it why do we get a zero in
here
1 one 105 and 80 right
wait numb
workers how's this come
in
oh that's bizarre
are not this
cuz oh yeah CU you get worker index
here I mean this is a separate problem
here I mean this is a separate problem
problem though is the problem
um let me just real
quick we got get clone time down for
I'm going to try this real quick if this
I'm going to try this real quick if this
works I'm going to ship it if not I'm
works I'm going to ship it if not I'm
going to give you what I think is
going to give you what I think is
happening and then go to the gym because
happening and then go to the gym because
I'm getting hungry here and I've been
I'm getting hungry here and I've been
working on this all
working on this all
day um but I think I might have an idea
dude what the hell is wrong with this
dude what the hell is wrong with this
pip
pip
install
s did JY update with more
are you kidding
me dude it's like actually so hard to
me dude it's like actually so hard to
stay ahead of what these P people
do oh wait hold on
okay no I just improved it in 1.1 that's
okay no I just improved it in 1.1 that's
one that's
fine okay so M send receive send
fine okay so M send receive send
receive
receive
async
reset um I can't Repro this man
yeah it's not getting
yeah it's not getting
stuck um you see it's not
oh hold
on that might be
on that might be
it I think we got
it I think we got
it I think that's the Repro right there
it I think that's the Repro right there
right that's the race
condition okay I Repro
it it's non- deterministic obviously
it it's non- deterministic obviously
because it's a freaking race condition
15 can't
yes that's an obnoxious
one
for for
oops wrong one
you might actually get a rare 1 commit
you might actually get a rare 1 commit
right now it's not going to pip I'll
right now it's not going to pip I'll
tell you
tell you
that but I will actually make it to 10
that but I will actually make it to 10
for
you really that flush doesn't
work that's bizarre it should work
oh
otherwise silly me
that wasn't that
that wasn't that
bad little race
bad little race
condition just a little race
condition what was the solution I was
condition what was the solution I was
looking away um you're not allowed to to
looking away um you're not allowed to to
just continually receive until you clear
just continually receive until you clear
the buffer so I had to add a flush
the buffer so I had to add a flush
method that just waits for all the
method that just waits for all the
workers to be um to be
done should be compatible with
done should be compatible with
everything as
well manually call the flush yeah you'll
well manually call the flush yeah you'll
have to call the flush before you call
have to call the flush before you call
async reset but that's no big deal is it
I mean I can add it to Cal as well if
I mean I can add it to Cal as well if
you just want to pass
through you want
that
stable there's no way to build it into
stable there's no way to build it into
um oh I see what you mean uh
um oh I see what you mean uh
actually I might be able to do
actually I might be able to do
that hold on I might be able to do that
that hold on I might be able to do that
for you I didn't think of it
yeah no it's fine I don't I don't care
yeah no it's fine I don't I don't care
about that
sh
yeah good
call
call
O suppos not oh cuz I don't have to call
O suppos not oh cuz I don't have to call
flush anymore
I am hungry and still have two bench

anything all right there's your PR I
anything all right there's your PR I
mean there's your your fix that guy no
mean there's your your fix that guy no

programming C so yeah I will link
programming C so yeah I will link
that

uffer also please St the repository I'll
uffer also please St the repository I'll
be over there in the voice in general in
be over there in the voice in general in
just a few minutes so don't be shy come
just a few minutes so don't be shy come
and say hi thanks all see you

Kind: captions
Language: en
okay we are
alive are let me
see
oops we got some stuff to do today uh
oops we got some stuff to do today uh
first of
first of
all I realized like the Mev just hasn't
all I realized like the Mev just hasn't
been going fast enough I really needed
been going fast enough I really needed
to be doing more on the promo side to
to be doing more on the promo side to
get more people interested in
get more people interested in
contributing because they're just simply
contributing because they're just simply
too many environments and that went very
too many environments and that went very
very well this morning we got a whole
very well this morning we got a whole
bunch of DMS from new people who are
bunch of DMS from new people who are
looking to contribute to stuff which is
looking to contribute to stuff which is
awesome um so if you're one of those and
awesome um so if you're one of those and
watching this then I'm happy to get you
watching this then I'm happy to get you
set up right
set up right
now uh in the meantime though I'm going
now uh in the meantime though I'm going
to start going over PRS and such
to start going over PRS and such
from contributors I think we have one
got one here
whoops where is
it some aray
I'm going to have to merge uh the
I'm going to have to merge uh the
breakout fixes I think um let me
breakout fixes I think um let me
see obvious standouts at the moment
let me see
let me see what else what else can I get
let me see what else what else can I get
people to do
we'll try and what else do we haveg
crunch time
okay so that's some good stuff to start
okay so that's some good stuff to start
with
with
there
um that's some good stuff to start with
um that's some good stuff to start with
there
[Music]
very
very
good let's get the uh this PR
good let's get the uh this PR
here
here
so large refactor
so large refactor
to
to
[Music]
[Music]
use
bitboard 49
bitboard 49
bits okay that's
interesting this is
interesting this is
clever yeah this is clever this is more
clever yeah this is clever this is more
than I would expect from a lot of new
than I would expect from a lot of new
contributors actually this is good good
contributors actually this is good good
work if he actually did
this this is nice Oh Hey
this this is nice Oh Hey
Jake if you actually implemented this
Jake if you actually implemented this
type of stuff well done this is more
type of stuff well done this is more
than I expect from uh a lot of
than I expect from uh a lot of
contributors that's
contributors that's
uh this is cool actually doing some mask
stuff what did this guy do this guy did
stuff what did this guy do this guy did
it in
it in
uh
uh
solver this SM C++
Shenanigans yeah so I'm assuming that
Shenanigans yeah so I'm assuming that
your implementation will actually be a
your implementation will actually be a
lot simpler than this stuff here
Tech debt to some
Tech debt to some
degree I think it's technical debt to
degree I think it's technical debt to
some degree not sure the tradeoff is
some degree not sure the tradeoff is
good enough um well it depends on let's
good enough um well it depends on let's
let's look at the code here
so yeah this is just so it's all in
here I mean I don't mind lowlevel stuff
here I mean I don't mind lowlevel stuff
like this it's actually fine what I mind
like this it's actually fine what I mind
is generally abstraction and structure
is generally abstraction and structure
sure
sure
um having like a file that's 350 lines
um having like a file that's 350 lines
for Connect 4 is good like what I mind
for Connect 4 is good like what I mind
is when you get just like tons of layers
is when you get just like tons of layers
of that like you can't just
of that like you can't just
read the code top to
read the code top to
bottom I still don't know what I want to
bottom I still don't know what I want to
do with these log buffers cuz
do with these log buffers cuz
like I kind of like that it's just
like I kind of like that it's just
separate per file like this um but it
separate per file like this um but it
does mean you have to paste in 50 lines
does mean you have to paste in 50 lines
at the
at the
top the way I just ified this in my head
top the way I just ified this in my head
was like so there is an include of
was like so there is an include of
puffer net. but that include is only for
puffer net. but that include is only for
uh the compiled demo right so when you
uh the compiled demo right so when you
come when you use the scon code uh it's
come when you use the scon code uh it's
just binding theh so it has no
just binding theh so it has no
dependencies that's how I Justified this
dependencies that's how I Justified this
layout in my
layout in my
head okay we got connect
head okay we got connect
for
for
position mask
obervations this is
good
Char
okay uh you don't need to make um you
okay uh you don't need to make um you
don't need to make methods like this uh
don't need to make methods like this uh
if they're going to be empty there
if they're going to be empty there
there's not like an actual API it's the
there's not like an actual API it's the
way to think about this is It's a
way to think about this is It's a
convention not a not an API right so
convention not a not an API right so
what I do is I make an init method that
what I do is I make an init method that
gets called um from like the C file if
gets called um from like the C file if
needed right in order to do any setup or
needed right in order to do any setup or
no other way around it's called from
no other way around it's called from
scyon to do any setup if needed and then
scyon to do any setup if needed and then
the allocate method it's because you
the allocate method it's because you
need these extra buffers if you're going
need these extra buffers if you're going
to use it from purec so I just use a
to use it from purec so I just use a
knit and allocate as conventions and I
knit and allocate as conventions and I
also I'll use like make if it returns an
also I'll use like make if it returns an
object
object
but it's just it's a convention it's not
but it's just it's a convention it's not
an API so you don't ever need to feel
an API so you don't ever need to feel
obligated to put like empty methods for
stuff from syon as well yeah well I I
stuff from syon as well yeah well I I
mean you can if you want if you're able
mean you can if you want if you're able
to do that right now and just update it
to do that right now and just update it
then you can do that otherwise I'll just
then you can do that otherwise I'll just
do it when I pull it in right I mean I'm
do it when I pull it in right I mean I'm
not just a merge button I'm able to edit
not just a merge button I'm able to edit
code myself too
okay this is
good top
good top
mask bottom
mask top
mask what is this
oh it's going to
be the
top check if the last cell is
top check if the last cell is
free okay so this is the top mask
yeah I understand
and then the bottom
and then the bottom
mask I don't know what you use this for
mask I don't know what you use this for
but
but
sure and then
bottom I actually don't understand what
bottom I actually don't understand what
these masks are for uh we'll see so
these masks are for uh we'll see so
valid
move you can probably actually inline
move you can probably actually inline
some of these as well I don't know if
some of these as well I don't know if
that'll matter valid
that'll matter valid
move mask and top mask equals

the board is full so I don't like to
comment stuff very often like I'm pretty
comment stuff very often like I'm pretty
sparse on comments usually but stuff
sparse on comments usually but stuff
like this where it's like bit
like this where it's like bit
logic um this could definitely use a
logic um this could definitely use a
couple like I get what the top mask is
couple like I get what the top mask is
for I don't necessarily get why there's
for I don't necessarily get why there's
a bottom mask and stuff I get I can
a bottom mask and stuff I get I can
figure out that this is this is the full
figure out that this is this is the full

judicious naming when you have lowl

stuff like this would be nice this is

overall though this is very nice and

readable like this is so far I'm fine

with

if okay I see that this is these are

checks I have no idea how these work but
checks I have no idea how these work but
uh yeah this is going to be I imagine
uh yeah this is going to be I imagine
that this is a clever bit of stuff
that this is a clever bit of stuff
designed in this post with bit masking

cool reviewing it cringing no you're
cool reviewing it cringing no you're
actually this code is pretty darn good
actually this code is pretty darn good
honestly um like stuff like this like if
honestly um like stuff like this like if
you want to you could just name this
you want to you could just name this
like board full or something and it
like board full or something and it
wouldn't even need a comment right
um but yeah I don't I don't actually
um but yeah I don't I don't actually
like code that's like super heavily
like code that's like super heavily
commented stuff should usually be self
commented stuff should usually be self
explanatory it's basically only when you
explanatory it's basically only when you
have stuff that's like clever bit math
have stuff that's like clever bit math
or something like this where you should
or something like this where you should
need like a couple very short things
need like a couple very short things
like I just don't understand for

instance like okay I can figure out this

top mask this is like this is like a
top mask this is like this is like a
floating mask at the top
floating mask at the top
of I think that this is a floating mask
of I think that this is a floating mask
for like where you've played the top
for like where you've played the top
cell I think or no wait it's just the

top the top row
top the top row
yeah so there's some details where it's
yeah so there's some details where it's
like it's hard to just read from the bit
like it's hard to just read from the bit
math cuz this is like clever stuff that
math cuz this is like clever stuff that
you have to kind of unpack right this
you have to kind of unpack right this
isn't like normal

code minmax is
fine yeah yeah everybody should know

what Mini Max is you don't have to go
what Mini Max is you don't have to go

depth and then is this recursive let's
see this type of thing is fine I'd
see this type of thing is fine I'd
probably use a Turner for stuff like
probably use a Turner for stuff like
this but that's a total nitpick has

onboarding finished nope I'm uh I am
onboarding finished nope I'm uh I am
here all day to onboard people and to
here all day to onboard people and to
answer questions and stuff I'm currently
answer questions and stuff I'm currently
taking a let me like finish reviewing
taking a let me like finish reviewing
this code bit but if you want uh if you
this code bit but if you want uh if you
want some input on how to get started
want some input on how to get started
and what might be a good spot that's
and what might be a good spot that's
what I'm here for the goal for today is
what I'm here for the goal for today is
to like merge some code get some people
to like merge some code get some people
up to speed and work on a couple M
up to speed and work on a couple M
things

myself without the disc count it stops

trying

early uh
early uh
interesting
so it has been seven or eight years
so it has been seven or eight years
since I've seen min max explicitly done
since I've seen min max explicitly done
let me see
one yeah I have some very minor
one yeah I have some very minor
alterations to some code I don't know uh
alterations to some code I don't know uh
I don't know Jake if it would be helpful
I don't know Jake if it would be helpful
for once you submit that if it would be
for once you submit that if it would be
helpful for you to watch me refactor a
helpful for you to watch me refactor a
couple small things live um I think
couple small things live um I think
generally your code is very good here I
generally your code is very good here I
have like a couple small nitpicks with
have like a couple small nitpicks with
things but this is is overall this is
things but this is is overall this is
well above the bar for puffer this is
well above the bar for puffer this is
well above the bar there are a few
well above the bar there are a few
things that can be improved just a
things that can be improved just a
little bit um but I'm very much
nitpicking also I'm realizing that we're
nitpicking also I'm realizing that we're
probably going to horrify some people
probably going to horrify some people
watching this you do not have to know
watching this you do not have to know
how to do a bunch of bit math and Logic
how to do a bunch of bit math and Logic
for most of the environments this is a
for most of the environments this is a
special case most of the things will not
special case most of the things will not
be like
be like
this if it's going to lose in three
this if it's going to lose in three
steps it treats the first and second
steps it treats the first and second
step as lost I'll put some changes and
step as lost I'll put some changes and
then you can go wild yeah perfect okay
then you can go wild yeah perfect okay
that's interesting I'd have to look at
that's interesting I'd have to look at
the algorithm for that so it's not valid
the algorithm for that so it's not valid
move continue yep
move continue yep
perfect uh this is and position and mask
play God I'm going to actually I have to
play God I'm going to actually I have to
look at this let me see how do this mmax
look at this let me see how do this mmax
work
so I assume that you start at a positive
so I assume that you start at a positive
depth and then if it's zero or You've
depth and then if it's zero or You've
Won or you've
draw you turn
draw you turn
okay yeah there's some stuff I can fix
okay yeah there's some stuff I can fix
here but then you would
here but then you would
return a value on the mid Max
okay
okay
and value of
game Max minus
max if it's not a valid
max if it's not a valid
move
move
okay and then what do we
okay and then what do we
do child
do child
position child mask play
oh that's funny because the whole board
oh that's funny because the whole board
state is just a a 64
okay well we're not going to be able to
okay well we're not going to be able to
easily turn this game into like connect
easily turn this game into like connect
end because of this but that's kind of
end because of this but that's kind of
fine we don't really need every
fine we don't really need every
environment to be super configurable and
environment to be super configurable and
I think I would rather just have uh
I think I would rather just have uh
Connect 4 B just Connect 4 and be fast
Connect 4 B just Connect 4 and be fast
so I'm happy with this this is fine um
so I'm happy with this this is fine um
uh child
value min
value min
max this is good position and mask swaps
max this is good position and mask swaps
the
player that wait no that's not and
player that wait no that's not and
that's uh is that
that's uh is that
exor I forget I think that's exor right
yeah okay it's been a long time since
yeah okay it's been a long time since
I've done bit level
stuff maximizing player and child
stuff maximizing player and child
value values child value
value values child value
okay
okay
wait how's this
wait how's this
work if not maximizing
player yeah xor
okay if maximize
player oh okay I see I see what this
player oh okay I see I see what this
is yeah so you have to
is yeah so you have to
basically see if
basically see if
like yeah because the score gets flipped
like yeah because the score gets flipped
okay I
okay I
see compute and
see compute and
move hardcoded opening book really
huh that's
funky I couldn't find Min and Max and
funky I couldn't find Min and Max and
C uh it's F it's F Max F or like it's
C uh it's F it's F Max F or like it's
type dependent so there's a different
type dependent so there's a different
signature depending on the type
signature depending on the type
I think it's it's either I forget if
I think it's it's either I forget if
it's output type Max input type or input
it's output type Max input type or input
Max output type but like you have like f
Max output type but like you have like f
Max F and like IMAX I and stuff like
Max F and like IMAX I and stuff like
that I
that I
think single move to opening book okay
think single move to opening book okay
that's fine we'll see how we train
that's fine we'll see how we train
against it right if we demolish this
against it right if we demolish this
thing then we'll try to make it harder
uh don't do this type of inline thing
I know that I did it uh a couple times
I know that I did it uh a couple times
in the Moa it was a
mistake child
mistake child
position child
mask
okay break ties randomly
Implement a heuristic for non-terminal
states without it you got some
states without it you got some
exploitable
openings there might be something with
openings there might be something with
seeding Jake um I noticed I think it was
seeding Jake um I noticed I think it was
always doing the same
always doing the same
move I think that there probably needs
move I think that there probably needs
to be either like a symmetry break or a
to be either like a symmetry break or a
seaing or something cuz I think right
seaing or something cuz I think right
now it'll just it'll take the first move
now it'll just it'll take the first move
or whatever that is a specific value
or whatever that is a specific value
probably there should be like if the
probably there should be like if the
values are equal right of multiple moves
values are equal right of multiple moves
it should like have a chance to switch
it should like have a chance to switch
to the new one or something maybe
to the new one or something maybe
symmetry breaking is kind of important
symmetry breaking is kind of important
cuz otherwise yeah you'll learn like
cuz otherwise yeah you'll learn like
deterministic policies that just wreck
it I'm not going to say that I fully
it I'm not going to say that I fully
understand everything here because
understand everything here because
obviously there's some lowlevel logic
obviously there's some lowlevel logic
and there's like some
and there's like some
stuff going on but I will say that the
stuff going on but I will say that the
code looks mostly quite clean with a
code looks mostly quite clean with a
couple very small nitpicks um we will
couple very small nitpicks um we will
we'll get this set up I
think let let me see
step okay this is the
same
um random
and single hardcoded seems enough
and single hardcoded seems enough
okay input player
action I assume there was something that
action I assume there was something that
used to be here
valid
move I'm not going to blame you for
move I'm not going to blame you for
stuff like this I do this all the time
stuff like this I do this all the time
right it's like you spend long enough on
right it's like you spend long enough on
something um and then you kind of just
something um and then you kind of just
stop seeing stuff until you go look at
stop seeing stuff until you go look at
it again
fresh I ship a bunch of dumb stuff all
fresh I ship a bunch of dumb stuff all
the
the
time I'm not going to I'm not going to
time I'm not going to I'm not going to
nitpick you on stuff like this cuz like
nitpick you on stuff like this cuz like
I know that you know that this is silly
I know that you know that this is silly
right the only things I'm going to
right the only things I'm going to
nitpick are things where it's like H you
nitpick are things where it's like H you
might not know that this is
might not know that this is
silly I was looking at whether I don't I
silly I was looking at whether I don't I
like this nesting pattern uh I think
like this nesting pattern uh I think
that this is probably fine the way that
that this is probably fine the way that
this is nested you could restructure it
this is nested you could restructure it
but I think I don't really think that
but I think I don't really think that
you need to
okay this is a little bit
okay this is a little bit
silly uh
silly uh
actually wait
if uh actually this is kind of
if uh actually this is kind of
okay cuz there's this else that's I
okay cuz there's this else that's I
would have like rever like flipped this
would have like rever like flipped this
if not valid move or whatever but yeah I
if not valid move or whatever but yeah I
think this is fine I might I might tweak
think this is fine I might I might tweak
a couple small
a couple small
things and then rendering is about the
things and then rendering is about the
same rendering is about the
same 400 not bad at
same 400 not bad at
all I think uh we clean this up we'll
all I think uh we clean this up we'll
get it to be probably under 400
get it to be probably under 400
total with a little bit of cleanup
total with a little bit of cleanup
including logging and everything and
including logging and everything and
this is a very nice Standalone
this is a very nice Standalone
environment and we'll have a board game
environment and we'll have a board game
for Connect
4 what do you
4 what do you
think of storage
huh I'm not sure of uh I'm not sure of
huh I'm not sure of uh I'm not sure of
the question
here is this somebody telling me that I
here is this somebody telling me that I
messed up and that my is easy to
hack oh no no no this is
C no you're good I thought that I
C no you're good I thought that I
thought you were somebody I thought you
thought you were somebody I thought you
were telling me like hey your website's
were telling me like hey your website's
garbage and I can hack it or something
garbage and I can hack it or something
like hey you're storing your access
like hey you're storing your access
token stupid no so this is um these are
token stupid no so this is um these are
environments that we have here these are
environments that we have here these are
all written in pure C and then they're
all written in pure C and then they're
compiled uh to web assembly with M
compiled uh to web assembly with M
script in so they're super super fast
script in so they're super super fast
and then the graphics for them are in
and then the graphics for them are in
rib rib is also in C so it builds to web
rib rib is also in C so it builds to web
assembly um so yeah like the actual
assembly um so yeah like the actual
front end for this is just like
front end for this is just like
index.html all this stuff is
C and ironically I actually think that
C and ironically I actually think that
that is easier than writing
that is easier than writing
JavaScript has the benefit of being very
JavaScript has the benefit of being very
fast as
[Music]
well yeah the only reason this is at all
well yeah the only reason this is at all
complicated is because of all this fancy
complicated is because of all this fancy
bit logic to go fast but this is good I
bit logic to go fast but this is good I
aspire to be this level of good okay
aspire to be this level of good okay
what if I told you that I hadn't written
what if I told you that I hadn't written
C in 10 years until 3 months
C in 10 years until 3 months
ago and then directly following that I
ago and then directly following that I
wrote this in like I don't know a few
wrote this in like I don't know a few
weeks you can kind of just learn
stuff you just got to do
stuff you just got to do
it hey this is an open source project
it hey this is an open source project
all the stuff we're doing here is open
all the stuff we're doing here is open

contributors
today welcome back awesome hey naan
today welcome back awesome hey naan
Ethan where's the guy that was asking
Ethan where's the guy that was asking
about onboarding
about onboarding
um there was a guy on Twitch that was
um there was a guy on Twitch that was
asking about onboarding if you're still
asking about onboarding if you're still
here and have questions or stuff to get
here and have questions or stuff to get
on to I'd be happy to answer stuff while
on to I'd be happy to answer stuff while
Jake is uh fixing up this PR but yeah
Jake is uh fixing up this PR but yeah
basically I posted a ton of stuff on uh
basically I posted a ton of stuff on uh
on X today like hey we need more
on X today like hey we need more
contributors cuz these M's aren't going
contributors cuz these M's aren't going
fast enough and we really like I can
fast enough and we really like I can
only write so much code myself um so
only write so much code myself um so
really the goal for the next release of
really the goal for the next release of
Li is we want to have at least 10 high
Li is we want to have at least 10 high
quality game environments or other types
quality game environments or other types
of environments varying complexity
of environments varying complexity
varying type and so on and really it's
varying type and so on and really it's
not any harder than just writing the
not any harder than just writing the
games as you would normally you don't
games as you would normally you don't
really need to know the RL side very
really need to know the RL side very
well at all in order to be productive
well at all in order to be productive
here and I can help in those areas so
here and I can help in those areas so
this is just a really great area where
this is just a really great area where
if you know how to write decent code you
if you know how to write decent code you
can help completely transform a branch
can help completely transform a branch
of science
of science
um that is the goal for
um that is the goal for
puffer hey Joseph new to puffer going to
puffer hey Joseph new to puffer going to
be digging into it a lot for production
be digging into it a lot for production
stuff not just games yeah and this is
stuff not just games yeah and this is
not just for games either like we use
not just for games either like we use
games because they're really good test
games because they're really good test
cases for reinforcement learning and
cases for reinforcement learning and
they cover a lot of ground they're
they cover a lot of ground they're
relatively easy to implement uh they're

they're very good for testing out
they're very good for testing out
algorithms quickly uh we are going to

in fact puffer does have a like there is
in fact puffer does have a like there is
a a company behind puffer all the stuff
a a company behind puffer all the stuff
is free and open source uh but
is free and open source uh but
technically you can pay for like
technically you can pay for like
extended support and stuff like that and
extended support and stuff like that and
that doesn't just apply to
games but for the most part the goal is
games but for the most part the goal is
open source science and research first
open source science and research first
and
and
foremost you got any funding for puffer
foremost you got any funding for puffer
throw up some bounties and I'm happy to
throw up some bounties and I'm happy to
swap over got a crank out to make rent
swap over got a crank out to make rent
trying to write Russ and no rust yeah so
trying to write Russ and no rust yeah so
uh I will I've been very public about
uh I will I've been very public about
this there will be bounties as soon as
this there will be bounties as soon as
puffer has Revenue I just opened up
puffer has Revenue I just opened up
puffer to potential business like a
puffer to potential business like a
month ago and the business model for
month ago and the business model for
puffer is literally just you can pay for
puffer is literally just you can pay for
priority features let's say that you're
priority features let's say that you're
working on something in industry and you
working on something in industry and you
need puffer to be able to support
need puffer to be able to support
something in order for you to be able to

do that well or you need some eyes some
do that well or you need some eyes some
experienced R Allis on your problem

or you need just like extended support
or you need just like extended support
that is what puffer sells uh so as soon
that is what puffer sells uh so as soon
as I start actually doing that business
as I start actually doing that business
side of work and getting a couple of
side of work and getting a couple of
clients I will put the revenue from that
clients I will put the revenue from that
all directly back into feature bounties
all directly back into feature bounties

money on this but for the short term my
goal is to just accelerate this as an

I don't know yikes like one of
I don't know yikes like one of
the one of the really cool things with
the one of the really cool things with
reinforcement learning is that you have
reinforcement learning is that you have
unlimited data um and as soon as you put
unlimited data um and as soon as you put
an R uh an llm in the loop like the llm
an R uh an llm in the loop like the llm
is so slow that you can't take advantage
is so slow that you can't take advantage
of that unlimited data so I think that
of that unlimited data so I think that
llms are going to have a huge role to
llms are going to have a huge role to
play but I think it's going to be more
play but I think it's going to be more
like you call an llm very infrequently

pretty big bottleneck yeah so the main
pretty big bottleneck yeah so the main

end of the month though to do some
maintenance I guess in the meantime I
maintenance I guess in the meantime I
can start on this other project um
here let me open up the
shell for new contributors we have a uh
shell for new contributors we have a uh
a very nice just pre-built container
a very nice just pre-built container
that has puffer and everything set up in
that has puffer and everything set up in
it you don't have to use it but it's
convenient oh perfect timing
I will then I'm just going to merge your
I will then I'm just going to merge your
thing and then we'll make edits locally
thing and then we'll make edits locally
if that sounds
good
PR new changes
okay
okay
so going to go back to
this oh actually there's another thing
this oh actually there's another thing
since we have a bunch of people watching
since we have a bunch of people watching
that I haven't had the time to figure
that I haven't had the time to figure
out yet I don't know if anybody has webd
out yet I don't know if anybody has webd
experience with this um but right now we
experience with this um but right now we
build all of these environments with M
build all of these environments with M
scripton individually and then we like
scripton individually and then we like
link them onto uh the main page I would
link them onto uh the main page I would
like to have it so that we can just have
like to have it so that we can just have
one m script and build for everything
one m script and build for everything
and we can put all the environments on
and we can put all the environments on
the main page in like a two column
the main page in like a two column
format so you have like environment on
format so you have like environment on
one side and then information about the
one side and then information about the
environment on the right side and have
environment on the right side and have
like you know who made the environment
like you know who made the environment
how to control the environment stuff

this curious why ocean M header files
this curious why ocean M header files
have so much implementation versus
have so much implementation versus
putting that in the C file so theh files
putting that in the C file so theh files
get included from python we just include
get included from python we just include
theh as a standalone and then the C file
theh as a standalone and then the C file
is for uh just the pure C demo that
is for uh just the pure C demo that
doesn't run through python so if you can
doesn't run through python so if you can
build these environments just in C and
build these environments just in C and
run them in C and build them for web and
run them in C and build them for web and
put that on the web that's what the
put that on the web that's what the
little C file is the whole environment
little C file is the whole environment
logic is just in that. h and that gets
logic is just in that. h and that gets
included very easily from
scon it's like a header only setup kind
scon it's like a header only setup kind

[Music]
um yeah so I've tried to make it very
um yeah so I've tried to make it very
easy
easy
um try to make it very easy for people
um try to make it very easy for people
just like the single file format per N I
just like the single file format per N I
got rid of a lot of the old build script
got rid of a lot of the old build script
stuff that was a pain I replaced it with
stuff that was a pain I replaced it with
something
simpler let's go check out uh Connect
4 this is by Spencer and then refactored
4 this is by Spencer and then refactored
and rebuilt uh re architected I should
and rebuilt uh re architected I should
say by Jake
here does this have the perf test in it
here does this have the perf test in it
no it
doesn't hold on let me go grab the perf
doesn't hold on let me go grab the perf
test code that I just
test code that I just
deleted with this merge
for
for
how I just TP to
how I just TP to
that
what I am confused
are you on the right stream are you uh
are you on the right stream are you uh
are you typing in the right chat
here not sure what's going
on H whatever I'll just redo the perf
on H whatever I'll just redo the perf
test code real quick this is simple
test code real quick this is simple
that's a new uh that's a new Max total
that's a new uh that's a new Max total

where I can want to learn no limited
where I can want to learn no limited
about RL that's totally fine honestly
about RL that's totally fine honestly
the hard part is getting all the M's
the hard part is getting all the M's
built correctly and built fast if
built correctly and built fast if
I oh lots of
people whoa this is cool
people whoa this is cool
is this in
C wait what is this
in got three the other
in got three the other
day what is this written
in what are these blocks that are
like wait what is this written in
oh I think it's j yeah it's well is the
oh I think it's j yeah it's well is the
logic in JavaScript or is it just the
logic in JavaScript or is it just the
front
front
end uh so one of the tricky things with
end uh so one of the tricky things with
uh RL is you need the state logic to be
uh RL is you need the state logic to be
separate from the rendering and the
separate from the rendering and the
state logic has to be fast so 3D stuff
state logic has to be fast so 3D stuff
is good we actually we want more 3D
is good we actually we want more 3D
stuff but um we need the logic to be f F
stuff but um we need the logic to be f F
that doesn't mean it has to be in C but
that doesn't mean it has to be in C but
it does have to be in like something low
it does have to be in like something low
level just answer some stuff here
[Music]
[Music]
I I think there were a couple other
people it's pretty awesome to see the
people it's pretty awesome to see the
number of people interested in this
do you have a link to reading on the
do you have a link to reading on the
state portion might be able to structure
state portion might be able to structure
the code still learn uh still learning
the code still learn uh still learning
send reading uh honestly the easiest
send reading uh honestly the easiest
thing for you is going to be to look at
thing for you is going to be to look at
some of our existing environment code
some of our existing environment code
like they're pretty self-contained as
like they're pretty self-contained as
tests and uh they're pretty short as
tests and uh they're pretty short as
well
where's
where's
ocean so right here in Ocean in
Dev like let's see which is one of these
Dev like let's see which is one of these
that's pretty stable Hong is pretty
that's pretty stable Hong is pretty
stable so if you just look at this link
stable so if you just look at this link
here like the whole Logic for this thing
here like the whole Logic for this thing
is like 300 lines of c um it doesn't
is like 300 lines of c um it doesn't
have to be see like I said but it's just
have to be see like I said but it's just
a very simple procedural game where all
a very simple procedural game where all
the logic this is all the state for pong
the logic this is all the state for pong
and then at the bottom here you see that
and then at the bottom here you see that
the client is separate so you make the
the client is separate so you make the
client completely separately from the
client completely separately from the
game State meaning that you can run the
game State meaning that you can run the
game headless without having to render
game headless without having to render
and then we do our rendering in um we do
and then we do our rendering in um we do
our rendering typically in RB not
our rendering typically in RB not
required if you want to figure out how
required if you want to figure out how
to do like a 3js front end for a 3D
to do like a 3js front end for a 3D
thing that's totally fine the main
thing that's totally fine the main
important thing is that you have a fast
important thing is that you have a fast
uh fast State simulation
let me answer this guy real quick and
let me answer this guy real quick and
then we will uh we'll merge in The
then we will uh we'll merge in The
Connect Four stuff we'll fix that we'll
Connect Four stuff we'll fix that we'll
perf test it and so on
I'm question how exactly does
I'm question how exactly does
compatibility work between C and python
compatibility work between C and python
dumb questions are fine uh look so this
dumb questions are fine uh look so this
is it's not hard and puffer's done a lot
is it's not hard and puffer's done a lot
of the work for you there
of the work for you there
so this this is connect 4. Pi little
so this this is connect 4. Pi little
tiny file right this is the whole class
tiny file right this is the whole class
that you're seeing right here this is it
that you're seeing right here this is it
this is your python binding and you can
this is your python binding and you can
see that it adds this SC Connect 4 thing
see that it adds this SC Connect 4 thing
here and then SC Connect 4 you have a
here and then SC Connect 4 you have a
little piece of scon code that is the
little piece of scon code that is the
intermediate layer between Python and C
intermediate layer between Python and C
it also does this Loop over many
it also does this Loop over many
instances of the environment so it makes
instances of the environment so it makes
it very easy to efficiently run a whole
it very easy to efficiently run a whole
bunch of different instances of of the
bunch of different instances of of the
environment uh on one lowlevel process
environment uh on one lowlevel process
without having to go back to python
without having to go back to python
every time so this is all that's in here
every time so this is all that's in here
very simple class the thing that is at
very simple class the thing that is at
the top this is just header stuff
the top this is just header stuff
imported from
imported from
C and then after that literally you
C and then after that literally you
don't have to think about it because
don't have to think about it because
you're just writing you know lowl
you're just writing you know lowl
procedural code here for the actual
procedural code here for the actual
simulation
itself and this works with everything
itself and this works with everything
like this will work for multi-agent M
like this will work for multi-agent M
this works for all sorts of different
this works for all sorts of different
data types very very simple to add
data types very very simple to add
bindings uh this is one of the things I
bindings uh this is one of the things I
put a lot of effort into making clean
put a lot of effort into making clean
and simple with
and simple with
puffer is the way that we handle these
puffer is the way that we handle these
things we also we make it so that you
things we also we make it so that you
can build the environment as a
can build the environment as a
standalone Inc as well so that you can
standalone Inc as well so that you can
Dev stuff in pure C without having to go
Dev stuff in pure C without having to go
through the really obnoxiously long like
through the really obnoxiously long like
Python compile and build tools and all
Python compile and build tools and all
that that way you can just like focus on
that that way you can just like focus on
building a low-l procedural game or
building a low-l procedural game or
whatever and then The Binding thing is
whatever and then The Binding thing is
like on top of it in separate um and is
like on top of it in separate um and is
you know there not really very many
you know there not really very many
places for error anywhere along
that and again you don't need to have a
that and again you don't need to have a
ton of low-level Dev experience either
ton of low-level Dev experience either
like I wrote python for 10 years the
like I wrote python for 10 years the
low-l stuff is relatively new to me um
low-l stuff is relatively new to me um
it's just it's not that hard is simply
it's just it's not that hard is simply
the case like it's really not any harder
the case like it's really not any harder
than writing these M's in Python
okay so let's look at this Connect 4 n
okay so let's look at this Connect 4 n
um I thought I had a c perf test in one
um I thought I had a c perf test in one
of
of
these I think I can just grab it from
these I think I can just grab it from
the MOBA
maybe yeah we'll just grab this test
maybe yeah we'll just grab this test
per how do you run just the H you don't
per how do you run just the H you don't
run the H you run the
run the H you run the
C so you make a little C file like this
C so you make a little C file like this
is the one right here this little tiny
is the one right here this little tiny
piece of code for Connect 4 and then you
piece of code for Connect 4 and then you
run
run
this you include the H for scyon so the
this you include the H for scyon so the
scon and python layer doesn't need the C
scon and python layer doesn't need the C
file it just needs the H the C is like
file it just needs the H the C is like
the Standalone in C which we use for
the Standalone in C which we use for
both building the web demo and for
both building the web demo and for
testing
locally let's do like
locally let's do like
this I'm going to make a perf test on
this I'm going to make a perf test on
your Connect 4 real
quick equals
quick equals
R
R
percent 7
[Music]
okay so then we just do build
ocean
ocean
local what's wrong here include time. h
what's wrong with this
build is the do c is what's used on the
build is the do c is what's used on the
website build yes got to get back to
website build yes got to get back to
work we'll look into this tonight
work we'll look into this tonight
excited to find out more great yeah I'm
excited to find out more great yeah I'm
on Pacific Time and in the evenings I
on Pacific Time and in the evenings I
will often hang out on the the voice
will often hang out on the the voice
chat and Discord while I'm doing other
chat and Discord while I'm doing other
stuff so uh I help people out and get
stuff so uh I help people out and get
people on there as well is there a list
people on there as well is there a list
of things that need implementing yes
of things that need implementing yes
check the uh the Discord see what is uh
check the uh the Discord see what is uh
interesting there there's like a status
interesting there there's like a status
report I just posted in the Gen chat um
report I just posted in the Gen chat um
and if you know there's nothing there
and if you know there's nothing there
that's interesting to you like we will
that's interesting to you like we will
find lots of other things we want to
find lots of other things we want to
build out a big library of games and
build out a big library of games and
simulations and things of various types
simulations and things of various types
here that's the goal
Jake how did this thing compile for
you it looks like there is a missing
you it looks like there is a missing
include right
don't you need
um okay it works now with standard D
um okay it works now with standard D
that's
weird wonder why you need that header I
weird wonder why you need that header I
don't know
uh shift
uh shift
exponent something's weird
exponent something's weird
here let me see if this is my screw
up I don't see where I would have broken
up I don't see where I would have broken
it this thing runs for
you it's kind of suspicious that that uh
you it's kind of suspicious that that uh
that built for you at all actually did
that built for you at all actually did
you build it with the uh the like what
you build it with the uh the like what
script did you use to build it did you
script did you use to build it did you
use the build ocean
script let me link this guy the
stream uh where should I link him the
stream uh where should I link him the
YouTube stream
[Music]
all testing was via scyon python okay I
all testing was via scyon python okay I
see so that's probably
yeah so typically what you're going to
yeah so typically what you're going to
want to do is and in fact it should be
want to do is and in fact it should be
easier to do it this way is you do the
easier to do it this way is you do the
testing in C um that will get you a much
testing in C um that will get you a much
much faster build time as well and it
much faster build time as well and it
will also get you things like um the
will also get you things like um the
address sanitizer like C is very painful
address sanitizer like C is very painful
to write without an address sanitizer uh
to write without an address sanitizer uh
it's very very easy with the address
it's very very easy with the address
sanitizer right like here it looks like
sanitizer right like here it looks like
we've got buffer overflows somewhere
we've got buffer overflows somewhere
here oops let's not do
[Music]
that
375 that's interesting
I did try build ocean but it didn't work
I did try build ocean but it didn't work
on Mac
on Mac
yes I have not tried it on
Mac
124 too large for
bit hold on something's weird let me
bit hold on something's weird let me
figure out what's some there's some
figure out what's some there's some
noise outside one
noise outside one
[Music]
sec all right it was just construction I
sec all right it was just construction I
thought someone was breaking down my
thought someone was breaking down my
door I have a script for that it has
door I have a script for that it has
different spags Flags Great yeah Spencer
different spags Flags Great yeah Spencer
if you want to add that script to uh the
if you want to add that script to uh the
build ocean I don't know if you can just
build ocean I don't know if you can just
like add like a platform switch or
like add like a platform switch or
something that would be great this
something that would be great this
debugging looks great would have been
debugging looks great would have been
helpful yeah I don't like making people
helpful yeah I don't like making people
do painful work right like it should be
do painful work right like it should be
a lot easier should be U 64t for
a lot easier should be U 64t for
column okay
are is this thing just an alias for like
are is this thing just an alias for like
a unsigned long by the
way now this thing has an exponent of
way now this thing has an exponent of
1785 so something's weird there possibly
1785 so something's weird there possibly
hold on
hold on
I did I instantiate this thing with dumb
arguments wait
760 oh wait
maybe this might be my fault let me
see piece width piece
see piece width piece
height no you don't set anything else
here obs actions rewards DS and
locks
locks
OBS
OBS
stuns these all look
stuns these all look
fine these all look fine
yeah
yeah
ideally one thing I was confused about
ideally one thing I was confused about
when I tried to print F in theh file in
when I tried to print F in theh file in
new infra it like holds off the
new infra it like holds off the
print did you forget a sln
print did you forget a sln
Spencer did you forget like printa with
Spencer did you forget like printa with
a sln at the
a sln at the
end rows and columns should also not be
end rows and columns should also not be
int python build much more permissive I
int python build much more permissive I
don't know that's
don't know that's
weird um I'm surprised the python build
weird um I'm surprised the python build
works
works
then I mean I can compile without these
then I mean I can compile without these
flags and see what happens but I think
flags and see what happens but I think
it'll
break I had a fast mode maybe I didn't
break I had a fast mode maybe I didn't
commit
that here this is a fast mode for
that here this is a fast mode for
testing I needed to commit this
testing I needed to commit this
this will be useful for contributors as
this will be useful for contributors as
well uh you just get rid of the F
well uh you just get rid of the F
sanitized Flags mind you that means that
sanitized Flags mind you that means that
you are not checking for
you are not checking for
overflows and things like that okay this
overflows and things like that okay this
actually does work so this is what
actually does work so this is what
happens though this is what happens if
happens though this is what happens if
you uh you run it as is like it's
you uh you run it as is like it's
skipping all your moves and then this
skipping all your moves and then this
thing is
thing is
purple so yeah there's some bugs to fix
purple so yeah there's some bugs to fix
here um
Jake do you want me to commit this how
Jake do you want me to commit this how
about I commit you this perf test and um
about I commit you this perf test and um
do you want to see if you can fix it
do you want to see if you can fix it
from from here I'm also I'm happy to
from from here I'm also I'm happy to
debug this live if you get stuck on it
debug this live if you get stuck on it
but would you like to give uh give it a
but would you like to give uh give it a
shot
first fascinating yeah this is how you
first fascinating yeah this is how you
can test more
easily I want another go
gotcha there you go so there's your
gotcha there you go so there's your
there's your easier test harness for
there's your easier test harness for
that uh let me know if that doesn't work
that uh let me know if that doesn't work
Spencer can you paste the uh the flags
Spencer can you paste the uh the flags
for Jake
somewhere I don't have a Mac to like to
somewhere I don't have a Mac to like to
fix that
fix that
stuff oh cool ramy's doing stuff with
stuff oh cool ramy's doing stuff with
viz
Doom um if anybody has like questions
Doom um if anybody has like questions
and like or is looking for a specific en
and like or is looking for a specific en
to be put on um would be a good time to
to be put on um would be a good time to
do that cuz otherwise uh until there's
do that cuz otherwise uh until there's
more stuff to merge there's like a
more stuff to merge there's like a
rocket M that I could work on for a bit
rocket M that I could work on for a bit
uh there are a few other environments
uh there are a few other environments
that I might just start working on um
that I might just start working on um
but I'd be happy to get people
but I'd be happy to get people
onto stuff um the the key
things l
so the key thing here and I posted this

breakout I'm going to go push some small
breakout I'm going to go push some small
changes I'm going to go actually I
changes I'm going to go actually I
should grab my laptop and push that I
should grab my laptop and push that I
would like somebody to fix breakout it
would like somebody to fix breakout it
needs some small fixes and uh Noah is
needs some small fixes and uh Noah is
not going to have time to do it it's a
not going to have time to do it it's a
relatively small scope project for a new
relatively small scope project for a new
Dev it just needs like some cleanup and
Dev it just needs like some cleanup and
testing there's some stuff where like if
testing there's some stuff where like if
you hit the brick from the side the
you hit the brick from the side the
check doesn't even isn't done so it'll
check doesn't even isn't done so it'll
like clear all the bricks or something
like clear all the bricks or something
um robocode is like a slightly more
um robocode is like a slightly more
midsize project that kind of just needs
midsize project that kind of just needs
one somewhat more experienced Dev uh not
one somewhat more experienced Dev uh not
crazy hard or anything uh to do it's a
crazy hard or anything uh to do it's a
port of a tank battle thing that used to
port of a tank battle thing that used to
be used to teach people how to code in
be used to teach people how to code in
Java ported it I did an initial port to
Java ported it I did an initial port to
see and uh it just needs to be like
see and uh it just needs to be like
fully fleshed out and stuff but it's in
fully fleshed out and stuff but it's in
like a good starting spot uh triple
like a good starting spot uh triple
Triad needs a greedy opponent policy so
Triad needs a greedy opponent policy so
that we can have something decent to
that we can have something decent to
play against multi-agent snake could use
play against multi-agent snake could use
a similarly small refactor probably like
a similarly small refactor probably like
pong but maybe even a little bit
pong but maybe even a little bit
easier
easier
um let's see TCG is a bigger project so
um let's see TCG is a bigger project so
if somebody's interested in like taking
if somebody's interested in like taking
point on the start of a bigger project
point on the start of a bigger project
this one actually we have some academic
this one actually we have some academic
collabs on that are going to be starting
collabs on that are going to be starting
soon so this one would be really cool um
soon so this one would be really cool um
also if you have your own game M that
also if you have your own game M that
you're like hey I have this thing and
you're like hey I have this thing and
want to like bind it for Puffer that
want to like bind it for Puffer that
would be cool as
would be cool as
well unfortunately on a construction
well unfortunately on a construction
site and comp is dead so it won't be
site and comp is dead so it won't be
able to send script okay well no
able to send script okay well no
worries
worries
um Jake you might have to Google a
um Jake you might have to Google a
couple Flags
also the cluster the cluster policy for
also the cluster the cluster policy for
reference is uh once people start like
reference is uh once people start like
actually submitting substantial mdev and
actually submitting substantial mdev and
want to be running like experiments on
want to be running like experiments on
stuff that's when you get uh you get
stuff that's when you get uh you get
access to a cluster
access to a cluster
machine that's the collab policy on
that thinking need to familiarize myself
that thinking need to familiarize myself
with libraries and repos David here yeah
with libraries and repos David here yeah
um I tried to make it very simple
um I tried to make it very simple
Standalone stuff like if you if you want
Standalone stuff like if you if you want
to just get started adding an M or like
to just get started adding an M or like
fixing up an existing M basically all
fixing up an existing M basically all
the code you need for the simpler ones
the code you need for the simpler ones
is a few hundred lines in a file so this
is a few hundred lines in a file so this
is the like this is the pong M that we
have you can see here this is the RL
have you can see here this is the RL
agent playing pong versus this built-in
agent playing pong versus this built-in
opponent the pong M itself is 300 some
opponent the pong M itself is 300 some
odd lines a very simple procedural
odd lines a very simple procedural
python that is very similar to what you
python that is very similar to what you
would see if you were just writing this
would see if you were just writing this
normally as a game and not thinking
normally as a game and not thinking
about reinforcement learning at
about reinforcement learning at
all and then the actual RL agent in here
all and then the actual RL agent in here
is just grabbing uh this network from
is just grabbing uh this network from
puffer N.H which is is a uh 500 line
puffer N.H which is is a uh 500 line
Standalone neuronet inference library
Standalone neuronet inference library
that I wrote that matches pytorch but
that I wrote that matches pytorch but
this is it this is the whole code that
this is it this is the whole code that
runs on the web and we just compile this
runs on the web and we just compile this
to web assembly you can compile it
to web assembly you can compile it
locally as well for
locally as well for
testing and we provide tools for that
testing and we provide tools for that
puffer Li itself is a fair bit larger
puffer Li itself is a fair bit larger
but uh if you're just looking to get
but uh if you're just looking to get
started this is kind of a good spot and
started this is kind of a good spot and
then the idea is that like people write
then the idea is that like people write
M or people help polish up M and if they
M or people help polish up M and if they
want to get involved more in the
want to get involved more in the
experiment and RL side I provide input
experiment and RL side I provide input
on that and I can show you how to like
on that and I can show you how to like
start getting experiments running over
start getting experiments running over
these
M even the more complic ated projects
M even the more complic ated projects
that we have like this MOA this MOA is
that we have like this MOA this MOA is
still just one C file it's a 2,000 line
still just one C file it's a 2,000 line
C file instead of a 300 line C file but
C file instead of a 300 line C file but
it's very simple procedural code like
it's very simple procedural code like
you can read this thing top to bottom
you can read this thing top to bottom
and there won't be any
surprises is generally how I try to keep
surprises is generally how I try to keep
the work around
here oh
awesome for
cool lots of new potential contributors
cool lots of new potential contributors
that's
that's
awesome we're really going to get this
awesome we're really going to get this
project off the
ground that's
great I guess while I'm in between
great I guess while I'm in between
answering stuff here let me go get the
answering stuff here let me go get the
breakout en it's on my laptop at the
breakout en it's on my laptop at the
moment uh I'm going to take 2 minutes
moment uh I'm going to take 2 minutes
put another put the kettle on for more
put another put the kettle on for more
coffee or tea or whatever uh I'm going
coffee or tea or whatever uh I'm going
to grab my laptop so I can sync up the
to grab my laptop so I can sync up the
breakout code cuz I want somebody to be
breakout code cuz I want somebody to be
able to clean that up and then I'll
able to clean that up and then I'll
probably do that and then start on some
probably do that and then start on some
more stuff with the rocket M uh in like
more stuff with the rocket M uh in like
a couple hours once I finish all that be
a couple hours once I finish all that be
right
back
e
e e
okay so I uh I woke up early this
okay so I uh I woke up early this
morning and immediately started
morning and immediately started
refactoring the breakout code on my
refactoring the breakout code on my
laptop um I'm going
laptop um I'm going
to commit this up real quick and then
to commit this up real quick and then
I'm going to start working on it on here
I'm going to start working on it on here
uh I'm not going to fully finish it cuz
uh I'm not going to fully finish it cuz
hopefully one of you will take over that
hopefully one of you will take over that
refactor it's a pretty easy job for a
refactor it's a pretty easy job for a
new
new
contributor
contributor
um
yeah hold
yeah hold
on let me Commit This real
quick
out one minute here out. c breakout. h
break out
minior get push origin
minior get push origin
Dev get
P
P
push
push
yes
okay
so this is now a very nice little
so this is now a very nice little
Standalone thing for somebody to
do I'll show you the uh the state of
this okay so here's our breakout en it
this okay so here's our breakout en it
actually has a train policy already
actually has a train policy already
playing it you can see here you can hold
playing it you can see here you can hold
shift to take over for the
shift to take over for the
agent it's like up to fire the ball and
agent it's like up to fire the ball and
then left and right um but like this en
then left and right um but like this en
is very glitchy and there are just some
is very glitchy and there are just some
things that need to be better with the
things that need to be better with the
code like the Collision checks right now
code like the Collision checks right now
it you can like hit the uh the bricks
it you can like hit the uh the bricks
from the side and it'll like go through
from the side and it'll like go through
a whole bunch of them basically it just
a whole bunch of them basically it just
needs to be like polished up and made
needs to be like polished up and made
into a slightly less exploitable game uh
into a slightly less exploitable game uh
it is a lot easier than the original
it is a lot easier than the original
Atari Breakout as well I think that
Atari Breakout as well I think that
that's kind of okay because the original
that's kind of okay because the original
Atari Breakout game is really
Atari Breakout game is really
like it'll just randomly slam the ball
like it'll just randomly slam the ball
back at you very fast okay yeah just
back at you very fast okay yeah just
there you saw the puffer just kind of
there you saw the puffer just kind of
like ate a bunch of blocks cuz the
like ate a bunch of blocks cuz the
Collision checks are bad so just a few
Collision checks are bad so just a few
small things like that um it doesn't
small things like that um it doesn't
show you the second screen of bricks in
show you the second screen of bricks in
the original Atari game there are two
the original Atari game there are two
screens of bricks so you get two levels
screens of bricks so you get two levels
to clear it doesn't do that correctly um
to clear it doesn't do that correctly um
and I don't think it resets cleanly when
and I don't think it resets cleanly when
you beat all the bricks as well that
you beat all the bricks as well that
plus minor code refactors so if anybody
plus minor code refactors so if anybody
wants to just take this on that would be
wants to just take this on that would be
awesome
awesome
um
yeah
for
[Music]
for
for e
there we go that's a pretty good
response looks good to me could start
response looks good to me could start
working on breakout or Robo code awesome
working on breakout or Robo code awesome
yeah depends on your uh your level of
yeah depends on your uh your level of
experience oh I missed your thing slime
experience oh I missed your thing slime
volley hadn't thought of that game in
volley hadn't thought of that game in
two decades yeah we would also be very
two decades yeah we would also be very
happy to have that as an EnV but it uses
happy to have that as an EnV but it uses
like really janky old physics um it
like really janky old physics um it
would have to be either probably the
would have to be either probably the
easiest thing would just to be to have
easiest thing would just to be to have
it do its own custom physics as like a
it do its own custom physics as like a
single file CNF um with rayb for render
single file CNF um with rayb for render
uh we'd be very happy to have that one
uh we'd be very happy to have that one
if you want to do a new project we have
if you want to do a new project we have
plenty of projects at the moment that
plenty of projects at the moment that
need to be finished if you want to take
need to be finished if you want to take
the breakout one that would actually
the breakout one that would actually
just be awesome the robo code one is a
just be awesome the robo code one is a
slightly larger project so depends on
slightly larger project so depends on
your level of experience hold
on okay yeah you're very qualified for
on okay yeah you're very qualified for
this types of this type of stuff then so
this types of this type of stuff then so
yeah either basically if you want
yeah either basically if you want
something small to start with that's
something small to start with that's
just like a pretty simple little
just like a pretty simple little
refactor and like fix some weird buggy
refactor and like fix some weird buggy
Collision stuff you can do the breakout
Collision stuff you can do the breakout
it probably won't take you more than a
it probably won't take you more than a
few hours and then uh the robocode one
few hours and then uh the robocode one
is going to be like a probably few Day
is going to be like a probably few Day
project um for someone with decent
project um for someone with decent
systems
background this is so great to have
background this is so great to have
people doing this stuff break out to get
people doing this stuff break out to get
the gears turning yeah I figure that
the gears turning yeah I figure that
that's like a nice little contribution
that's like a nice little contribution
and basically the way it works around
and basically the way it works around
here is whenever people finish stuff I
here is whenever people finish stuff I
will either review it on stream or in a
will either review it on stream or in a
voice call in Discord either way as soon
voice call in Discord either way as soon
as people are done with stuff in our
as people are done with stuff in our
Frey glad I found your post so am I we
Frey glad I found your post so am I we
could really use the contribution help
could really use the contribution help
like I kind of just got sick of stuff
like I kind of just got sick of stuff
this morning and just started tweeting
this morning and just started tweeting
cuz it's like okay look this update has
cuz it's like okay look this update has
just dragged on for too long because
just dragged on for too long because
there is only so much code that I can
there is only so much code that I can
write you know like I have to do the
write you know like I have to do the
core of puffer mostly myself I'm also
core of puffer mostly myself I'm also
like trying to juggle all these
like trying to juggle all these
different environments and it's just
different environments and it's just
it's too much to do all of um and it's
it's too much to do all of um and it's
an a Very scalable open- Source problem
an a Very scalable open- Source problem
right like these M's are basically
right like these M's are basically
completely independent they're pretty
completely independent they're pretty
small and isolated they only take like a
small and isolated they only take like a
developer per EnV to do
properly and I figured it's a good way
properly and I figured it's a good way
for people to get into the space as well
for people to get into the space as well
like I don't know Spencer joined a few
like I don't know Spencer joined a few
weeks ago and he already made he did the
weeks ago and he already made he did the
Prototype well he did Connect 4 before
Prototype well he did Connect 4 before
the rewrite that Jack just did he did
the rewrite that Jack just did he did
the Triad en and he's working on go now
the Triad en and he's working on go now
already running experiments and stuff so
already running experiments and stuff so
it's pretty easy to spin people up on
it's pretty easy to spin people up on
the RL side once they're doing
the RL side once they're doing
this yeah it's the best kind of parallel
this yeah it's the best kind of parallel
embarrassingly parallel for the most
embarrassingly parallel for the most
part occasionally I have to go in and
part occasionally I have to go in and
mess with like the uh the harnesses like
mess with like the uh the harnesses like
the bindings for these
the bindings for these
M and I still have to do that manually
M and I still have to do that manually
we're trying to cut down on boiler plate
we're trying to cut down on boiler plate
and cut down on boiler plate there's
and cut down on boiler plate there's
like a third of the boiler plate that
like a third of the boiler plate that
there used to be um there's still a few
there used to be um there's still a few
things I think we could cut down a
things I think we could cut down a
little bit on the scyon but I have to
little bit on the scyon but I have to
figure that out still oh did you say
figure that out still oh did you say
wait
wait
Cuda I didn't see if you had physics
Cuda I didn't see if you had physics
background because we do want to be
background because we do want to be
doing more physics stuff at some
doing more physics stuff at some
point lce yeah this
point lce yeah this
is that's some crazy
is that's some crazy
stuff heavy on computation Cuda M C++
okay well if you want to do physics
okay well if you want to do physics
stuff um hold
on we've got uh I started working on
on we've got uh I started working on
this earlier this week and I think
this earlier this week and I think
there's a UT Austin PhD student who's
there's a UT Austin PhD student who's
also interested in helping with
this does this
run hold on let me add box 2D
where's bux 2D
gone
gone
uh hold on let me show you this
demo is it just like d
demo is it just like d
i
box did I only bind it to setup.py
where did my thing
where did my thing
go that's bizarre
let me get this thing to build real
let me get this thing to build real
quick because we've got like this rocket
quick because we've got like this rocket
Lander en that I
Lander en that I
started un
started un
2dh where did this thing go hold
2dh where did this thing go hold
on I could have sworn that
on I could have sworn that
I I pushed like um bucks to D build
I I pushed like um bucks to D build
flags
that's so
weird let me find that so I I can show
weird let me find that so I I can show
in the meantime though the thing that I
in the meantime though the thing that I
uh we were building off of um it in
uh we were building off of um it in
honor of of SpaceX Landing uh the crazy
honor of of SpaceX Landing uh the crazy
rocket I found there's this rocket en
rocket I found there's this rocket en
Landing en here that uh uses really old
Landing en here that uh uses really old
janky python bindings for box 2D and I
janky python bindings for box 2D and I
ported it to C and I got it to be very
ported it to C and I got it to be very
fast like a basic version of it this is
fast like a basic version of it this is
what it looked like in a python Port the
what it looked like in a python Port the
python Port was too slow but um
python Port was too slow but um
basically I've been working on this side
basically I've been working on this side
and I've been having a ton of trouble
and I've been having a ton of trouble
figuring out the phys PHS uh the physics
figuring out the phys PHS uh the physics
side of this and the physics API with
side of this and the physics API with
box 2D and stuff um generally we do want
box 2D and stuff um generally we do want
to have much better support for physics
to have much better support for physics
types M's and yeah I just we generally
types M's and yeah I just we generally
would like to have somebody who knows
would like to have somebody who knows
that space and uh knows how to make that
that space and uh knows how to make that
stuff be
fast so if you're interested in that
fast so if you're interested in that
side that's another thing we could
explore not sure if that's what you're
explore not sure if that's what you're
trying to get into or if that's what
trying to get into or if that's what
you're trying to get away from either
you're trying to get away from either
way we're happy to have
contributions let me find this like
just need
just need
the source file shouldn't
I I have this let me go find where this
I I have this let me go find where this
thing was so I can build the rocket M
thing was so I can build the rocket M
and start working on that on the side
and start working on that on the side
today I think that PhD student's going
today I think that PhD student's going
to want to play with this m tomorrow and
to want to play with this m tomorrow and
it doesn't train
yet oh do I have to link it
oh do I just need Dash L box 2D
still
no hang on we'll have a cool rocket
no hang on we'll have a cool rocket
Lander and in a
Lander and in a
second I forgot the include
second I forgot the include
right yeah I I did this wrong so this is
right yeah I I did this wrong so this is
duh you have to link this- I include
duh you have to link this- I include
there we
there we
[Music]
[Music]
go okay so here's our very very basic
go okay so here's our very very basic
version of this rocket Lander en you can
version of this rocket Lander en you can
mess with the rocket in all sorts of
ways physics is kind of
ways physics is kind of
janky 2D physics engines have a bunch of
janky 2D physics engines have a bunch of
particular problems which honestly game
particular problems which honestly game
devs are more suited to than physicists
devs are more suited to than physicists
but I have a full tool belt of things to
but I have a full tool belt of things to
try that's cool I mean we're not really
try that's cool I mean we're not really
linked to um weird physics engines
linked to um weird physics engines
either like I just was using this cuz
either like I just was using this cuz
this was here I mean if you're going to
this was here I mean if you're going to
tell me that like hey this physics
tell me that like hey this physics
engine ends up being like 10 lines of
engine ends up being like 10 lines of
math and we can just Implement like a
math and we can just Implement like a
100 lines of code that's going to be
100 lines of code that's going to be
good enough for a lot of the physics
good enough for a lot of the physics
stuff that we are going to want to do
stuff that we are going to want to do
I'm very happy with that as well just
I'm very happy with that as well just
trying to get more open source
trying to get more open source
contributions under my belt and this
contributions under my belt and this
seems like a fun project yeah absolutely
seems like a fun project yeah absolutely
and this is a very good way to get into
and this is a very good way to get into
um Ai and RL space as well if that's
um Ai and RL space as well if that's
something that you're
something that you're
interested in um because with puffer
interested in um because with puffer
it's actually pretty darn easy to get
it's actually pretty darn easy to get
these things to train now with how fast
these things to train now with how fast
it goes single body single platform yeah
it goes single body single platform yeah
10 Lin sounds right single body single
10 Lin sounds right single body single
platform okay I
see the original end was a little bit
see the original end was a little bit
more than that they had
more than that they had
um where is it the original en had like
um where is it the original en had like
a little bit more stuff because
a little bit more stuff because
let me show you the
let me show you the
rocket I actually kind of think it's
rocket I actually kind of think it's
funny to have a rocket Landing end
funny to have a rocket Landing end
because it's like AI isn't rocket
because it's like AI isn't rocket
science until it
science until it
is but um I mean it's obviously way
is but um I mean it's obviously way
simplified so here they have like this
simplified so here they have like this
landing gear thing as well on it and you
landing gear thing as well on it and you
can apply a force from the bottom and
can apply a force from the bottom and
you can also apply force from the top at
you can also apply force from the top at
either side with these like
thrusters so that's what we're doing
here the Falcon 9 is like seven years
here the Falcon 9 is like seven years
old okay bet if you want mechazilla
old okay bet if you want mechazilla
Chopstick arms for landing rocket M pull
Chopstick arms for landing rocket M pull
up and code it
Elon wants
Elon wants
them I mean it kind of worked the guy
them I mean it kind of worked the guy
wasn't wrong
wasn't wrong
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
right crazy that it worked but it did
work he is usually right it
seems I mean he like like there wouldn't
seems I mean he like like there wouldn't
be any he wouldn't get any respect for
be any he wouldn't get any respect for
the crazy things he does uh unless he
the crazy things he does uh unless he
ended up being right most of the time
ended up being right most of the time
right that's the that's the hard part
right that's the that's the hard part
you actually have to be
you actually have to be
right otherwise you're just a
manager okay I don't know why I feel
manager okay I don't know why I feel
like torturing myself with this rocket
like torturing myself with this rocket
Lander end right now but probably want
Lander end right now but probably want
to do a little bit on it going to try to
to do a little bit on it going to try to
fix breakout and let you know when I
fix breakout and let you know when I
have a PR up awesome I will be streaming
have a PR up awesome I will be streaming
for the next probably 4 4 and a half
for the next probably 4 4 and a half
hours on this and then after that I'll
hours on this and then after that I'll
be uh probably in the Discord for like
be uh probably in the Discord for like
an hour or so after
an hour or so after
that that's the usual schedule
okay is this the updated version of the
N I don't know if this is the updated
N I don't know if this is the updated
version of the N this uh this does not
version of the N this uh this does not
feel like it controls correctly I just
feel like it controls correctly I just
tap the key once and it starts spinning
tap the key once and it starts spinning
out of
control yeah I could have sworn that I
control yeah I could have sworn that I
like I had fixed this portion here where
like I had fixed this portion here where
like the the actions weren't synced up
like the the actions weren't synced up
um that's kind of
um that's kind of
weird that's no big
weird that's no big
deal at least do we have the RL harness
deal at least do we have the RL harness
for this yet in this
version looks like we do
so now you just tap it and you can tap
so now you just tap it and you can tap
it back like
this looks good office
this looks good office
hours bet is our resident Advertiser but
hours bet is our resident Advertiser but
uh we do appreciate
uh we do appreciate
stars on the
stars on the
repository it uh it actually really
repository it uh it actually really
really helps to have stars on this thing
really helps to have stars on this thing
because it means that more people see
because it means that more people see
the project and we get more
the project and we get more
contributions and we get more bug
contributions and we get more bug
reports and things like that so feed the
reports and things like that so feed the
puffer
star can I run train on this now
what's the current
reward there's an out of bounds
reward there's an out of bounds
penalty
um hold on blender in the
background e
[Music]
[Music]
Blended Seven Ways to
Sunday okay
so how is there no rocket
Lander oh I think it's cuz I just
Lander oh I think it's cuz I just
commented Out Hold
commented Out Hold
On The One obnoxious thing about this
On The One obnoxious thing about this
rocket EnV is like um because it
rocket EnV is like um because it
includes box 2D it kind of complicates
includes box 2D it kind of complicates
the puffer setup a little bit so we're
the puffer setup a little bit so we're
going to have to figure out something to
going to have to figure out something to
do with that but for now we'll just mess
do with that but for now we'll just mess
mess with it
locally okay so here we have a random
locally okay so here we have a random
policy is controlling this
thing let's figure out with the reward
thing let's figure out with the reward
function of this
thing I did a whole bunch of stuff with
thing I did a whole bunch of stuff with
this reward that I don't actually
this reward that I don't actually
know if is a good
idea what if I just ignore this for
now and
then also I'm happy to get people
then also I'm happy to get people
onboarded with stuff and like working on
onboarded with stuff and like working on
things um while I'm doing this I'm kind
things um while I'm doing this I'm kind
of just working on this m in the
of just working on this m in the
background in the meantime of stuff you
background in the meantime of stuff you
know oh this is awful these parameters
know oh this is awful these parameters
are just
are just
awful uh
awful uh
huh yeah this is very
weird we'll run this once just to see
[Music]
[Music]
my head is covering
this okay so we should get a WP chart
this okay so we should get a WP chart
for
this
oops and we'll see how this
does
sweeps okay so here's
sweeps okay so here's
our rocket Lander en and it can't
our rocket Lander en and it can't
doesn't really learn to do anything
doesn't really learn to do anything
initially so I think that there's just
initially so I think that there's just
something wrong this is a very new
something wrong this is a very new
project and um like I've messed some
project and um like I've messed some
things up with
things up with
it it's going back
um it is starting to optimize
interestingly we'll see whether it
interestingly we'll see whether it
actually gets any better than this but I
actually gets any better than this but I
will be interested to see what this
will be interested to see what this
policy
policy
does Discord
Jake will probably have a Connect 4 PR
Jake will probably have a Connect 4 PR
at some
point Spencer's got Go stuff going
on BET do you have uh do you have Enduro
on BET do you have uh do you have Enduro
code for me to look at at some point
code for me to look at at some point
today or are you good on dev at the
today or are you good on dev at the
moment seg
fault all right we had some work to do
fault all right we had some work to do
there
then uh was it getting
worse Enduro is basically logically
worse Enduro is basically logically
there okay awesome
goal is to get more M's onto website
goal is to get more M's onto website
soon oh let me actually make a
post for
cool nice little Enduro version nice
cool nice little Enduro version nice
need to make it pretty as well yeah it
need to make it pretty as well yeah it
is somewhat important
is somewhat important
not unimportant at
not unimportant at
least um okay so our new experiment here
least um okay so our new experiment here
this is
crashing rewards crashing
crashing rewards crashing
here the goal with this is to just have
here the goal with this is to just have
like some sort of rocket that does that
like some sort of rocket that does that
does a
thing so I can hopefully get a build out
thing so I can hopefully get a build out
that PhD student wanted to use it for a
that PhD student wanted to use it for a
demo at some point pretty soon
model

o
39 maybe this is okay
wouldn't mind helping with RL
wouldn't mind helping with RL
integration not main ISS codes there
integration not main ISS codes there
there are some C things not quite lining
there are some C things not quite lining
up like what are you compiling with the
up like what are you compiling with the
uh this F address sanitized Flags cuz
uh this F address sanitized Flags cuz
that should help a lot
yes it seems
yes it seems
fine like what is the actual problem
fine like what is the actual problem
that you're dealing
with that's a weird model
couldn't diagnose with GDB either it's
couldn't diagnose with GDB either it's
very
weird I have to install torch yeah no
weird I have to install torch yeah no
problem
very weird how
very weird how
this so what I can't figure out here is
this so what I can't figure out here is
that technically it should just be able
that technically it should just be able
to learn to not do anything and that
to learn to not do anything and that
actually should give it decent reward
actually should give it decent reward
um I would like to at least have a
um I would like to at least have a
rocket that can like land itself with
rocket that can like land itself with
some perturbations before we go crazy on
some perturbations before we go crazy on
the physics
the physics
side just to like a
side just to like a
decent decent little environment you
decent decent little environment you
know
know
um let me see I got to go print
um let me see I got to go print
out I'll print out
out I'll print out
the reward obtained
here let's just do
okay so now you can see the reward
okay so now you can see the reward
function
here I wonder if this is like that old
here I wonder if this is like that old
continuous reward
problem I bet you this is just a
problem I bet you this is just a
continuous rewards being dumb problem to
continuous rewards being dumb problem to
be
be
honest what information does it have it
honest what information does it have it
has the same information pretty much
has the same information pretty much
from the original it knows its position
from the original it knows its position
it's like its
it's like its
velocities um torque stuff like that I
think final link
failed
value do you want to just PR the N bet
value do you want to just PR the N bet
because that just looks like bad setup
because that just looks like bad setup
stuff
I don't mind having like half done M's
I don't mind having like half done M's
in the dev Branch it is a Dev Branch
in the dev Branch it is a Dev Branch
after
after
all oh that's you trying to install
all oh that's you trying to install
torch never
torch never
mind yeah okay you can fix your own
mind yeah okay you can fix your own
torch
errors yeah you can fix your own torch
errors yeah you can fix your own torch
errors let me fix this reward function

few Pokemon is hard but it's slow MOA
few Pokemon is hard but it's slow MOA
MOA is probably pretty hard that's like
MOA is probably pretty hard that's like
a very complex environment um when we
a very complex environment um when we
finish the TCG the TCG will probably be
finish the TCG the TCG will probably be
medium or hard um the secret M that I
medium or hard um the secret M that I
have is probably also going to be medium
have is probably also going to be medium
or hard uh probably hard Robo code will

probably be
probably be

mediumish um yeah the goal is to have
like a spectrum of M's right so like
like a spectrum of M's right so like
easy would be pong and
easy would be pong and
breakout um maybe try it I don't know
breakout um maybe try it I don't know
how hard try it is to be honest it might
how hard try it is to be honest it might
be hard Connect 4 might actually be

decently challenging once we have a good
decently challenging once we have a good
opponent policy snake is probably pretty
opponent policy snake is probably pretty
easy
easy
um MOA is definitely harder
um MOA is definitely harder
right uh go is going to be harder go is
right uh go is going to be harder go is
very configurable it can be easy medium
very configurable it can be easy medium
or hard depending on board size you know
or hard depending on board size you know
there should be like a decent range of
there should be like a decent range of
different
different
complexities um things we're lacking on
complexities um things we're lacking on
at the moment we're definitely lacking
at the moment we're definitely lacking
like enough continuous control style Ms
like enough continuous control style Ms
we definitely need more like continuous
we definitely need more like continuous
M um and yeah
M um and yeah
probably that's going to be the main
probably that's going to be the main
thing the problem with the the harder Ms
thing the problem with the the harder Ms
is like you need to find stuff that's
is like you need to find stuff that's
not going to take two months to
not going to take two months to
implement just one M right like the Moa
implement just one M right like the Moa
actually took like two months to do all
actually took like two months to do all
the stuff that was in
the stuff that was in
it and it's like it's a pretty decent
it and it's like it's a pretty decent
mob it has a couple render bugs um but
mob it has a couple render bugs um but
it's not like even a full a fullon mob
it's not like even a full a fullon mob
or anything right like you could spend a
or anything right like you could spend a
lot of time improving stuff like the
lot of time improving stuff like the
Autos are actually automatic there's not
Autos are actually automatic there's not
a way to do like a laning phase where
a way to do like a laning phase where
you have to go back and forth with Autos
you have to go back and forth with Autos
it's kind of just like um you know team
it's kind of just like um you know team
battle simulator down mid at the moment
battle simulator down mid at the moment
though probably there is potential to
though probably there is potential to
learn like s side laning
stuff yeah
it's previous X and Y
I'm trying to think how I want to do
this I guess we'll just have to
this I guess we'll just have to
do we'll just paste it for
do we'll just paste it for
now X
why I want to change the way that the
why I want to change the way that the
rewards are structured this is I can't
rewards are structured this is I can't
believe that I made this error
believe that I made this error
again with the way that I made a
again with the way that I made a
continuous
continuous
rewards kind of a noob
rewards kind of a noob
error I'm pretty sure that as soon as I
error I'm pretty sure that as soon as I
fix this it'll
work this is actually going to be an
work this is actually going to be an
instructive thing for people interested
instructive thing for people interested
in the RL side though so we have
in the RL side though so we have
rev
rev
X rev y so the the key here is that um
X rev y so the the key here is that um
if you give a continuous reward that's
if you give a continuous reward that's
just like the position or like the
just like the position or like the
distance from something it's actually
distance from something it's actually
kind of hard to learn because if you
kind of hard to learn because if you
take a small step the reward only
take a small step the reward only
changes a little tiny bit whereas if you
changes a little tiny bit whereas if you
say you get a reward for going in the
say you get a reward for going in the
right direction and a negative reward
right direction and a negative reward
for going in the wrong direction that is
for going in the wrong direction that is
much much easier to
much much easier to
learn so what we'll simply do
what's the
uh let me
think so reward X is going to
be going to be
be going to be
previous hold on
xus is this correct let's
see you
want yeah it's cuz you want to go you
want yeah it's cuz you want to go you
want to get closer to the center
want to get closer to the center
okay and
okay and
then this next
then this next
one uh you want to get closer to the
one uh you want to get closer to the
bottom right so you want to
do the same thing with Y to be
honest and then do we divide by I don't
honest and then do we divide by I don't
think we have to should divide by as
think we have to should divide by as
much
much
anymore um this is probably only divide
anymore um this is probably only divide
by like a
by like a
thousand let's see if this does anything
different reward
y redefinition of transform
okay
so this reward
so this reward
Y is not good I don't know why it's not
Y is not good I don't know why it's not
giving Us rewards
oh because this has to go duh this has
oh because this has to go duh this has
to go up
here yeah yeah yeah this has to go all
here yeah yeah yeah this has to go all
the way up
here try this
all right
all right
now now you can see we're actually
now now you can see we're actually
getting positive rewards
getting positive rewards
right in positive rewards and now we get
right in positive rewards and now we get
Negative rewards for going up
hey how's it
going I think that the Thruster is done
going I think that the Thruster is done
incorrectly it should still be able to
incorrectly it should still be able to
optimize for this
though let's see if uh let's see if this
though let's see if uh let's see if this
will actually learn anything now
oh this reward is still just
tiny there we
tiny there we
go that's that's got some teeth to it
go that's that's got some teeth to it
we're going to run a new
we're going to run a new
experiment and then uh we will see
whether I have figured anything out with
this check Discord in the
meantime tried visdom oblig
uh I don't see anything that should mess
uh I don't see anything that should mess
it up
oh
is this
learning let's see if we get WB curves
learning let's see if we get WB curves
for uh this
rocket and folks I'm just kind of
rocket and folks I'm just kind of
chilling and deving on this in the
chilling and deving on this in the
meantime um if anybody has questions on
meantime um if anybody has questions on
like projects to get started on or
like projects to get started on or
whatnot very happy to get people uh get
whatnot very happy to get people uh get
people going on
people going on
puffer okay so this is just unstable
puffer okay so this is just unstable
right probably crappy hyper
parameters yeah these are insane
[Music]
uh oh
uh oh
oh is probably
oh is probably
[Music]
[Music]
good just going to set some things that
good just going to set some things that
I know to be like generally
I know to be like generally
reasonable hyper
reasonable hyper
parameters we'll see what this gets
us there's kind of this little Quirk
us there's kind of this little Quirk
with the way that carbs does hyper
with the way that carbs does hyper
parameter sweeps where it'll find like
parameter sweeps where it'll find like
these really decent learning curves that
these really decent learning curves that
are very
are very
unstable we're kind of looking into
that oh this is
that oh this is
weird this rapidly gets even worse
are we still
are we still
unstable we're still very
unstable this
K that's very
weird did I mess something up oh yeah I
weird did I mess something up oh yeah I
messed up totally the mini batch size is
messed up totally the mini batch size is
horrible
let's try
again there we
again there we
go when you're looking at WB curves and
go when you're looking at WB curves and
watching episode returns you assuming it
watching episode returns you assuming it
should be immediately getting better not
should be immediately getting better not
necessarily it's just taking a little
necessarily it's just taking a little
longer to figure out a tough State
longer to figure out a tough State
action space so I'm looking at here is
action space so I'm looking at here is
these curves exploding these loss curves
these curves exploding these loss curves
exploding this is a diverging policy um
exploding this is a diverging policy um
it's not like flat or anything it's
diverging um and I have I know that the
diverging um and I have I know that the
specific combination of hyper parameters
specific combination of hyper parameters
there is likely to cause that because I
there is likely to cause that because I
had the mini batch set very very small
had the mini batch set very very small
relative to the batch size meaning that
relative to the batch size meaning that
it's doing a ton of small updates on
it's doing a ton of small updates on
stale data which can often be unstable
stale data which can often be unstable
so I just switched that out and now I'm
so I just switched that out and now I'm
going to see whether it's more stable or
going to see whether it's more stable or
other stuff is wrong here now a lot of
other stuff is wrong here now a lot of
this work you shouldn't often have have
this work you shouldn't often have have
to be doing manually but because this is
to be doing manually but because this is
a new environment and I don't know for
a new environment and I don't know for
sure whether it is the environment
sure whether it is the environment
that's broken or the uh the training
that's broken or the uh the training
here like the prams I'm doing a little
here like the prams I'm doing a little
bit of it manually to get a sense for
bit of it manually to get a sense for
things like it is suspicious that this
things like it is suspicious that this
is still not looking particularly stable
is still not looking particularly stable
here I give it a little bit longer it
here I give it a little bit longer it
looks
looks
like n it's not really learning
like n it's not really learning
anything this is a very simple problem
anything this is a very simple problem
with a very nice reward so it should
with a very nice reward so it should
basically learn instantly is the
thing
thing
yeah they do something weird
n batch size is
n batch size is
one shouldn't this be
four oh no it should be uh it should be
four oh no it should be uh it should be
two shouldn't
two shouldn't
it yeah we
it yeah we
want probably this
okay so now the next question is going
okay so now the next question is going
to be why is this not
to be why is this not
stable learning does not appear to be
stable learning does not appear to be
particularly stable
you literally you get positive reward if
you literally you get positive reward if
you just don't press
anything you get negative reward if you
anything you get negative reward if you
press
up don't
up don't
you all right let's uh let's make it a
you all right let's uh let's make it a
little let's make it a little simpler
right make it a little simpler
I think this is
up what if we do
up what if we do
this it literally has a button to press
this it literally has a button to press
and has to learn to not press
it I'm giving it a I'm giving it like a
it I'm giving it a I'm giving it like a
very trivial task because basically if
very trivial task because basically if
this doesn't work it's very likely
this doesn't work it's very likely
something is like screwed up with the
something is like screwed up with the
data
somehow yeah so this is like this is
somehow yeah so this is like this is
bizarre um this curve this is like
bizarre um this curve this is like
something fundamentally
screwy RL is actually pretty sane once
screwy RL is actually pretty sane once
um you get stuff set up
um you get stuff set up
correctly so
yeah no this is no
good okay we have a few things to check
good okay we have a few things to check
here um so the first thing
is going to be to run
eval eval a random
eval eval a random
policy see what it
policy see what it
[Music]
does and it presses up too much I guess
does and it presses up too much I guess
right and then if I do it again with
right and then if I do it again with
this being off
it casually floats back down to earth
it casually floats back down to earth
and gets good reward
and gets good reward
right yeah start going up oh wait why is
right yeah start going up oh wait why is
it
negative did I forget to
rebuild that's
Jank you see the reward being negative
Jank you see the reward being negative
here this uh this does not make sense it
here this uh this does not make sense it
should be getting positive reward right
now ooh do I not have the
now ooh do I not have the
file I guess I have not been rebuilding
file I guess I have not been rebuilding
the environment with the the python
the environment with the the python
version that would do it
to figure out how to do uh the Box 2D
to figure out how to do uh the Box 2D
include now aren't
I box
I box
2D runtime Library do
should be
include okay did that
include okay did that
work looks like
work looks like
it now if I run eval do we get positive
it now if I run eval do we get positive
reward yes we do get positive
reward yes we do get positive
reward so now hopefully we can actually
reward so now hopefully we can actually
train it
right just double check one other thing
right just double check one other thing
just make sure that this number here
just make sure that this number here
prints out is positive
oh no because it's it's a random policy
oh no because it's it's a random policy
that's fine
though okay so we'll let this
train and hopefully this should decrease
train and hopefully this should decrease
yep look at
yep look at
that new reward curve
it literally was for once it was a
it literally was for once it was a
fundamental RL
fundamental RL
thing it was a fundamental screw up with
thing it was a fundamental screw up with
the
the
uh with the way that we were specifying
uh with the way that we were specifying
rewards
rewards
cool we'll wait for this to Output a a
cool we'll wait for this to Output a a
checkpoint of some
sort an error
action
space SP
spaces using continuous space
no we definitely support continuous
no we definitely support continuous
bases
h
I see
is this
is this
collapsing no it's just it's idling okay
collapsing no it's just it's idling okay
this is good
it's
this is going to be the world's most
this is going to be the world's most
boring policy to start
with checkpoint saved it update 100
right so what we're going to do is we're
right so what we're going to do is we're
going to watch the policy back and it
going to watch the policy back and it
shouldn't be doing anything so actually
shouldn't be doing anything so actually
ironically if it's not doing
ironically if it's not doing
anything uh then it is actually learned
anything uh then it is actually learned
correctly
correctly
because it literally just needs to drift
because it literally just needs to drift
down to earth to start
with huh ironically it seems to have
with huh ironically it seems to have
found that it's able to just
spin
spin
also reward can be
also reward can be
Amplified the more close it is like
interpolation also reward can be
interpolation also reward can be
Amplified there are many ways to set
Amplified there are many ways to set
stuff up
stuff up
um I don't think that there's any reason
um I don't think that there's any reason
to have to do that like you don't need
to have to do that like you don't need
to you should not need to increase the
to you should not need to increase the
reward the closer it gets it just needs
reward the closer it gets it just needs
to have a reward for getting closer the
to have a reward for getting closer the
thing that I did before that didn't work
thing that I did before that didn't work
at all this actually works substantially
at all this actually works substantially
better by comparison though kind of
better by comparison though kind of
confused why it doesn't um
me
see do I have my rewards backwards or
something I think I got my rewards
something I think I got my rewards
backwards seeing stuff from 20 minutes
backwards seeing stuff from 20 minutes
ago oh yeah the uh the main thing that
ago oh yeah the uh the main thing that
was happening though before that was
was happening though before that was
preventing it from doing anything was
preventing it from doing anything was
um the reward structure it's a very easy
um the reward structure it's a very easy
to screw up continuous rewards you kind
to screw up continuous rewards you kind
of want to have rewards be expressed as
of want to have rewards be expressed as
a Delta so like if I get closer I get a
a Delta so like if I get closer I get a
reward not I get a reward based on my
reward not I get a reward based on my
distance it's interesting that it's
distance it's interesting that it's
actually getting some positive reward
actually getting some positive reward
for what it's doing here probably means
for what it's doing here probably means
I just have misspecified the reward more
I just have misspecified the reward more
than anything
but now we can uh we can build it and we
but now we can uh we can build it and we
can play
it can build it and we can play
it see doesn't actually show reward for
it see doesn't actually show reward for
for
this we'll rebuild it and print the
this we'll rebuild it and print the
rewards
out okay
out okay
so we're getting positive reward for
so we're getting positive reward for
what we're doing
what we're doing
here gets negative reward if we do this
here gets negative reward if we do this
right
can see you're getting negative reward
can see you're getting negative reward
by doing
stuff yeah it should be able to get
stuff yeah it should be able to get
positive reward not just
positive reward not just
negative but look at our train curve for
negative but look at our train curve for
this
thing oh oh it actually look it got it
thing oh oh it actually look it got it
and then something
and then something
happened it got a a KL
happened it got a a KL
Spike
Spike
interesting so they're actually it did
interesting so they're actually it did
solve it and then it uh it got
solve it and then it uh it got
destabilized somehow
that's
interesting I mean I have what looked
interesting I mean I have what looked
like very stable
parameters what if
rewarding if the direction vector
rewarding if the direction vector
is pointing to the
is pointing to the
objective yeah you can do something like
objective yeah you can do something like
that uh this is like debugging very
that uh this is like debugging very
basic things here there are lots of
basic things here there are lots of
things that we can do better here um and
things that we can do better here um and
actually ironically this is a problem
actually ironically this is a problem
where you're allowed to mess with the
where you're allowed to mess with the
rewards right because you're allowed to
rewards right because you're allowed to
make rewards based on like physical
make rewards based on like physical
orientation of the rocket like you would
orientation of the rocket like you would
be able to do that in the real rocket
be able to do that in the real rocket
problem
problem
right that's very easy to
do I don't know why this is set to
four I think that makes a
four I think that makes a

Gamma and set this
Gamma and set this

to 10
mil 20
mil let's comment this
thing and see if it learns now and after
thing and see if it learns now and after
that we're going to give it a much
that we're going to give it a much
harder task
okay so this is going to train for a
okay so this is going to train for a
couple minutes I'm going to go grab
couple minutes I'm going to go grab
myself a cup of tea and
myself a cup of tea and
um then we're going to actually make
um then we're going to actually make
this be the full task hopefully be right
this be the full task hopefully be right

sweep to see the physics that's what I'm
sweep to see the physics that's what I'm
doing yeah that's what I'm doing here is
doing yeah that's what I'm doing here is
because just yeah the the solution is
because just yeah the the solution is
usually to run a sweep but only when you
usually to run a sweep but only when you
think that you have the environment
think that you have the environment
mostly figured out there's like a ton of
mostly figured out there's like a ton of
Jank physic stuff going on
here okay so what happened now
here okay so what happened now
um there's like instability in learning
um there's like instability in learning
there's instability with physics there's
there's instability with physics there's
like lots of weird stuff going
like lots of weird stuff going
on so this is what we just did
it's just not learning a very good
policy and it's not very
policy and it's not very
stable I don't know
stable I don't know
why is it just like learning rate or
something do I have some dumb parameter
something do I have some dumb parameter
here that I'm not
seeing
seeing
48 a giant batch of
48 a giant batch of
data actually do we even have a big
data actually do we even have a big
enough batch hold on this might be it so
enough batch hold on this might be it so
was it 2 18 maybe yeah over
was it 2 18 maybe yeah over
8192 so only 32 yeah this is kind of
small is this going to even slow it down
small is this going to even slow it down
if I just do this
what if I do V multiprocessing
here
two batch size must be
divisible num M's

this kind of just doing this in the
background please do remember to start
background please do remember to start
the puffer repository it really helps us
let's see does anybody actually start it
let's see does anybody actually start it
today oh yeah it's gotten like an extra
today oh yeah it's gotten like an extra
like 10 15 Stars
like 10 15 Stars
today look at that nice little
today look at that nice little
uptick that's
great the only uh growth metrics I track
great the only uh growth metrics I track
are stars on the repo and followers on x
I'm going to have to shift over to
I'm going to have to shift over to
tracking MMR mrr
tracking MMR mrr
eventually
eventually
um but for now we're kind of just
um but for now we're kind of just
chilling the open source is
good so is it getting unstable here
good so is it getting unstable here
what's going
on why does it get stuck around zero you
on why does it get stuck around zero you
know
kind of weird how this policy
kind of weird how this policy
is I trained it at 260k so that's a nice
is I trained it at 260k so that's a nice
that's a nice speed bump at
least so we can actually run physic Sims
least so we can actually run physic Sims
very quickly in fact I know we can go
very quickly in fact I know we can go
even faster than that as
even faster than that as
well why does it get stuck around here
well why does it get stuck around here
it really I can't think of any reason
it really I can't think of any reason
reason it should get stuck except that
reason it should get stuck except that
the policy seems to become
the policy seems to become
unstable what would make the policy
unstable I could just be
unstable I could just be
hypers what
hypers what
is it yes it theck roet just spawning on
is it yes it theck roet just spawning on
the same spot and if the rocket goes too
the same spot and if the rocket goes too
far off the screen it gets
far off the screen it gets
reset should be pretty
reset should be pretty
simple so I would like to see it solve
simple so I would like to see it solve
this like very easy
this like very easy
problem it doesn't even have to do
problem it doesn't even have to do
anything it just has to turn off all its
anything it just has to turn off all its
engines and gently drift to the ground
gra me crazy
this reward skill should be decent as
well it's possible the reward scale got
well it's possible the reward scale got
to be too
to be too
large for something this dense I doubt
it I mean I'll try this just in case cuz
it I mean I'll try this just in case cuz
this is quick
anyways oh and now would be a good time
anyways oh and now would be a good time
to
yes there's a way
still
still
negative is it
negative is it
um let's see if it's more stable
n it's about the
n it's about the
same it's about the same as
same it's about the same as
before I don't like how these stats
before I don't like how these stats
explode like this it's kind of
explode like this it's kind of
weird right for this policy to be like
this that's actually very
odd learning rate is nice and low
got a nice big batch of
got a nice big batch of
data I don't see any parameters that
data I don't see any parameters that
could cause instability
here yeah I don't see
anything I'm trying to think what I
anything I'm trying to think what I
could be missing
answer some stuff in the meantime
oh cuz it's
Mouse for
not
this do I like is the learning rate just
this do I like is the learning rate just
massively too high or
something at least these experiments are
something at least these experiments are
very
very
quick I have a couple things to do in
quick I have a couple things to do in
the meantime before I have to think too
the meantime before I have to think too
hard about it
this is awesome
so many people we've got like 10
so many people we've got like 10
different people today they're all like
different people today they're all like
wanting to hop in
so so so so many people that's great
so so so so many people that's great
it's really really
great I mean for all of its faults X is
great I mean for all of its faults X is

a really good platform for

this morning was kind of tired felt like
this morning was kind of tired felt like
going on a tweet storm and now we've got
going on a tweet storm and now we've got
10 new people hopping into the Discord

which I took literally enough that I
which I took literally enough that I
bought a bunch of lava lamps in
bought a bunch of lava lamps in
undergrad I had some great blunder
years okay so this thing is still not
years okay so this thing is still not
getting positive reward somehow which is
getting positive reward somehow which is
very
very
odd um it's a very easy to learn
odd um it's a very easy to learn
task let me see previous
X oh wait am I stupid
yeah this
says this is rewarding you based on
says this is rewarding you based on
distance from previous yeah this is
distance from previous yeah this is
insane isn't it hold
on two
oh wait is this
correct is this correct
um actually no I this is correct isn't
um actually no I this is correct isn't
it you get rewarded for decreasing the
it you get rewarded for decreasing the
magnitude of X or
Y
Y
yeah so this should be fine
um things that bother me are the
um things that bother me are the
stability of the training
stability of the training
runs but it really should be able to
runs but it really should be able to
solve something like this like this is
solve something like this like this is
very very
very very
easy
um curious how it gets to nearly
um curious how it gets to nearly
zero as well
is there a reason for
that I actually and I saw it Spike up to
that I actually and I saw it Spike up to
like 30 or something as
like 30 or something as
well it just wasn't
well it just wasn't
stable there a reason that it wasn't
stable there a reason that it wasn't
stable
stable
oops I do this this reward like this
oops I do this this reward like this
extra reward messing with it somehow
look at all these new people
good
good
progress oh
why value
loss a value loss gets
loss a value loss gets
learned
no what is it that getting stuck around
zero trying to think what it is that's
zero trying to think what it is that's
getting
getting
stuck around
zero for
a weird
model that definitely shouldn't be
model that definitely shouldn't be
getting positive reward
hold on I think that there's probably
hold on I think that there's probably
something that I'm not understanding
something that I'm not understanding
with like the
with like the
rotation let me just see real quick if
rotation let me just see real quick if
this works if this doesn't work then
this works if this doesn't work then
there's something seriously
wrong literally just has to learn to not
wrong literally just has to learn to not
engage
thrusters e
still not
learning is this like entropy screwing
learning is this like entropy screwing
us over or something
I'd be surprised if something that small
I'd be surprised if something that small
if the entropy coefficient that small
if the entropy coefficient that small
was messing with
us guess stranger things have
happened I'd be very surprised though
yeah that wasn't a magical fix
there's like something that I'm missing
there's like something that I'm missing
here it gets reset on
step this
and that's just one step it really
and that's just one step it really
shouldn't make a difference

watch it play the
environment this is one of the reasons
environment this is one of the reasons
that we like games so much is because
that we like games so much is because
they are visually
interpretable I mean the thing that's
interpretable I mean the thing that's
going to happen EV here right is
going to happen EV here right is
like we're going to have a whole bunch
like we're going to have a whole bunch
of M that are super fast and that we
of M that are super fast and that we
know are good so if you mess with your
know are good so if you mess with your
algorithm you know you're going to be
algorithm you know you're going to be
able to know for sure whether you just
able to know for sure whether you just
broke your training code or something
broke your training code or something
fundamental because you're going to be
fundamental because you're going to be
able to train on known good environments
able to train on known good environments
incredibly
quickly right now in RL we have known
quickly right now in RL we have known
good environments but they're very
good environments but they're very
slow the ones that are fast are very
slow the ones that are fast are very
very simple like even simpler than pong
very simple like even simpler than pong
and breakout for the most part people
and breakout for the most part people
have like these really really dumb
have like these really really dumb
simple
environments e
put back the entropy
let me play the en
again obnoxious physic
s I'm not going to spend all day doing
s I'm not going to spend all day doing
this Z is not that that
this Z is not that that
important but I would like to get
important but I would like to get
something
something
whoops
okay it would be nice to have a
okay it would be nice to have a
physics of some
type you know I am noticing like
it's just very high
it's just very high
frequency hello could I ask an unrelated

looking for grid World cart pole stuff
looking for grid World cart pole stuff
to start yeah puffer is the place
to start yeah puffer is the place
probably for that um cuz we have some
probably for that um cuz we have some
M's that are like very fast our pong en
M's that are like very fast our pong en
I think our pong en is probably a good
I think our pong en is probably a good
one to train right let's say
my train back
my train back
native okay let's just train pong live
native okay let's just train pong live
for
you we've got a little CNN lstm type
you we've got a little CNN lstm type
model
here and do our stats not
here and do our stats not
work I think our stats should
work I'm not seeing any stats
oh yep there they go they're just very
sparse okay so there you go 35 seconds
sparse okay so there you go 35 seconds
and pong is
and pong is
solved
solved
right oh no no no no it isn't my bad
right oh no no no no it isn't my bad
this is episode reward okay I forgot I
this is episode reward okay I forgot I
uh we haven't tuned it yet so the hyper
uh we haven't tuned it yet so the hyper
parameters are terrible I'm sure we will
parameters are terrible I'm sure we will
solve it in 30 seconds because we've
solve it in 30 seconds because we've
basically done that before
basically done that before
um hold on pong has a really weird
um hold on pong has a really weird
learning
learning
curve you'll
see okay so here's this rep episode
see okay so here's this rep episode
return here's episode
return here's episode
score pong has like this takeoff curve
score pong has like this takeoff curve
with learning
come
on should way be solved by
now apparently I broke it with one of
now apparently I broke it with one of
the updates that's obnoxious which is
the updates that's obnoxious which is
very weird because we actually have it
very weird because we actually have it
deployed on the website
um I'm trying to think should I try
um I'm trying to think should I try
breakout
breakout
instead I'm could do
instead I'm could do
breakout I did also just mess with
breakout I did also just mess with
breakout
though
oh I think it
recovers yeah there it goes okay it
recovers yeah there it goes okay it
recovered
recovered
so we don't have amazing hyper
so we don't have amazing hyper
parameters tuned for this thing um but
parameters tuned for this thing um but
I'm just training this locally on my
I'm just training this locally on my
desktop here
and I guess it wasn't very stable this
and I guess it wasn't very stable this
run let me find you something better so
run let me find you something better so
if you wanted to literally train cart
pole so this is cart Pole
yeah so there's like some little hitch
yeah so there's like some little hitch
here otherwise it would have gone
here otherwise it would have gone
straight um here's cart pole being
straight um here's cart pole being
optimized I think like 100 or 200 or
optimized I think like 100 or 200 or
whatever is the intended target so
whatever is the intended target so
cartpole you just solve it very quickly
cartpole you just solve it very quickly
no problem
there remaining 30 seconds okay we'll
there remaining 30 seconds okay we'll
just let this train and then we'll show
just let this train and then we'll show
you the policy if that rendering
Works
Works
70 very helpful did not no scope of
70 very helpful did not no scope of
puffer so the fun thing with puffer is
puffer so the fun thing with puffer is
like you see me running this command
like you see me running this command
like this just to train but um it's not
like this just to train but um it's not
like sb3 the code is very transparent so
like sb3 the code is very transparent so
you can actually see all the training
you can actually see all the training
code very very easily and find where
code very very easily and find where
everything is and how everything works
everything is and how everything works
it's not meant to be a black boox thing
it's not meant to be a black boox thing
it's yeah so
like
EV hold
on and see if this is good

eval you see I got the ARG wrong and it
eval you see I got the ARG wrong and it
tells me that it gives me all the args
tells me that it gives me all the args
that you that are valid I just wrote it
that you that are valid I just wrote it
wrong okay and here's cartpole here's
wrong okay and here's cartpole here's
the model that we just
trained now now pong should literally
trained now now pong should literally
train in the amount of time that I
train in the amount of time that I
showed you before um we haven't done a
showed you before um we haven't done a
proper sweep I guess on that that's kind
proper sweep I guess on that that's kind
of
of
embarrassing Let's do let's do our
embarrassing Let's do let's do our
breakout let's see if I didn't break
that all these Ms are in Dev right so
that all these Ms are in Dev right so
like the new ones are uh not always the
like the new ones are uh not always the
most
most
stable that's one of the things we're
stable that's one of the things we're
trying to get all these contributors to
trying to get all these contributors to
help us
help us
fix but breakout I think should at least
fix but breakout I think should at least
have a consistent learn
have a consistent learn
curve okay yeah so here we
curve okay yeah so here we
go come on
there we go yeah there we go now it
there we go yeah there we go now it
takes off
um
um
just okay so now this is training
just okay so now this is training
breakout
breakout
live and we actually have the policies
live and we actually have the policies
deployed online for these like the
deployed online for these like the
pre-train policies
so you can actually watch the agent play
so you can actually watch the agent play
Breakout this is one that we trained
Breakout this is one that we trained
before it just plays in your browser
before it just plays in your browser
this is running live in your browser as
well like the network as well is just
well like the network as well is just
running
running
locally we also have the pong
locally we also have the pong
one this is if you actually train the
one this is if you actually train the
pong with you know better hyper prams or
whatever and we have some other things
whatever and we have some other things
as
as
well so lots of M's
well so lots of M's
there going to be more M we could
there going to be more M we could
definitely use help with them uh
definitely use help with them uh

in the track Mania video I like how they
in the track Mania video I like how they
display multiple agents and watch them
evolve I know this only happens post
evolve I know this only happens post
training yeah I mean if we if we have
training yeah I mean if we if we have
people that want to help us make cooler
people that want to help us make cooler
visualizations that would be great
yeah we definitely need better hyper
yeah we definitely need better hyper
prams for our simple M's cuz like our
prams for our simple M's cuz like our
breakout and our pong should both be
breakout and our pong should both be

whatever if you want to contribute stuff
whatever if you want to contribute stuff
and then all the dependencies are
and then all the dependencies are
handled and you don't have to deal with
handled and you don't have to deal with
that stuff dependency Management in
that stuff dependency Management in
Python is
terrible and you have active support
terrible and you have active support
available in the Discord
available in the Discord
also um I will tell you that like if
also um I will tell you that like if
you're doing all this course stuff it's
you're doing all this course stuff it's
good to learn things but like you
good to learn things but like you
probably actually have more than enough
probably actually have more than enough
um like background to actually be doing
um like background to actually be doing
productive work already um people will
productive work already um people will
be surprised to know I never read an RL
be surprised to know I never read an RL
textbook I also didn't ever take an RL
textbook I also didn't ever take an RL
course they didn't exist when I was um
course they didn't exist when I was um
you know doing my undergrad and stuff at
you know doing my undergrad and stuff at
the time there were not any courses I
the time there were not any courses I
guess there were some books still um but
guess there were some books still um but
for the most part I read a bunch of
for the most part I read a bunch of
papers and I did a bunch of
papers and I did a bunch of
RL and yeah there's some Theory stuff in
RL and yeah there's some Theory stuff in
there right that's kind of important but
there right that's kind of important but
also like half the time in RL you like
also like half the time in RL you like
make some weird approximation to the
make some weird approximation to the
algorithm and it ends up just being
algorithm and it ends up just being
faster and better um RL is a heavily
faster and better um RL is a heavily
heavily empirical
heavily empirical
science so yeah I don't know I would
science so yeah I don't know I would
just I would generally suggest people
just I would generally suggest people
just like getting involved and helping
just like getting involved and helping
with this stuff cuz like the reason that
with this stuff cuz like the reason that
RL is in such a bad place at the moment
RL is in such a bad place at the moment
is just purely because we never built
is just purely because we never built
fast and easy tools environments and
fast and easy tools environments and
infrastructure so that's what I'm
infrastructure so that's what I'm
approaching at the
moment like actually my playbook for
moment like actually my playbook for
most of my Dev it's 80%
most of my Dev it's 80%
engineering 15% like basic scientific
engineering 15% like basic scientific
method experiments and stuff and May
method experiments and stuff and May
maybe 5%
math so really I mean the main thing is
math so really I mean the main thing is
just for people to like start getting
just for people to like start getting
involved in like um you know taking on
involved in like um you know taking on
little environment projects shipping
little environment projects shipping
environment
environment
code as soon as we get a big enough
code as soon as we get a big enough
repository of like very nice fast and
repository of like very nice fast and
stable environments the whole field is
stable environments the whole field is
going to just be completely revamped
going to just be completely revamped
revamped because you're going to be able
revamped because you're going to be able
to get comprehensive experiment
to get comprehensive experiment
results across like 10 different
results across like 10 different
environments on one GPU in a day that's
environments on one GPU in a day that's
something that you cannot do at all at
something that you cannot do at all at
the moment in RL so you can be a lot
the moment in RL so you can be a lot
stupider about how you do things when
stupider about how you do things when
things are just fast enough for you to
things are just fast enough for you to
run all the experiments that you'd ever
want that's very much the way I look at
things where's this rocket Lander in
things where's this rocket Lander in
that's giving me
grief it's so weird that this is
grief it's so weird that this is
not oh wait yeah yeah we actually just
not oh wait yeah yeah we actually just
came up with a a thing here on this
came up with a a thing here on this
right let me see
what if I do like this oops one over
what if I do like this oops one over
10 then I do 24 sub steps do this work
okay so now the m is way faster it's
okay so now the m is way faster it's
actually funny that that feels
better puffers are resident Advertiser
bet is our resident Advertiser I
mean you called me puffer I am honored
mean you called me puffer I am honored
yeah I thought I did that but I wasn't
yeah I thought I did that but I wasn't
positive dude I swear I just like I fill
positive dude I swear I just like I fill
my head with so much crap doing all like
my head with so much crap doing all like
the Social Media stuff for puffer and
the Social Media stuff for puffer and
all the dev and all the reviews and
all the dev and all the reviews and
stuff I just end up cooking my brain
stuff I just end up cooking my brain
halfway through the
week start thank you for the
sport cook from this
run I've been doing um I think I did
run I've been doing um I think I did
like a
like a
924 paac is 5K this morning
I don't know I haven't been going fast
I don't know I haven't been going fast
too fast with the runs lately because
too fast with the runs lately because
it's mostly a strength
it's mostly a strength
block now 924 is considered quite
slow but I pulled 405 earlier this week
so the strength is
back yeah the running is not not too
back yeah the running is not not too
fun fitness very important
though next goal is going to be 1,000
though next goal is going to be 1,000
total and then after that it's going to
total and then after that it's going to
be th total and be running a
marathon because I'm slightly under
marathon because I'm slightly under
Marathon shape at the
Marathon shape at the
moment I'd have to do like um maybe five
moment I'd have to do like um maybe five
six week block to get back get my uh my
six week block to get back get my uh my
endurance back to from like half
endurance back to from like half
marathon to Marathon
[Music]
distance got to keep at
distance got to keep at
it okay I'm just why does this thing not
work like okay here hold on
work like okay here hold on
if
I okay here we have our rocket Lander M
I okay here we have our rocket Lander M
now
now
okay okay here's our rocket Lander
end it's kind of crazy how long the
end it's kind of crazy how long the
Horizon is on these t tasks right like I
Horizon is on these t tasks right like I
think the reward function is just shitty
think the reward function is just shitty
like you just take one action you press
like you just take one action you press
the key once and you see it shifts your
the key once and you see it shifts your
reward for like the next 30
steps it's probably all it is
I don't think it's anything fundamental
I don't think it's anything fundamental
with the algorithm actually
okay
idea what if I did
idea what if I did
this is this like bat
crazy last question is now you can ask
crazy last question is now you can ask
questions steering llm Behavior via RL
questions steering llm Behavior via RL
kind of within the culture fit for
kind of within the culture fit for
deing V so not really and let me tell
deing V so not really and let me tell
you
you
why the side of RL that I'm approaching
why the side of RL that I'm approaching
at the moment right the side of RL that
at the moment right the side of RL that
we're looking at is high throughput
we're looking at is high throughput
simulation anything to do it's not just
simulation anything to do it's not just
games either right anything that you can

simulate fast so virtually get unlimited
simulate fast so virtually get unlimited
data the reason this is what we're
data the reason this is what we're
looking at is because it's a very
looking at is because it's a very
underinvested area of research it's one
underinvested area of research it's one
that's likely to be important for
that's likely to be important for
long-term progress in AI because there
long-term progress in AI because there
are a lot of problems that don't mesh
are a lot of problems that don't mesh
well with LMS where you do have lots of
well with LMS where you do have lots of
data uh and it fundamentally scales in a
data uh and it fundamentally scales in a
way that is different from llms like you
way that is different from llms like you
end up using tons and tons of data with
end up using tons and tons of data with
not much compute and not many parameters
not much compute and not many parameters
versus llms that end up using a ton of
versus llms that end up using a ton of
Compu and a ton of parameters with not
Compu and a ton of parameters with not
much
much
data um I do think that there is a place
data um I do think that there is a place
for llm with RL like a tie-in but the
for llm with RL like a tie-in but the
key for that is going to be you're going
key for that is going to be you're going
to have to have a small policy that the
to have to have a small policy that the
LM is mostly letting do the work and
LM is mostly letting do the work and
then once in a while when there's like a
then once in a while when there's like a
highle decision to be made then the llm
highle decision to be made then the llm
can take over the work a lot like how
can take over the work a lot like how
I'm not actively thinking about where
I'm not actively thinking about where
I'm moving my hands and stuff right now
I'm moving my hands and stuff right now
it's kind of just like
it's kind of just like
automatic you want RL to take the
automatic you want RL to take the
automatic portion
automatic portion
um yeah that's kind of the main area
um yeah that's kind of the main area
that's going to be like a future
that's going to be like a future
research thing but at the moment we're
research thing but at the moment we're
mostly looking at High throughput Sim in
mostly looking at High throughput Sim in
that area of things which to be fair is
that area of things which to be fair is
an area that you can actually make a
an area that you can actually make a
difference in without having to have a

gigantic
cluster Iceberg video should be a very
cluster Iceberg video should be a very
good primer on RL and where I see the
good primer on RL and where I see the
field going and such it's exciting to me
field going and such it's exciting to me
because this is a space where there
because this is a space where there
really aren't a lot of people doing this
really aren't a lot of people doing this
stuff so like this literally will not
stuff so like this literally will not
get done um if I don't do it in puffer
get done um if I don't do it in puffer
so tremendous chance for impact on the
so tremendous chance for impact on the
science of it and also you can do this
science of it and also you can do this
stuff at pretty darn low compute
stuff at pretty darn low compute
resource scale um pretty much anybody

can just like code up an interesting
can just like code up an interesting

contribute massively to the

ah
ah
okay
so I'm curious to see if this is going
so I'm curious to see if this is going
to work just you know for the sake of it
to work just you know for the sake of it

I have a project in mind there as well

that's going to be like still building

bright the biggest thing though right

now like in the short term in my mind I
now like in the short term in my mind I
really want to ship 1.1 as an official
really want to ship 1.1 as an official
update like as soon as possible ideally
update like as soon as possible ideally
I'd like to ship it in the next couple
I'd like to ship it in the next couple
weeks before I go back to Florida um
weeks before I go back to Florida um
which means having like the 10 stable
which means having like the 10 stable
environments and baselines and all that
environments and baselines and all that
stuff it's just God so much work
H so so much
work okay seriously what is wrong with
work okay seriously what is wrong with
these
environments for
I have it
zero for
like bothering me that I can't figure
like bothering me that I can't figure
out why this is so
screwy like this one shouldn't be that
screwy like this one shouldn't be that
complicated I wouldn't
think what happened here
policy doesn't make any freaking sense
see okay you know what we're going to
see okay you know what we're going to
do we're going to be a little more
do we're going to be a little more
pragmatic about this
[Music]
go like this
we're going to just see if we can train
we're going to just see if we can train
it to learn a single fixed action
it to learn a single fixed action
because I think that there's a bug
why is it still 33
oh because I didn't the
time
time
on what did we set this to
episode return is zero
can it not output zero or
something yeah something's definitely
something yeah something's definitely
screwy
screwy
here oh I wonder if it's the same bug
here oh I wonder if it's the same bug
from before
from before
actually that'd be real embarrassing
actually that'd be real embarrassing
wouldn't
wouldn't
it hold on
load actions
oh
oh
wait I mess up
wait I mess up
massively I messed up massively didn't
I I messed up massively hold on I found
I I messed up massively hold on I found
it yeah this is guaranteed it
what is it hold
on
Lo got to be this right
for e
so we have
actions rewards look
actions rewards look
good so why
oh is it just not getting log pulled on
yeah I will fix this thing
yeah I will fix this thing
even if it ends up being something very
silly I hate how this uh automatically
silly I hate how this uh automatically
indents for
you
zero I I really don't care if this makes
zero I I really don't care if this makes
me look stupid like I'm I'm going to
me look stupid like I'm I'm going to
find this stupid bug and I'm going to
find this stupid bug and I'm going to
fix it it's going to be some dumb data
fix it it's going to be some dumb data
thing
guaranteed
okay I mean one of the reasons I am so
okay I mean one of the reasons I am so
incredibly insistent on the RL code
incredibly insistent on the RL code
bases being like simple simple simple
bases being like simple simple simple
simple including the like the
simple including the like the
environments including the training

including everything is because RL is

kind of cursed and stuff will go wrong
kind of cursed and stuff will go wrong
and it will go horribly wrong like you
and it will go horribly wrong like you
do not want to be waiting through five
do not want to be waiting through five
layers of fang
layers of fang
abstractions in RL you just don't it's
abstractions in RL you just don't it's
not a good time trust me
no
okay there we go so
why is episode length
one all right there's more stuff to find
one all right there's more stuff to find
here I'm going to be right back grab
here I'm going to be right back grab
more tea use the restro and then we're
more tea use the restro and then we're
going to fix this um do we have anything
going to fix this um do we have anything
else toly to
that's
funny Kung made a little
page that guy need some assistance uh I
page that guy need some assistance uh I
think he was asking for like a
think he was asking for like a
substantial feature for stuff I'll be
substantial feature for stuff I'll be
right back
right back
though
e
e
e
e
e
e
e e
uhoh and not knock that not knock that
over hi welcome
that's
funny it made like some react app that's
funny it made like some react app that's
so silly
wait it actually went up it trained
wait it actually went up it trained
more that's
more that's
bizarre let's figure out why
um me figure something out here
okay rocket
okay rocket
[Music]
Lander oh it's cuz literally nothing
Lander oh it's cuz literally nothing
happens question
happens question
mark That's
mark That's
render FPS
why do nothing
happen reset
something is just like bizarre
here what
rewind
321 uh reward
oh wait we didn't I messed this up
oh wait we didn't I messed this up
didn't
I okay so here we have rocket Lander
I okay so here we have rocket Lander
which is constantly resetting
transform
transform
Y is
uh how's that make any sense where do I
uh how's that make any sense where do I
start
start
it where's the initial position
initial
initial
y it's 500
right transform equal
pause 500 so you get the Lander
ID the rust
scale oh is it just just like launching
scale oh is it just just like launching
it I'm
it I'm
confused let's
do
zero thank you to bet our resident
zero thank you to bet our resident
advertising
here most amusing bet do star the puffer
here most amusing bet do star the puffer
star the repo helps me out a lot
okay so somehow this transform is
okay so somehow this transform is
completely
bonked is it 120 like
how how is it
how how is it
120 reset
why is this transform like
why is this transform like
so messed
up Lander ID
it's Lander ID not uh barge ID right
evening extremely
weird am I just not understanding
weird am I just not understanding
something about how
something about how
um how this physics engine works or is
um how this physics engine works or is
it just glitchy or like what
just do like
this it did not
compile compute observations
you have to do like this don't
you how does this transform go
okay so
pause so when you step
pause so when you step
this did I mess up the step function
this did I mess up the step function
hold
on I'd really just like to have this
on I'd really just like to have this
working today because
working today because
um there's somebody who hopefully is
um there's somebody who hopefully is
going to help on this over the weekend
going to help on this over the weekend
and I'd like to have um a basic demo I
and I'd like to have um a basic demo I
don't want to just be fighting with
don't want to just be fighting with
something totally cursed I mean the
something totally cursed I mean the
really the goal is to just have this
really the goal is to just have this
thing just do something basic today and
thing just do something basic today and
then also maybe fix up the rendering so
then also maybe fix up the rendering so
it looks kind of
it looks kind of
cool I should be able to get it done if
cool I should be able to get it done if
I don't get just stuck on this all
I don't get just stuck on this all
day and it's really kind of
day and it's really kind of
silly there rocket Lander
was all in
was all in
C oh do I not have any of this
C oh do I not have any of this
committed I should probably do
committed I should probably do
that let's commit up all code real quick
oh was it one over oh I know what I know
oh was it one over oh I know what I know
what it is I'm just dumb okay
okay I remember rocket Lander that's
okay I remember rocket Lander that's
what I'm doing right now is I'm trying
what I'm doing right now is I'm trying
to fix that
to fix that
project
okay okay I think this is back to
normal just
normal just
falling now balls very
falling now balls very
slowly and make it yep
slowly and make it yep
I'm so
I'm so
now get rid of these print
TS and set
up and we can run the sanity check to
up and we can run the sanity check to
see if it actually can learn to just
see if it actually can learn to just
like press a button or if I have
like press a button or if I have
something fundamentally wrong with the
something fundamentally wrong with the
the bindings
something appears fundamentally wrong
not learning to press a
button value loss
is very
high well actually now it learned kind
high well actually now it learned kind
of yeah so why wait why the heck was
of yeah so why wait why the heck was
that so
hard I'm kind of suspicious of this
and the fact that the value loss is so
and the fact that the value loss is so
messed up
actions of zero
what do we get we get float
actions I through I +
1 and then you pass float
1 and then you pass float
actions which is num

wrong with this
crazy rocket end
[Music]
okay so on
here seems to
here seems to
work these are normal leaks that's fine
perf
test looks good
test looks good
500k uh and you also you're not
500k uh and you also you're not
compiling this in fast mode mod either
compiling this in fast mode mod either
so you're actually it's 500k on slow
so you're actually it's 500k on slow
mode probably way faster on fast mode
huh a dress sanitizer takes a lot of
huh a dress sanitizer takes a lot of
time apparently not in this case that's

very weird never seen that
before um well whatever
and then let's
see training supposed to seg fold
immediately unless this didn't
immediately unless this didn't
compile
see works for
see works for
you looks like it
seg fult straight away from
me that's pretty
weird uh
that's very
weird yeah just like I can run it and
weird yeah just like I can run it and
play
it I'm kind of curious to
it I'm kind of curious to
see what was this thre mil
see what was this thre mil
this train is very
this train is very
slow so I'm actually suspicious as to
slow so I'm actually suspicious as to
whether it's compiling
correctly NE
four hold on I'm a little suspicious
four hold on I'm a little suspicious
because uh it doesn't seem to be running
because uh it doesn't seem to be running
as fast as it should be it's like
as fast as it should be it's like
running with like the speed of the old
running with like the speed of the old

like
like
I 20
yeah 59 60% M

time
try oh well hold on should be two and
two processing
M doesn't appear to be quite
M doesn't appear to be quite
fast but
fast but
uh say 48% M
uh say 48% M
time faster on my
MacBook well we're at 430k
now trying to figure out here let's do
now trying to figure out here let's do
cuz I'm not sure that this is actually
cuz I'm not sure that this is actually
being compiled
being compiled
correctly going to do print F
step let's see if this is actually
compiling yep it is compiling so we're
compiling yep it is compiling so we're
running the right
code 4096 n
kind of suspicious the M
kind of suspicious the M
Speed doesn't seem to matter how you
compile fast for local testing
I guess we're just dropping perk in the
I guess we're just dropping perk in the
scon layer or something
something's
bizarre loads
and of curious
and of curious
uh how this
uh how this
does what's it like score of one is
does what's it like score of one is
solved
I mean the stats look
good okay so it should be able to get a
good okay so it should be able to get a
score of one
so it just save
so it just save
checkpoint 85% win
checkpoint 85% win
rate I'll let this run until it saves
rate I'll let this run until it saves
checkpoint 150 and then I'll watch
it interestingly it looks like it's
it interestingly it looks like it's
stuck it's stuck just below 90% win rate
stuck it's stuck just below 90% win rate
maybe oh no
what my connect
what my connect
for
for
eval made of
uh I think it's actually winning
uh I think it's actually winning
right did it figure how to exploit the
right did it figure how to exploit the
model or is it just that
model or is it just that
good I see a lot of similar
good I see a lot of similar
games is it always the same game it's
games is it always the same game it's
not always the same
game no it's not always but yeah this
game no it's not always but yeah this
thing is kind of good isn't
it
h i will
can you beat it probably not we'll
see I'm going to wait for it to finish
see I'm going to wait for it to finish
training the 100 Mil and I'll ship it to
training the 100 Mil and I'll ship it to
the web as well why
not then you all can see if you can beat
not then you all can see if you can beat
it we can ship uh we ship a model real
quick it's a shape
quick it's a shape
it's a shame you can't play versus it
it's a shame you can't play versus it
well I think what we're going to do is
well I think what we're going to do is
we're going to we're going to let you
we're going to we're going to let you
watch the RL agent play against the
watch the RL agent play against the
scripted opponent and then you can play
scripted opponent and then you can play
against the scripted opponent so you can
against the scripted opponent so you can
take over for the bot to see if you can
take over for the bot to see if you can
do any
do any
better we could also flip it around so
better we could also flip it around so
that you play versus the neural
that you play versus the neural
net neither of these are very
hard you'd have to strip out the
hard you'd have to strip out the
scripted we just make a flag right that
scripted we just make a flag right that
just overwrites the action or
just overwrites the action or
whatever not a big
whatever not a big
deal all right
so let me show you the process let me
so let me show you the process let me
show you how easy it is to like add a
show you how easy it is to like add a
model into pure
ciments Connect
ciments Connect
4 956
model
model
382 uh let's see connect for
382 uh let's see connect for
weights
PT going to
PT going to
be or
weights four weights. bin
okay so now we have this
okay so now we have this
model
um config
um config

ocean oh it's literally just playing
ocean oh it's literally just playing
with the default policy and it's still
with the default policy and it's still
able to win that's kind of
able to win that's kind of
weird okay
really need to sleep yeah go sleep man
really need to sleep yeah go sleep man
you wake up to a nice model online that
you wake up to a nice model online that
you can play
with thanks for this thanks for the
with thanks for this thanks for the
contributions
we can chat up weekend Monday Tuesday
we can chat up weekend Monday Tuesday
whenever see
you all right so we don't have model
you all right so we don't have model
code in here at the
moment we can just grab this from pong
uh wake up to a model lady model every
uh wake up to a model lady model every
day
please do star the repository it helps

what how's it going
Nathan M actions
this the greyhound racing
[Music]
coding a few spells cool very
nice I'm trying to think how how I want
nice I'm trying to think how how I want
to do this little bit of code right
here shift to take over for the
bot like this
default so it's 42 and then action space
default so it's 42 and then action space
is
is
seven believe it's like 42 and
7 okay and now what we actually have to
7 okay and now what we actually have to
do is
upper. num agents
upper. num agents
perfect so uh we're just going to
perfect so uh we're just going to
make uh default
net default
net default
default okay and then this is going to
default okay and then this is going to
take was it linear
it's got an
encoder actor value function I think
encoder actor value function I think
there a couple relu
maybe me
maybe me
see encoder
see encoder
is encoder
is encoder
re and then decoder
re and then decoder
oh it's just
oh it's just
decoder it's just uh linear Rel
linear and then multi-
linear and then multi-
discreete multi-
discreet say num
agents input Dam make linear make Rel
agents input Dam make linear make Rel
make linear value function multi-
make linear value function multi-
discreet actually very
discreet actually very
easy input Di
easy input Di
I don't know why it said this is hidden
I don't know why it said this is hidden
dim this is action
dim this is action
dim input
dim
dim
oh
oh
yeah hidden
yeah hidden
dim input hidden action we can even
dim input hidden action we can even
do then value function
do then value function
goes hidden dim to action dim I believe
goes hidden dim to action dim I believe
and then multi
discreete make
discreete make
multi discret is logic
multi discret is logic
sizes action
dim and then one
right we just make
right we just make
a
a
default to do a free
function
function
OBS coder yep we free
OBS coder yep we free
everything and then a
everything and then a
forward for
forward for
default linear
default linear
REO linear
linear actor value function okay so we
linear actor value function okay so we
should actually be good
already ocean
we all we do need to know
we all we do need to know
the size of this
the size of this
network so what we will
do okay 60 this is a Tiny
do okay 60 this is a Tiny
Network
Network
six tiny little net
do
interactive with puffet
Doh too few arguments to make default
Doh too few arguments to make default
uh I believe we have 128 Default hidden
dim
and
incompatible
observations expected float argument is
observations expected float argument is
of type unsigned
of type unsigned
Char uh fair
Char uh fair
enough so
enough so
we'll have to
we'll have to
do
do
float
observations we'll just copy this
in and then we'll just do observations
in and then we'll just do observations
an
address let's
address let's
see what other stuff we have to
X input is a
type unsigned
char did not save this
why is this an unsigned
sh make default
sh make default
here we pass
here we pass
[Music]
[Music]
in a linear
in a linear
layer right oh I don't know
layer right oh I don't know
why this is
why this is
dumb why did it do this
signed in actions
perfect okay now we just have argmax
perfect okay now we just have argmax
things
what happens if we just run
it we get an
it we get an
overflow on the multi discret okay
overflow on the multi discret okay
that's
that's
deserved yeah that's deserved
unsign charar
actions actions
I don't know why it does
this okay so here we
go now we have a thing that runs but
go now we have a thing that runs but
it's clearly not running the correct
it's clearly not running the correct
thing
right let's see what our network
is make
default what did we provide we said One
default what did we provide we said One
agent 42 input 128 hidden and
output appears to be
correct calic num agents times the input
correct calic num agents times the input
dim
yeah and then we do this in make
yeah and then we do this in make
linear input to Hidden this is the
encoder make Rel with the hidden
encoder make Rel with the hidden
dim and the actor here goes from hidden
dim and the actor here goes from hidden
dim to action
dim to action
dim and then value
dim and then value
function di to
function di to
one and logit
one and logit
sizes is what we do
sizes is what we do
here and this is actually already
here and this is actually already
looking
looking
fine and then what do we do we
fine and then what do we do we
do linear
do linear
on
on
OBS and and then we re and then we actor
OBS and and then we re and then we actor
and then we value
function well we can soft Max multi-
function well we can soft Max multi-
discreete no reason not to think that
discreete no reason not to think that
changes anything
though let's actually read the errors
actions is going to be an unsigned
int okay well that's a
problem let's
see expected int but got unsigned int
wait expected int got unsigned
int um I can do int star action
right
right
okay and then we have what soft Max
soft Mac takes int not unsigned in is
soft Mac takes int not unsigned in is
that
that
it so this actually should be
int expected int but it's getting
int expected int but it's getting
unsigned in
where's this
happening 465
oh I know what the problem
is I thought I know what the problem
is I thought I know what the problem
was why is this uh
I have no idea why this
I have no idea why this
is scy here because this should be
fun error
oh I see this is just a static yeah this
oh I see this is just a static yeah this
is fine we'll just do
this that's such a really like a
this that's such a really like a
ridiculous warning as well
I have to do
um
instar okay does this actually work is
instar okay does this actually work is
the question after all
the question after all
that oh yeah
and then what do we have to do
and then what do we have to do
here we
do sleep or
do sleep or
something
for e
0.5 not work
sleep
Ms oh you sleep
there we go
why is blue not winning the
game I think there's some bugs
maybe if I hold shift
maybe if I hold shift
I can take over I think
right I don't
right I don't
know it just let Blue
know it just let Blue
win I'm
win I'm
confused I don't I just win if I press
confused I don't I just win if I press
here yeah I do if I do put it in three
okay so like I
okay so like I
like
like
they this is not an allowed
state right
a PR from before
I got the network loaded in
though that's
cool for
all
all
right so at least I got uh I got that
right so at least I got uh I got that
integrated we'll have to go back to the
integrated we'll have to go back to the
rocket I think for a bit I'll leave this
rocket I think for a bit I'll leave this
up for a second I'll be right back the
restroom
e
e
e
e e
okay couple Twitter people I think more
okay couple Twitter people I think more
contributors be live for another hour or
contributors be live for another hour or
two
anyways as well drop some
anyways as well drop some
replies oops
I thought we had comments or
I thought we had comments or
something I missed something
there that's what I was that's what I

so what we're doing at the moment is I
so what we're doing at the moment is I
have this uh this rocket Lander en I
have this uh this rocket Lander en I
mean here you go Falcon 9 based on in
mean here you go Falcon 9 based on in
honor of uh the recent rocket stuff uh I
honor of uh the recent rocket stuff uh I
found this old en where is
found this old en where is
it yeah here it is there's this old
it yeah here it is there's this old
rocket en and it's really slow because
rocket en and it's really slow because
it's in Python so I'm trying to Port
it's in Python so I'm trying to Port
this stuff to C and get this working
this stuff to C and get this working
with RL and it's kind of just being a

sometimes misses on the time predictions
sometimes misses on the time predictions
so I don't know if it'll be better after
so I don't know if it'll be better after
Christmas or it'll be better like you
Christmas or it'll be better like you
know in a couple of years or whatever
know in a couple of years or whatever
we'll see
I think it is likely they'll do pretty
I think it is likely they'll do pretty
well there are a couple weird things
well there are a couple weird things
with their Tech stack um and a couple of
with their Tech stack um and a couple of
The Hires that they made are a
The Hires that they made are a
little wow I don't want to go into too
little wow I don't want to go into too
much there but
much there but
like there are a few ways that could
like there are a few ways that could
potentially go
wrong I think that they probably just
wrong I think that they probably just
win on distribution though because it's
win on distribution though because it's
literally it's in it's directly in X so
literally it's in it's directly in X so
they're probably just win on
they're probably just win on
distribution

good I know people realize they can
good I know people realize they can
cancel their chat GPT subscription and
cancel their chat GPT subscription and
just keep their
Twitter but that's less interesting
Twitter but that's less interesting
right that's like it's less interesting
right that's like it's less interesting
than making better
Tech all right let's see why is
this what is wrong with this n
here let's just do this for now
[Music]

TR saves folks 4 100 bucks
yeah I don't know I would
yeah I don't know I would
I'd frankly I'd be quite happy to stop

financially supporting open AI with all
financially supporting open AI with all
the uh the
the uh the
regulatory capture
that does irritate me quite a
bit I mean they still some really
bit I mean they still some really
awesome people there though I will say I
awesome people there though I will say I
think Alec is still there a couple other
think Alec is still there a couple other
people I
know let's see what this policy does
triggers
triggers
are
teachers I don't know about
teachers I don't know about
that se
fa uh rocket Lander mod EV
though what did I mess up Evo metal
path what do I think about what
that random saying I mean it's like a py
that random saying I mean it's like a py
saying that doesn't really hold up like
saying that doesn't really hold up like
if you think about it it doesn't really
if you think about it it doesn't really
make sense does
it this again
it shouldn't be pressing any
buttons very
buttons very
weird our triggers are our
teachers I don't
know sometimes things irritate you
know sometimes things irritate you
because you're being stubborn but
because you're being stubborn but
sometimes things irritate you because
sometimes things irritate you because
they're just stupid
GPT uh no it's not language models are
GPT uh no it's not language models are
good it's like the
good it's like the
marketing uh and the Zeitgeist around
marketing uh and the Zeitgeist around
them that bothers me more than
them that bothers me more than
anything like we had um like all the nft
anything like we had um like all the nft

moved over to AI when AI got big and
moved over to AI when AI got big and
like I would just I would like those
like I would just I would like those
people out that would be nice because
people out that would be nice because
like we're trying to do legit science
like we're trying to do legit science
and engineering here
right kind of just like
right kind of just like
bches what we're trying to
do no marketing doesn't bother me
do no marketing doesn't bother me
marketing that's not exactly honest
marketing that's not exactly honest
bothers me
Freedom's
good you're going to have to try harder
good you're going to have to try harder
than that if you're
trolling non-engineers bother you no
trolling non-engineers bother you no
dishonest dishonesty bothers me
and I'm answering
and I'm answering
questions okay I mean if you I couldn't
questions okay I mean if you I couldn't
tell it's like you don't exactly get
tell it's like you don't exactly get
tone over text but
yeah I didn't say that
some marketing is
dishonest
dishonest
okay uh I don't think it is
okay uh I don't think it is
inherently doesn't have to
be why is this
this is crazy that this doesn't
work hold on if I
work hold on if I
do no it's the train setting was fine
well bad marketing can be dishonest
well bad marketing can be dishonest
marketing can be effective and honest
marketing can be effective and honest
effective and dishonest can be
effective and dishonest can be
ineffective and honest it can be
ineffective and honest it can be

if by consumer you mean customer we have
if by consumer you mean customer we have
one we have a little landing page on

stuff did I mess this up
something happened
something happened
weird wasn't paying attention
oh I didn't mess up something weird that
oh I didn't mess up something weird that
just got
just got
corrupted okay that was
corrupted okay that was
weird whatever
there we go
the users
there we
go okay
so server
look at
look at
that look at
that look at
that now it doesn't uh load
that now it doesn't uh load
apparently let's see why
not no
bugs other ones load don't
they holy
he's load
right
right
H this doesn't load like a million
H this doesn't load like a million
assets or anything right Nathan did you
assets or anything right Nathan did you
like you didn't do like the pre-computed
like you didn't do like the pre-computed
path thing or something weird did
you B not
found U hold on
tactical
game didn't pre-compute anything
yet think I already have Flags in here
yet think I already have Flags in here
don't
I what happened to S stack size
isn't there like a Das s stack size or
isn't there like a Das s stack size or
something that I had to
something that I had to
upload I don't know what happened to
upload I don't know what happened to
this
I increase
the
the
wow web dev is so brain
wow web dev is so brain
dead reducing stack size to like
64kb that's
insane no wonder uh none other stuff
insane no wonder uh none other stuff
works let me see if I can just real
works let me see if I can just real
quick what's
quick what's
uh
uh
here msdk flag to increase uh stack
size d s stack
size I don't know if that's right
actually let's see if this works
want to get this thing
online I don't know what it's doing that
online I don't know what it's doing that
it's lagging like this and then
not no errors no
not no errors no
warnings got to love webd
is my tactical oh uh I didn't check that
is my tactical oh uh I didn't check that
but it should be
fine did something hacky
fine did something hacky
there we'll see what you mean by
that yeah this is your problem
yeah this this doesn't work for
yeah this this doesn't work for
web this is why it's freezing the page
web this is why it's freezing the page
good thing that you uh you caught that
good thing that you uh you caught that
though it would have taken me a while to
though it would have taken me a while to
figure that out to like realize to look
figure that out to like realize to look
at your file I I would assume that you
at your file I I would assume that you
just copi the
template oops
what do you use the Escape key
for getting out of spell
targeting does escap Auto
close you'll have to fix the keybind for
close you'll have to fix the keybind for
that
then I didn't actually know escape auto
closed oh
closed oh
jeez what's wrong with this thing
no
worries I fixed the
loop
what I fixed the loop
anything else
weird hold on let me build
this my whole machine is lowered
down cuz so here we
down cuz so here we
have like
have like
one yeah okay so we'll have to fix that
one yeah okay so we'll have to fix that
there's no way to get out of spell
targeting you didn't set the FPS
probably need to do that my
friend why the animations are so fast
friend why the animations are so fast
it's literally going as fast as the
it's literally going as fast as the
processor can
processor can
handle there you go isn't that
better lucky guess
yeah lucky
guess very cool for Nathan is his
en still
en still
no what do you mean still no
it cashing
no it's not caching it's still
no it's not caching it's still
broken message file not
broken message file not
found uh is there what assets does this
found uh is there what assets does this
thing need
thing need
Nathan oh I
Nathan oh I
know uh I think I
know uh I think I
know no asset wait no
assets might not work with set Target
assets might not work with set Target
FPS
okay oh yeah that could
be there's a couple weird things that
be there's a couple weird things that
you got to be careful about with uh with
you got to be careful about with uh with
web initialize
go there's a file not found thing which
go there's a file not found thing which
is kind of
weird uh I don't know and it's not
weird uh I don't know and it's not
telling
me console
you have a map.
you have a map.
h that should be fine oh no wait that's
h that should be fine oh no wait that's
not fine wait is it I think map. H is
not fine wait is it I think map. H is
fine I
fine I
think it's included from the same
directory well I don't actually see the
directory well I don't actually see the
file not found
file not found
here same as MOBA yeah
well I was asking cuz like the resources
well I was asking cuz like the resources
direct removed right we have this
direct removed right we have this
resources folder now where you can put
stuff hold
on o undefined
on o undefined
Behavior this is
something 809
that could be
that could be
bad hello
welcome okay this is this appears to be
welcome okay this is this appears to be
stable locally now oh no it's
stable locally now oh no it's
not what
not what
happened
happened
um hold on
set DT to one over
FPS let's try
this oh I hit QBE by mistake I've been
this oh I hit QBE by mistake I've been
playing too much League of Legends which
playing too much League of Legends which
is to say any League of
Legends all right what are the odds that
Legends all right what are the odds that
it works now I would say slim best
what's
304 has been mod has not been modified
okay well that doesn't make sense it
okay well that doesn't make sense it
should have been modified right
oh you know what I bet happening hold
on ah yep got it
my
bad still no
really now that looks good now um
uh it's very weird that we don't have
uh it's very weird that we don't have
any issues on this
any issues on this
um trying to think what else it would
be
be
huh works loow
game.om
map 200 2 megabytes is fine
let's try
this we have S assertions
on S assertions equals two we have
do we have Dash G on
here running
code message file not
found I don't know what the what was not
found I don't know what the what was not
found but something was not found oh
found but something was not found oh
that's bizarre now it works
randomly does it work without Dash
randomly does it work without Dash
G hold
on I'd be very surprised if it doesn't
on I'd be very surprised if it doesn't
work maybe then it was actually cast
caching
caching
well looks good
so once you figure out M scripton being
so once you figure out M scripton being
God
awful I mean this will be on the website
awful I mean this will be on the website
in just a couple
minutes it's at 5:29 I'm going to spend
minutes it's at 5:29 I'm going to spend
a little bit of time on the rocket M
a little bit of time on the rocket M
trying to figure some stuff out maybe
trying to figure some stuff out maybe
just making it look a little
just making it look a little
better around six I'll um
better around six I'll um
I'll get up and head over to the gym but
I'll get up and head over to the gym but
then I will jump on uh I'll jump on the
then I will jump on uh I'll jump on the
Discord for anybody that wants to ask
Discord for anybody that wants to ask
stuff or like you know get onboarded or
whatnot here's your game live on puffer
whatnot here's your game live on puffer
Dogg playable
now is that cool
let's see if I were actually trying to
let's see if I were actually trying to
play this game what would I
do I'd
do I'd
[Music]
[Music]
probably do this and then I don't
probably do this and then I don't
actually know is this a retreat
actually know is this a retreat
Arrow oh no it's just a linear
okay so if I were actually trying to
okay so if I were actually trying to
play this game this is what I would
play this game this is what I would
do but it's 2
do but it's 2
a.m. that is how I would do
it I think that's the best first move I
it I think that's the best first move I
don't
don't
know all right uh I'll be right back uh
know all right uh I'll be right back uh
I'm going to use the restroom it's been
I'm going to use the restroom it's been
another half hour or so on Rocket EnV at
another half hour or so on Rocket EnV at
least clean up Graphics of it explo
least clean up Graphics of it explo
explo yeah probably uh I'm going to
explo yeah probably uh I'm going to
spend like another half hour on Rocket M
spend like another half hour on Rocket M
I'm probably just going to fix the
I'm probably just going to fix the
graphics up on it and we'll figure out
graphics up on it and we'll figure out
Dynamics tomorrow or
Dynamics tomorrow or
whatever and
whatever and
um yeah and then I'll then I'll hop on
um yeah and then I'll then I'll hop on
Discord after that I'll be right back
Discord after that I'll be right back
they'll give me a
second

okay good stream
day Friendly Fire is
day Friendly Fire is
enabled I really like this m though
enabled I really like this m though
Nathan I think this is going to be
Nathan I think this is going to be
really cool um you're probably going to
really cool um you're probably going to
have to
have to
code like some sort of basic scripted Ai
code like some sort of basic scripted Ai
and then I'll have to work with you on
and then I'll have to work with you on
the action space a little bit for it um
the action space a little bit for it um
you know like maybe you can add
you know like maybe you can add
something for like hostile NPCs you know
something for like hostile NPCs you know
you can add some tofu or gobl or like
you can add some tofu or gobl or like
whatever like you know mobs um and then
whatever like you know mobs um and then
what we can do is we can just reward it
what we can do is we can just reward it
for like inflicting damage or something
for like inflicting damage or something
and I think we'll be able to get it to
and I think we'll be able to get it to
learn
something just off of that but yeah this
something just off of that but yeah this
is going to be a really cool M cuz it's
is going to be a really cool M cuz it's
an M where like the actions space is
an M where like the actions space is
kind of tricky uh and there's a lot of
kind of tricky uh and there's a lot of
potential for interesting gameplay also
potential for interesting gameplay also
this just looks
this just looks
sweet not selfplay at first we could do
sweet not selfplay at first we could do
selfplay
selfplay
um we can do selfplay if you'd like
um we can do selfplay if you'd like
to it might be harder because you can't
to it might be harder because you can't
the thing with selfplay is you can't
the thing with selfplay is you can't
have like you don't have a metric
have like you don't have a metric
anymore that's just like run a is better
anymore that's just like run a is better
than run B without doing ELO and stuff
than run B without doing ELO and stuff
we can absolutely do like V5 PVP or you
we can absolutely do like V5 PVP or you
know 8v8 PVP or whatever at some point I
know 8v8 PVP or whatever at some point I
think that it's going to be useful to
think that it's going to be useful to
have like just some really dumb scripted
have like just some really dumb scripted
things like think about like the AI in
things like think about like the AI in
doofus right like tofu or goal or
doofus right like tofu or goal or
something like that the AI is not that
something like that the AI is not that
complicated they mostly just run towards
complicated they mostly just run towards
you attack maybe they run away after
you attack maybe they run away after
stuff like
that uh I don't think so bet because if
that uh I don't think so bet because if
you use if you self buff then you can
you use if you self buff then you can
get behind an obstacle and then they
get behind an obstacle and then they
can't hit you back with the strongest
spell
H do you mind if I tweak a couple colors
H do you mind if I tweak a couple colors
Nathan if I do like the uh you know I
Nathan if I do like the uh you know I
put like the Grid in like the dark can
put like the Grid in like the dark can
and then like I convert these to be like
and then like I convert these to be like
red and can instead of red and green and
stuff I figured I'd ask permission since

is it 2 am for you now or was it 2 am
before I I can mess with stuff now if
before I I can mess with stuff now if
you want or we can set oh okay yeah no
you want or we can set oh okay yeah no
then we're not do that now uh we can
then we're not do that now uh we can
I'll set aside a block of time though
I'll set aside a block of time though
I'm very happy to just like I can hang
I'm very happy to just like I can hang
out on Discord with you in or off stream
out on Discord with you in or off stream
uh and we can just like go through and
uh and we can just like go through and
figure some stuff out on this this is
figure some stuff out on this this is
like like really this is an awesome
contribution do I know your Twitter I
contribution do I know your Twitter I
want to make sure I shout this
want to make sure I shout this
out when uh probably after I tweak a
out when uh probably after I tweak a
couple graphics and at least get you a
couple graphics and at least get you a
better
font 1 million spaces that's
funny let me fix this rocket for now
that deserves a
follow
follow
yeah this is awesome
work H you've got some good people
work H you've got some good people
following you that's funny
oh okay this is
sweet did you see the stuff on GPU drive
sweet did you see the stuff on GPU drive
or were you working on
that I probably need to fix up the
that I probably need to fix up the
puffer integration for Eugene by now
puffer integration for Eugene by now
I've been too busy coding this and
I've been too busy coding this and
working to beat Eugene to a th000
total oh yeah I saw this thing is this
total oh yeah I saw this thing is this
one that you
one that you
made oh yeah you know this did you work
made oh yeah you know this did you work
on this I don't
know yeah
okay oh you worked on knockturn I see
okay oh you worked on knockturn I see
okay
hey if you need bindings for uh this
hey if you need bindings for uh this
stuff for puffer for your actual
stuff for puffer for your actual
research I can definitely make that
research I can definitely make that
stuff
happen very cool
happen very cool
work oh okay
here very
cool well hell I was addressing you like
cool well hell I was addressing you like
you weren't a brand new to
you weren't a brand new to
RL you got already all sorts of cool
stuff that's a heck of a side project
stuff that's a heck of a side project
getting that uh that M
done yeah but you only use the doctor
done yeah but you only use the doctor
title when somebody's like being an
title when somebody's like being an
and insisting on you know being
and insisting on you know being
referred to as like
whatever that's the main use of
it respected academics doctor and
it respected academics doctor and
they'll look at you weird and tell you
they'll look at you weird and tell you
like dude I'm Joe or whatever
we're tank for
live
for e
oh get but you're oh yeah Paris yeah of
oh get but you're oh yeah Paris yeah of
course that makes sense cuz doofus
right yeah that makes total
sense
what
i l
I'm not from Paris I just I found the
I'm not from Paris I just I found the
game on mini clip when I was like 10 and
game on mini clip when I was like 10 and
got incredibly addicted to
it D what the heck was this box 2D
it D what the heck was this box 2D
include
it's really funny too because like
it's really funny too because like
literally the only games I've ever been
literally the only games I've ever been
good at are
good at are
MMOs um I don't know I did all sorts of
MMOs um I don't know I did all sorts of
crazy solo things in that and like I had
crazy solo things in that and like I had
all sorts of crazy team stuff
the darn flags for
the darn flags for
this l l box
2D
duh how long are you up to I'm going to
duh how long are you up to I'm going to
start debugging my puffer issue soon uh
start debugging my puffer issue soon uh
I'm going to just fix this for a bit and
I'm going to just fix this for a bit and
then I'm probably going to stay I'm
then I'm probably going to stay I'm
going to stay say on voice in the
going to stay say on voice in the
Discord but I'm going to go to the gym
Discord but I'm going to go to the gym
most likely and then we'll see how much
most likely and then we'll see how much
energy I have after
that hold on so okay this is already
that hold on so okay this is already
better just with the theming obviously
better just with the theming obviously
we now need to make this look like a
we now need to make this look like a
ship I actually really like like the
ship I actually really like like the
outline thing that I did earlier let me
outline thing that I did earlier let me
see how to do that
today's been a crazy good day for puffer
today's been a crazy good day for puffer
good day to be a
puffer wait so you can't why is there no
puffer wait so you can't why is there no
rectangle
rectangle
lines it also lets you do
rotation it's
annoying I mean I can just
annoying I mean I can just
like here I can just make one right
it's going to be two draw calls but I
it's going to be two draw calls but I
can do
it rectangle wreck
okay so we then we draw a rectangle
Pro kind of just want draw the lines of
Pro kind of just want draw the lines of
this don't
you I guess as long as there's nothing
you I guess as long as there's nothing
overlapping it's kind of okay
what
puffer issue is necessary to fix so that
puffer issue is necessary to fix so that
we can start Pokemon really oh okay I
we can start Pokemon really oh okay I
didn't realize that uh okay let me do
didn't realize that uh okay let me do
this real quick and I will I'll just
this real quick and I will I'll just
start on
that I thought this was like some random
that I thought this was like some random
thing that you were trying out cuz like
thing that you were trying out cuz like
I didn't think that things had changed
I didn't think that things had changed
with puffer from before right but I
with puffer from before right but I
guess they have somehow
he's setting up sweeps in Pro
he's setting up sweeps in Pro
oh
okay hold
okay hold
on let me finish this thought and then I
on let me finish this thought and then I
guess I will do that
oh this has to go up because see it's a
oh this has to go up because see it's a
little silly
I thought this was uh I thought the
I thought this was uh I thought the
error was something with resetting
M's okay there you go that's
M's okay there you go that's
like a fair bit cooler
looking we'll mess with this later
looking we'll mess with this later
what's the thing with a puffer
what's the thing with a puffer
let me
see oh very
nice we got the uh the flags for the Mac
nice we got the uh the flags for the Mac
build very good
where is this getting
where is this getting
used yo B can you can you link me like
used yo B can you can you link me like
where this is getting
where this is getting
used like when is the m getting manually
used like when is the m getting manually
reset like this
reset like this
anyways I thought that they would be
anyways I thought that they would be
getting recreated between sweeps I mean
getting recreated between sweeps I mean
between experiments on the same sweep
link me that I got one message to reply
link me that I got one message to reply
to on X I think one more potential
contributor for
wheat Branch yeah that guy I want to
wheat Branch yeah that guy I want to
know where it is that you're having to
know where it is that you're having to
do this resetting in the first
do this resetting in the first
place
place
um is he still meming me all right
um is he still meming me all right
whatever maybe shouldn't have unmuted
him refactoring plus equl
him refactoring plus equl
light uh where's your branch of this
light uh where's your branch of this
poke guess it's on the Discord hold
poke guess it's on the Discord hold
on this link thank
you this is the thing that's
erroring I'm
confused Ranch look clean puffero
all right what am I looking
at okay so you're calling this twice you
at okay so you're calling this twice you
have the the initial call at the start
have the the initial call at the start
which you want then what are you doing
which you want then what are you doing
with this
oh okay so this is the re okay I see oh
shoot so is this a
new oh because you're like making this
new oh because you're like making this
thing be your experiment
thing be your experiment
manager forcing a
manager forcing a
reset so all M's
but I'm confused because that's not
but I'm confused because that's not
actually a reset right that's like a a
actually a reset right that's like a a
simulator specific State set operation
simulator specific State set operation
isn't it like why do you have to call a
isn't it like why do you have to call a
reset to do
reset to do
this isn't it just like you send the
this isn't it just like you send the
state and then in the environments the
state and then in the environments the
individual environments are going to set
individual environments are going to set
their state
I removed the async wrappers so then
I removed the async wrappers so then
what is this
doing or I'm trying to use SQ light as a
doing or I'm trying to use SQ light as a
replacement but no you still have this Q
replacement but no you still have this Q
right this
right this
thing look at the sqlite
thing look at the sqlite
wrapper well I see that you're getting
wrapper well I see that you're getting
from the database you're getting State
from the database you're getting State
stuff right but then
in the rapper
folder two ways of creating State
folder two ways of creating State
migrations but where does this get
migrations but where does this get
called from doesn't this get this gets
called from doesn't this get this gets
called on
called on
on the individual environment level
on the individual environment level
doesn't
doesn't
it so this is called from the
subprocess so yeah then I don't
subprocess so yeah then I don't
understand why you're trying to call
understand why you're trying to call
async reset you shouldn't have to call
async reset you shouldn't have to call
the vectorized reset function you should
the vectorized reset function you should
just be able to use this thing oh
just be able to use this thing oh
because you made this a reset wrapper oh
because you made this a reset wrapper oh
um
o doesn't support put which it should
o doesn't support put which it should
it's just like I didn't bother with that
it's just like I didn't bother with that
feature because literally nobody used it
feature because literally nobody used it
so it's like why am I going to maintain
so it's like why am I going to maintain
this thing every time I screw with it if
this thing every time I screw with it if
nobody's using it
reset
reset
reset
jeez I'm trying to
jeez I'm trying to
think all right well I'll just go look
think all right well I'll just go look
at code for
at code for
you uh this might end up having to
you uh this might end up having to
be h on the puffer
box Dev
you're on 1 aren't you
you're on 1 aren't you
okay let me see if I can just eyeball
okay let me see if I can just eyeball
it and figure out what's going on
it and figure out what's going on
here let me just eyeball see if I can
here let me just eyeball see if I can
figure out what this is
so okay so what happens when we do
so we add
ah
ah
uh yo that guy um
do
do
send before you do
send before you do
this yeah no it's just for now all you
this yeah no it's just for now all you
have to do I think is you just call send
have to do I think is you just call send
before
this so you're right that that's an
oversight let me
just for
what was the other major one there was
what was the other major one there was
one other
one n cuz the other the the double thing
one n cuz the other the the double thing
is already resolved in
is already resolved in
Dev
Dev
um let me look at your code real quick
so actually this looks
fine you already called s didn't
you
you
wait am I reading this right have you
wait am I reading this right have you
called send and then you call syn
oh am I reading this right
yeah but it's weird because
like it looks to me if like if you
call wait hold
call wait hold
on cuz if you call
on cuz if you call
send then it'll
step s equals
step s equals
step what happens when you call send
step
right so what should happen
is oh
is oh
wait receive pipe. receive
well this just 197 it's just going to be
well this just 197 it's just going to be
it's just
it's just
looping because the
looping because the
semor is greater than or equal to
semor is greater than or equal to
main which means it's either in Mains or
main which means it's either in Mains or
infos
async
async
reset sends everything to
reset sends everything to
reset and then it calls send on the
reset and then it calls send on the
pipes like
pipes like
this the reset is zero
flag that doesn't make sense to
me actually should work as is um that
me actually should work as is um that
should work as is
oh
wait if
infos hang on if
infos it sets its own semaphor okay
I to write your Quick Test since this is
I to write your Quick Test since this is
important
[Music]
for
e e
hold
hold
on I got you
actually why does this not that should
actually why does this not that should
be an error right there because it
be an error right there because it
doesn't receive
H cuz it's the mixing
H cuz it's the mixing
apis yeah no that was
apis yeah no that was
correct okay so we do receive send
correct okay so we do receive send
receive send receive
receive send receive
send uh and then what do we do we
send uh and then what do we do we
do like this and we see if it breaks
do like this and we see if it breaks
does not
break well
what if I do like
what if I do like
break it still doesn't break
mhm next I'll try it async
what's this one take um num
workers batch
size there you go that's fine
num m is
num m is
30 or was it 20
30 or was it 20
40 num workers equals
40 num workers equals
2 batch size equal
20 let's see if this does
20 let's see if this does
it it's probably a a race
conditioners two bat size 20
I use my API wrong here
hold
on batch size
here didn't I do this right
40 M's two
40 M's two
workers maybe it's
workers maybe it's
this when you check for greater than
this when you check for greater than
equal to
equal to
main I don't think it's the receive
main I don't think it's the receive
pipe what I think is
happening
happening
is hold
is hold
on so what I think is happening is
this here is setting it so you're
this here is setting it so you're
calling async reset and I think that
calling async reset and I think that
while you're calling async reset the
while you're calling async reset the
worker processes are still Computing
worker processes are still Computing
stuff and they're overriding this buffer
stuff and they're overriding this buffer
I think that's the most likely
thing because this doesn't
thing because this doesn't
matter this shouldn't matter because
matter this shouldn't matter because
this is not doing a right operation this
this is not doing a right operation this
is just reading so at worst this will
is just reading so at worst this will
just make you sleep for an extra little
just make you sleep for an extra little
bit right I think that this is probably
bit right I think that this is probably
the case but I can't reproduce
the case but I can't reproduce
it I don't want to be the reason you put
it I don't want to be the reason you put
a lock well it shouldn't
need it kind of will need to have a
need it kind of will need to have a
thing on
that I can't put a lock there though is
that I can't put a lock there though is
the thing uh if you put a lock you kill
the thing uh if you put a lock you kill
the entire perf of puffer
the entire perf of puffer
so you're going to have to just there's
so you're going to have to just there's
going to have to just be like a clear
going to have to just be like a clear
function or
something literally like the lock will
something literally like the lock will
add 40 uh 40 micros seconds which is
add 40 uh 40 micros seconds which is
more it's like twice the overhead of
more it's like twice the overhead of
this entire
this entire
thing so you like triple your
overhead am I doing something stupid
overhead am I doing something stupid
here why is this not why does this not
here why is this not why does this not
run why does my own API not
work num
work num
workers bad
size there's no way to check that it's
safe that's not a thing you can do
safe that's not a thing you can do
without a
lock I think if you just call
receive we have to receive from
receive we have to receive from
everything though
okay you can't do that
okay you can't do that
um you can't do that because in between
um you can't do that because in between
the check and its setting it can still
the check and its setting it can still
happen you're describing the exact use
happen you're describing the exact use
case for a semaphor but the semaphor is
case for a semaphor but the semaphor is
too
too
slow that's why we have an array called
slow that's why we have an array called
sem
sem
that's like not really a
semor why does this stupid thing not
semor why does this stupid thing not
work am I just being dumb like
have I've been coding for too long on my
have I've been coding for too long on my
own API or is the API
own API or is the API
bad I think it is bad because they
bad I think it is bad because they
should not be able to error like
should not be able to error like
that N
that N
quars M's
quars M's
workers and workers batch size back end
oh wait this is the new Branch so
probably for
and
cereal I think I probably broke
cereal I think I probably broke
something with the new
something with the new
multiprocess I broke something here
I broke something
oh wait did
oh wait did
I no I passed it here is native
sh
e e
21 damn
it
it
01 the heck is happening here
oh hold
on star

sure more Dev daily and often cooler
sure more Dev daily and often cooler
stuff than this
stuff than this
debugging though this is this is
debugging though this is this is
important unfortunately
well that's is
weird well the debugging is also kind of
gross why is it why do we get a zero in
gross why is it why do we get a zero in
here
1 one 105 and 80 right
wait numb
workers how's this come
in
oh that's bizarre
are not this
cuz oh yeah CU you get worker index
here I mean this is a separate problem
here I mean this is a separate problem
problem though is the problem
um let me just real
quick we got get clone time down for
I'm going to try this real quick if this
I'm going to try this real quick if this
works I'm going to ship it if not I'm
works I'm going to ship it if not I'm
going to give you what I think is
going to give you what I think is
happening and then go to the gym because
happening and then go to the gym because
I'm getting hungry here and I've been
I'm getting hungry here and I've been
working on this all
working on this all
day um but I think I might have an idea
dude what the hell is wrong with this
dude what the hell is wrong with this
pip
pip
install
s did JY update with more
are you kidding
me dude it's like actually so hard to
me dude it's like actually so hard to
stay ahead of what these P people
do oh wait hold on
okay no I just improved it in 1.1 that's
okay no I just improved it in 1.1 that's
one that's
fine okay so M send receive send
fine okay so M send receive send
receive
receive
async
reset um I can't Repro this man
yeah it's not getting
yeah it's not getting
stuck um you see it's not
oh hold
on that might be
on that might be
it I think we got
it I think we got
it I think that's the Repro right there
it I think that's the Repro right there
right that's the race
condition okay I Repro
it it's non- deterministic obviously
it it's non- deterministic obviously
because it's a freaking race condition
15 can't
yes that's an obnoxious
one
for for
oops wrong one
you might actually get a rare 1 commit
you might actually get a rare 1 commit
right now it's not going to pip I'll
right now it's not going to pip I'll
tell you
tell you
that but I will actually make it to 10
that but I will actually make it to 10
for
you really that flush doesn't
work that's bizarre it should work
oh
otherwise silly me
that wasn't that
that wasn't that
bad little race
bad little race
condition just a little race
condition what was the solution I was
condition what was the solution I was
looking away um you're not allowed to to
looking away um you're not allowed to to
just continually receive until you clear
just continually receive until you clear
the buffer so I had to add a flush
the buffer so I had to add a flush
method that just waits for all the
method that just waits for all the
workers to be um to be
done should be compatible with
done should be compatible with
everything as
well manually call the flush yeah you'll
well manually call the flush yeah you'll
have to call the flush before you call
have to call the flush before you call
async reset but that's no big deal is it
I mean I can add it to Cal as well if
I mean I can add it to Cal as well if
you just want to pass
through you want
that
stable there's no way to build it into
stable there's no way to build it into
um oh I see what you mean uh
um oh I see what you mean uh
actually I might be able to do
actually I might be able to do
that hold on I might be able to do that
that hold on I might be able to do that
for you I didn't think of it
yeah no it's fine I don't I don't care
yeah no it's fine I don't I don't care
about that
sh
yeah good
call
call
O suppos not oh cuz I don't have to call
O suppos not oh cuz I don't have to call
flush anymore
I am hungry and still have two bench

anything all right there's your PR I
anything all right there's your PR I
mean there's your your fix that guy no
mean there's your your fix that guy no

been a pretty darn good day for this um
been a pretty darn good day for this um
I am going to be on the Discord voice in
I am going to be on the Discord voice in
about 2 minutes if you want to chat if
about 2 minutes if you want to chat if
you're interested in contributing if
you're interested in contributing if
you're interested in RL stuff uh yeah
you're interested in RL stuff uh yeah
I'll be around there pretty much the
