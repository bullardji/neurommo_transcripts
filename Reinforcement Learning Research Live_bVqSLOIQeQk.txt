Ouch. Not me.
Okay. So hopefully now
Okay. So hopefully now
they'll know.
Come on.
We'll see if this works for Manny.
It does.
So now I guess we go find their

benchmarks

They have benchmarks

We also should just go look at how they

basically just super oversampling it

This is 50 million time steps. And how

They get 30k SPS with this somehow.

Puffer.
Just about to set up a sweep.
There we are. That's pretty good. 86k.
There we are. That's pretty good. 86k.
90k. Yeah. This for a client. Nope. Just

together.
This is like a way way easier and
This is like a way way easier and
quicker thing than doing something with
quicker thing than doing something with
like Isaac or whatever where there's
like Isaac or whatever where there's
just tons of code to do anything. So,
just tons of code to do anything. So,
and it kind of helps of some of the
and it kind of helps of some of the
other things we do because this is also
other things we do because this is also
just a source of tasks that have um like
just a source of tasks that have um like
reasonable continuous action spaces. So,

That's been like a question that a few
That's been like a question that a few
different people have had.
But yeah, we'll see how this goes.
Oh, I did mess one thing up here,
Oh, I did mess one thing up here,
though. Good thing I caught this.
Welcome back, Finn.
Welcome back, Finn.
That was rock climbing. Climb some
That was rock climbing. Climb some
rocks.
Oh yeah,
hang on. We can chat about some hardware
hang on. We can chat about some hardware
stuff in a second. Use the restroom.
They climb rocks. I don't climb any
They climb rocks. I don't climb any
rocks
here. I'll be right back.
here. I'll be right back.
the um
right
right
let's do that. So this is the only cool
let's do that. So this is the only cool
thing I can do.
All
right.
see how our experiment should go.
We've got a few meta runs here.
They're doing
They're doing
some basic stuff it looks like.
some basic stuff it looks like.
And then
These will take longer to really do
These will take longer to really do

I don't know. Maybe I should have it be
I don't know. Maybe I should have it be
optimizing return or something instead
optimizing return or something instead
cuz it's smoother.
cuz it's smoother.
We'll have to see. It usually takes me a
We'll have to see. It usually takes me a
little bit to just like make sure I have
little bit to just like make sure I have
everything set up nicely for a new end
everything set up nicely for a new end
when things are very different.
The 510
I can chat about some of the hardware
I can chat about some of the hardware
stuff for a bit if you want guys.
Going to have to do that eventually.
Oh, look at this.
Cool.
I can hop in the Discord if y'all want.
I can hop in the Discord if y'all want.
We kind of just need to figure out what
We kind of just need to figure out what
drones we're going to like get and and
drones we're going to like get and and
fly.
Looks cool. Follows the principles of
Looks cool. Follows the principles of
puffer li.
Oh, this poor guy tried to like roll his

Yeah, that'll be a little difficult.
Oh, whoops. I meant to join the voice.
Hello. Hello.
Hello. Hello.
How's it going? Hello.
How's it going? Hello.
Hey, I figure we should like try to find
Hey, I figure we should like try to find
a drone that looks like it wouldable to
a drone that looks like it wouldable to
try to fly.
try to fly.
Yeah,
we can uh think about making our own
we can uh think about making our own
drones,
drones,
but we should probably see if we can
but we should probably see if we can
actually get it to run on existing one
actually get it to run on existing one
first, you know? Yeah, that' probably be
first, you know? Yeah, that' probably be
easier. Now, the problem is I have no
easier. Now, the problem is I have no
idea what we should get like at all.
idea what we should get like at all.
Uh we we were looking at the one that
Uh we we were looking at the one that
the like the Swiss guys used in in their
the like the Swiss guys used in in their
paper. It was just like some offtheshelf
paper. It was just like some offtheshelf
what is it? racing parts. Um, it was I
what is it? racing parts. Um, it was I
put it in general a couple of days ago.
put it in general a couple of days ago.
Let me find it. Uh, also got asteroids.
Let me find it. Uh, also got asteroids.
Cool.
Cool.
Uh, JS1. I think that's just like the

it
the I don't imagine the frame will make
the I don't imagine the frame will make
too much different as long as it's not
too much different as long as it's not
really heavy.
Say race frame. Does it say frame like
Say race frame. Does it say frame like
not the drone? I
not the drone? I
uh I think usually for like these
uh I think usually for like these
competition ones, you you buy all of
competition ones, you you buy all of
like the motors and the the blades and
like the motors and the the blades and
the actual body and camera and stuff

Huh.
Okay. Yeah, we can totally get something
Okay. Yeah, we can totally get something
like this
like this
where

I'm confused though like where you get
I'm confused though like where you get
the other stuff from.
the other stuff from.
Yeah, I I couldn't really find
Yeah, I I couldn't really find
too much else to be honest either. There
too much else to be honest either. There
was a couple of a couple of ones you
was a couple of a couple of ones you
could buy pre-built. Uh, let me see if I
could buy pre-built. Uh, let me see if I
can find it. Uh, be better if get
can find it. Uh, be better if get
something. Yeah, I mean these are all
something. Yeah, I mean these are all
like reasonly 500 or whatever.
The air 65 is another one that I've
The air 65 is another one that I've
seen. Air65 drone.

Yeah,
I can get big deal. Yeah. And then
I can get big deal. Yeah. And then
there's there's also the the to be able
there's there's also the the to be able
to run RL stuff on it, right?
to run RL stuff on it, right?
Uh yeah, that's kind of an important
Uh yeah, that's kind of an important
thing to check.

It it has there was some like
It it has there was some like

It says buy this bundle and save. But
It says buy this bundle and save. But
I'm confused because it says quadcopter

which would imply a full thing and then

Yeah, that's fine. Um,
it's tiny. 70 g.

What? Yeah, that's there's there's the
S75 as well, which is the same but um
S75 as well, which is the same but um
just bigger. If what seven g
um
um
I think I think we worked out the the
I think I think we worked out the the
like diameter of the rotors were like 2
like diameter of the rotors were like 2
in or something like that on these. How
in or something like that on these. How
is it only 17 g? Imagine the radius of
is it only 17 g? Imagine the radius of
the the whole thing. No, it's not that
the the whole thing. No, it's not that
big, I don't think, because the the the
big, I don't think, because the the the
bigger ones were were 5 in.
bigger ones were were 5 in.
And if if that's diameter uh radius,
And if if that's diameter uh radius,
it's flipping massive. Yeah. I think the
it's flipping massive. Yeah. I think the
good thing about this one is it it seems
good thing about this one is it it seems
kind of indestructible. Yeah, that's
kind of indestructible. Yeah, that's
nice cuz we're going to definitely crash
nice cuz we're going to definitely crash

pretty comprehensive, but also the
pretty comprehensive, but also the
documentation's a bit all over the
documentation's a bit all over the
place. I couldn't really just find a
place. I couldn't really just find a
straight answer anywhere.
Best micro

I'm concerned like it's going to be like
I'm concerned like it's going to be like
you literally can't run any custom code
you literally can't run any custom code
on it, right?
I'm not sure. That's
I'm not sure. That's
what I'm trying to figure out at the
what I'm trying to figure out at the
minute

cuz it's like an RC.
cuz it's like an RC.
I don't know how to hack a controller
I don't know how to hack a controller
like
like
Yeah, we don't either. Well, that's we
Yeah, we don't either. Well, that's we
we kind of tried to do that last time to
we kind of tried to do that last time to
see if we could get data any faster, but
see if we could get data any faster, but
didn't you need to get You need to be
didn't you need to get You need to be
able to directly control the uh like the

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
How did they do it in uh they did what
How did they do it in uh they did what
was it called? The FP.
was it called? The FP.
Did they have to like super hack this
Did they have to like super hack this

Maybe I'll have a I'll have a look in
Maybe I'll have a I'll have a look in
the paper in case they say what um
the paper in case they say what um
flight control they use because that

might be useful.
So each in the in the Swiss paper each

Um it's
Um it's
so literally like

Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, trying to figure out what
could do with the DJI, but uh, not

Beta flight firmware. I'm pretty sure
I've seen that before. Stuff like this
I've seen that before. Stuff like this
is super delicate looking, right? Like

We need something that we can control
We need something that we can control
that is not going to break in 5 minutes.
that is not going to break in 5 minutes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're also going to have to try and find
We're also going to have to try and find
a room which is
a room which is
big enough to fly a drone in. Can't just
big enough to fly a drone in. Can't just
fly it outside.
fly it outside.
Yeah, true.
I know you guys are CS majors, but like
I know you guys are CS majors, but like
there's this thing called the outside.
I know the grass is scary, but like we
I know the grass is scary, but like we
just cause a bit of a scene on campus by

I'm sure no one will mind.
I'm sure no one will mind.
Well, it's summer now, so in theory, no
Well, it's summer now, so in theory, no

Yeah.
Oh, so they literally lift off micro

Mhm.
Put a throttle on
a break.
Learn to solder because Yeah.
I mean, we can send we can be sending
I mean, we can send we can be sending
everyone drones, I guess, if actually
everyone drones, I guess, if actually
want to help. I got to figure out what
want to help. I got to figure out what
we going to actually get. I This looks
we going to actually get. I This looks
really good. I just don't know if we can
really good. I just don't know if we can
actually code anything on it. Well, it
actually code anything on it. Well, it
can it can run this Betaflight firmware
can it can run this Betaflight firmware
and that's what they use in what
and that's what they use in what
Betaflight firmware?
Betaflight firmware?
Uh it's this software is just called
Uh it's this software is just called

Betaflight. Um apparently that's just
like some generic open- source firmware
like some generic open- source firmware
that you can load onto lots of drones.
that you can load onto lots of drones.
Uh and then we can just do the compute
Uh and then we can just do the compute
on like a laptop or something and send
on like a laptop or something and send
it send it to it.
it send it to it.
Multirotor flight control. development
API is a list of text files. Oh, no.

Okay. Yeah.
cuz Yeah, we need to be able to set

Mhm.
This is this was my problem the other
This is this was my problem the other
day because it it sounds like it is
day because it it sounds like it is
possible but I couldn't find anything
possible but I couldn't find anything
specific in the docs which just said

like you can you can send data to the

and then it has to run. How do you
and then it has to run. How do you
actually send signal to it? It like does
actually send signal to it? It like does
the code run through an RC?
the code run through an RC?
I have no idea to be honest.
all this
all this
on your computer.
Plug the controller into the USB. Okay.
Plug the controller into the USB. Okay.
So, it'll run code and it'll use the to
So, it'll run code and it'll use the to
actually send the signal. That sounds
actually send the signal. That sounds
reasonable,
reasonable,
right? And voters. Oh,
right? And voters. Oh,
so there's a tab.
Okay, I want
commands.
Okay. So, there are commands,
Okay. So, there are commands,
right? Okay.
Like send it via serial through Python,
Like send it via serial through Python,
then you can that up. Okay.
then you can that up. Okay.
Seems reasonable.
order a couple of these. I guess I order
order a couple of these. I guess I order
a couple of these to start and uh
Well, maybe maybe start with one just to
Well, maybe maybe start with one just to
check we can get it working, but I was
check we can get it working, but I was
thinking should I send you guys one and
thinking should I send you guys one and
send myself one?
send myself one?
Okay. Yeah, sure. Yeah,
Okay. Yeah, sure. Yeah,
sounds good. I mean, these right these
Can you pump
Can you pump

Not actually.
It's a bit of a bummer that these days
It's a bit of a bummer that these days
you can't be sure that the stuff you're
you can't be sure that the stuff you're
buying off Amazon is actually real. It's
buying off Amazon is actually real. It's
just makes it irritating. Yeah. Yeah. I
just makes it irritating. Yeah. Yeah. I

right?
right?
Oh, but they you can buy a station
Oh, but they you can buy a station
where you can put a bunch of batteries
where you can put a bunch of batteries
for charging. So, they've kind of
for charging. So, they've kind of
thought of this. Basically, it's like
thought of this. Basically, it's like
there's like a six station of them. So,
there's like a six station of them. So,
basically, it only runs for a couple of
basically, it only runs for a couple of
minutes or whatever, but you just keep
minutes or whatever, but you just keep
swapping new batteries and like you just
swapping new batteries and like you just
cycle them and you just, you know, it's
cycle them and you just, you know, it's
I guess it's it's probably a pain that
I guess it's it's probably a pain that
you have to keep swapping them, but not
you have to keep swapping them, but not
that much of a pain. Yeah, we've been
that much of a pain. Yeah, we've been
through all this before.
I've just sent you a a S65 from like a

but I don't know if they're heavier.
Uh, the ones for this drone are
Uh, the ones for this drone are
um
this look like the ones from
7.11 g each.
Wait,
this the one you're looking at?
Uh,
Uh,
hold on. Let's wait for the stream

Um, the ones that they advertise for
Um, the ones that they advertise for
this drone are called the Lava 1 S's,

but it doesn't look like they're on this
but it doesn't look like they're on this

Okay.
Okay.
So, I have these and then
So, I have these and then
Oh, wait. Hold. They they do they do
Oh, wait. Hold. They they do they do
sell 300 milliamp versions as well, so
sell 300 milliamp versions as well, so
that should be fine. 2 1s are 300
that should be fine. 2 1s are 300
milliamp.
milliamp.
Yeah, that should be fine then. As long
Yeah, that should be fine then. As long
as it's the same connector. I That's
as it's the same connector. I That's
what I'm asking. You can double check. I
what I'm asking. You can double check. I
think BTO looks familiar, but I don't
think BTO looks familiar, but I don't
know. And then, will you DM me the link
know. And then, will you DM me the link
to the the page so I don't have to wait
to the the page so I don't have to wait
for the uh the delay? Thank you.
Okay.
Then is that all you need or you need a

where I actually people go like, "Oh,

a bunch of the time. It took me forever
a bunch of the time. It took me forever
figure out how to actually get them in

I I don't think I could do contacts to

a fair few folks on YouTube. So, let me
a fair few folks on YouTube. So, let me
just very quickly what we're doing here
just very quickly what we're doing here
is um the guys I'm on a call with here
is um the guys I'm on a call with here
wrote this awesome drone sim show you.
wrote this awesome drone sim show you.
It's on the website actually. It's on
It's on the website actually. It's on
puffer.ai. You can just watch it. They
puffer.ai. You can just watch it. They
have this awesome little drone sim and
have this awesome little drone sim and
this is being controlled with
this is being controlled with
reinforcement learning live in your
reinforcement learning live in your
browser. It's very lightweight. Uh, so
browser. It's very lightweight. Uh, so
we're trying to figure out if we can
we're trying to figure out if we can
throw this on a real drone. And uh, I
throw this on a real drone. And uh, I
certainly don't know anything about how
certainly don't know anything about how
to do that, but we're trying to figure
to do that, but we're trying to figure
it out. So, if you're interested in all
it out. So, if you're interested in all
this stuff and uh, I mean, these guys
this stuff and uh, I mean, these guys
literally just started like hacking on
literally just started like hacking on
some stuff and like submitted this drone
some stuff and like submitted this drone
m to uh, Puffer and like have just been
m to uh, Puffer and like have just been
working on it since. So, if you want to
working on it since. So, if you want to
get involved with all this stuff,
get involved with all this stuff,
puffer.ai. And we have all sorts of
puffer.ai. And we have all sorts of
reinforcement learning projects here.
reinforcement learning projects here.
Also, start a GitHub. Helps us out a
Also, start a GitHub. Helps us out a
lot. It's great.
lot. It's great.
All right. Um, cool. So,
All right. Um, cool. So,
yeah, if you guys can figure out like
yeah, if you guys can figure out like
what drone we should actually get. We
what drone we should actually get. We
just we need something where be able to
just we need something where be able to
plug it into a laptop. Ideally, it's
plug it into a laptop. Ideally, it's
compatible out of the box with it's like
compatible out of the box with it's like
known compatible with one of these
known compatible with one of these
libraries and doesn't have to be like
libraries and doesn't have to be like
hacked on because like as soon as you
hacked on because like as soon as you
start messing with it, you have to like
start messing with it, you have to like
deal with all the weight balancing and
deal with all the weight balancing and
stuff which is fine. But like in my
stuff which is fine. But like in my
head, if we could just like get
head, if we could just like get
something that will work to like use
something that will work to like use
initially, get it to like fly around and
initially, get it to like fly around and
kind of do some stuff and then we can
kind of do some stuff and then we can
maybe think about custom hardware after
maybe think about custom hardware after
that after we have like something that
that after we have like something that
runs. I don't think it'll be crazy
runs. I don't think it'll be crazy
difficult to get something that runs
difficult to get something that runs
because
because
basically what my thinking is is that
basically what my thinking is is that
we're just gonna like take this drone
we're just gonna like take this drone
and like make the sim be able to apply
and like make the sim be able to apply
like small random forces at every step
like small random forces at every step
for instance it's domain randomized and
for instance it's domain randomized and
then uh and then when we actually go to
then uh and then when we actually go to
fly it in the real world it'll just be
fly it in the real world it'll just be
robust and we'll probably have to like
robust and we'll probably have to like
match the dimensions and maybe even
match the dimensions and maybe even
randomize the dimens dimensions a little
randomize the dimens dimensions a little
bit during training, right? But then it
bit during training, right? But then it
seems to me at least like compared to
seems to me at least like compared to
something in robotics, this should be
something in robotics, this should be
pretty easy to sim to reel,
pretty easy to sim to reel,
right? Hopefully. Yeah, that would be
right? Hopefully. Yeah, that would be
great. We might need to simulate drag is
great. We might need to simulate drag is
the thing this thing because the uh the
the thing this thing because the uh the
drone's really lightweight. If it's
drone's really lightweight. If it's
really lightweight, drag is going to be
really lightweight, drag is going to be
quite substantial.
quite substantial.
We we do have a like our current sim at
We we do have a like our current sim at
the minute just has like a mass
the minute just has like a mass
variable. So, we can just change that
variable. So, we can just change that
and it should be fine. Yeah, I think
and it should be fine. Yeah, I think
it's just simple linear drag. We might
it's just simple linear drag. We might
have to fiddle with that. Yeah, I mean
have to fiddle with that. Yeah, I mean
it's going to just be like a little
it's going to just be like a little
matter of testing some stuff, but I I
matter of testing some stuff, but I I
think the cool thing with puffer is we
think the cool thing with puffer is we
can just randomize everything and then
can just randomize everything and then
we basically have it so it can control
we basically have it so it can control
all like the space of all possible
all like the space of all possible
drones. I think that's a way harder
drones. I think that's a way harder
problem than you think. We will find
problem than you think. We will find
out, Yanick. I have no idea. I'm
out, Yanick. I have no idea. I'm
actually I'm way more concerned about
actually I'm way more concerned about
like getting this thing correctly,
like getting this thing correctly,
receiving commands at the right rate and
receiving commands at the right rate and
all of that than I am about matching the
all of that than I am about matching the
physics. Like I know how this stuff
physics. Like I know how this stuff
works. And yes, it's a pain for stuff
works. And yes, it's a pain for stuff
like uh like arms and stuff like
like uh like arms and stuff like
humanoid arms and hands and things, but
humanoid arms and hands and things, but
a lot of that is just not being able to
a lot of that is just not being able to
do the physics with contact sim
do the physics with contact sim
correctly and stuff or like t like
correctly and stuff or like t like
tactile s like tactile differences,
tactile s like tactile differences,
whereas this is just like it's a rigid
whereas this is just like it's a rigid
body in the air. That's it.
body in the air. That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So cool.
So cool.
Yeah. And I'll have to show you guys how
Yeah. And I'll have to show you guys how
to do all the domain randomization
to do all the domain randomization
stuff. Um, it's not that difficult
stuff. Um, it's not that difficult
though. That's not that difficult.
though. That's not that difficult.
Cool.
Cool.
Basically just like adding a bunch of
Basically just like adding a bunch of
like config pars to your sim and then
like config pars to your sim and then
randomly setting them every reset.
randomly setting them every reset.
Yeah, we doesn't sound too bad. It's not
Yeah, we doesn't sound too bad. It's not
bad for this. It's not too bad. Uh the
bad for this. It's not too bad. Uh the
vision if we have to I don't think we
vision if we have to I don't think we
have to randomize anything for vision
have to randomize anything for vision
because that's just going to be like a
because that's just going to be like a
like a fixed point detector for this
like a fixed point detector for this
ring thing to start with. Yeah. Um and
ring thing to start with. Yeah. Um and
then after that even it's just probably
then after that even it's just probably
going to be like not end to end. It'll
going to be like not end to end. It'll
probably just be like some segmented
probably just be like some segmented
thing and not running. One thing that
thing and not running. One thing that
was a bit um interesting with with the
was a bit um interesting with with the
the the Swiss one is their their RL
the the Swiss one is their their RL
model can only do that like one
model can only do that like one
racetrack. It's not generalizable to
racetrack. It's not generalizable to
anything else at all. Yeah. So, we will
anything else at all. Yeah. So, we will
absolutely be able to have something
absolutely be able to have something
generalizable. In fact, I think it will
generalizable. In fact, I think it will
be easier for us to get something
be easier for us to get something
generalizable than it will be to have it
generalizable than it will be to have it
do one racetrack. Yeah. Their their
do one racetrack. Yeah. Their their
training is literally just getting
training is literally just getting
fastest times on that single. Yeah.
fastest times on that single. Yeah.
Which is kind of crazy, which it's kind
Which is kind of crazy, which it's kind
of it's going to be pretty cool. Like I
of it's going to be pretty cool. Like I
think even just that if we think about
think even just that if we think about
it, if we just do the thing that can
it, if we just do the thing that can
just do whatever track and just like
just do whatever track and just like
immediately be superhuman, that's kind
immediately be superhuman, that's kind
of already pretty nutty, right? Yeah.
of already pretty nutty, right? Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. I think we can definitely
Yeah. Yeah. I think we can definitely
even Yeah, that would be dope. I like
even Yeah, that would be dope. I like
even without going to custom hardware if
even without going to custom hardware if
we can just do that initially that would
we can just do that initially that would

it would be government or third party.
it would be government or third party.
We'll see. But yeah,
We'll see. But yeah,
well, we've got access to like a a
well, we've got access to like a a
hardware kind of lab here as well that
hardware kind of lab here as well that
we can use with lots of like 3D printers
we can use with lots of like 3D printers
and CNC machines and stuff we can use if
and CNC machines and stuff we can use if
that's fun. Okay. I actually don't even
that's fun. Okay. I actually don't even
have that stuff. Like I have uh I can
have that stuff. Like I have uh I can
solder stuff about it. I don't know if
solder stuff about it. I don't know if
can I just go back to Stanford or MIT
can I just go back to Stanford or MIT

We'll see if this works for Manny.
It does.
So now I guess we go find their

If we can get a sweep running for

Oh yeah. What was this EGL vendor
Oh yeah. What was this EGL vendor

the heck.
Where's my freaking

I didn't do that before.
So, this runs.
We have to do a little bit of tweaking.

Not very much, just a little bit. So,
Not very much, just a little bit. So,
numbum M's can't be swept,

but update epochs needed.
We also need to do um

All right.
Okay, it runs

not complain about.
I have to not randomize this. I do need

I mean,
Let's try this.
Let's try this.
Hey Brad, welcome. We are uh trying to

Just about to set up a sweep.
There we are. That's pretty good. 86k.

This is like a way way easier and

just tons of code to do anything. So,

and it kind of helps of some of the

That's been like a question that a few
That's been like a question that a few
different people have had.
But yeah, we'll see how this goes.
Oh, I did mess one thing up here,
Oh, I did mess one thing up here,
though. Good thing I caught this.
Welcome back, Finn.
Welcome back, Finn.
That was rock climbing. Climb some

Oh yeah,
hang on. We can chat about some hardware

the um
right
right
let's do that. So this is the only cool
let's do that. So this is the only cool
thing I can do.
All
right.
see how our experiment should go.
We've got a few meta runs here.
They're doing
They're doing
some basic stuff it looks like.

And then
These will take longer to really do

We'll have to see. It usually takes me a
We'll have to see. It usually takes me a
little bit to just like make sure I have

everything set up nicely for a new end
everything set up nicely for a new end
when things are very different.
The 510
I can chat about some of the hardware
I can chat about some of the hardware
stuff for a bit if you want guys.
Going to have to do that eventually.
Oh, look at this.
Cool.
I can hop in the Discord if y'all want.
I can hop in the Discord if y'all want.
We kind of just need to figure out what

Yeah, that'll be a little difficult.
Oh, whoops. I meant to join the voice.
Hello. Hello.
Hello. Hello.
How's it going? Hello.

Hey, I figure we should like try to find

try to fly.
try to fly.
Yeah,
we can uh think about making our own
we can uh think about making our own
drones,
drones,
but we should probably see if we can
but we should probably see if we can
actually get it to run on existing one
actually get it to run on existing one
first, you know? Yeah, that' probably be
first, you know? Yeah, that' probably be
easier. Now, the problem is I have no
easier. Now, the problem is I have no
idea what we should get like at all.
idea what we should get like at all.
Uh we we were looking at the one that
Uh we we were looking at the one that
the like the Swiss guys used in in their
the like the Swiss guys used in in their
paper. It was just like some offtheshelf

what is it? racing parts. Um, it was I
what is it? racing parts. Um, it was I
put it in general a couple of days ago.
put it in general a couple of days ago.
Let me find it. Uh, also got asteroids.

too much different as long as it's not
too much different as long as it's not
really heavy.
Say race frame. Does it say frame like

not the drone? I
not the drone? I
uh I think usually for like these
uh I think usually for like these
competition ones, you you buy all of

the actual body and camera and stuff

Huh.
Okay. Yeah, we can totally get something
Okay. Yeah, we can totally get something
like this
like this
where

I'm confused though like where you get
I'm confused though like where you get
the other stuff from.
the other stuff from.
Yeah, I I couldn't really find
Yeah, I I couldn't really find
too much else to be honest either. There
too much else to be honest either. There
was a couple of a couple of ones you
was a couple of a couple of ones you
could buy pre-built. Uh, let me see if I
could buy pre-built. Uh, let me see if I
can find it. Uh, be better if get
can find it. Uh, be better if get
something. Yeah, I mean these are all
something. Yeah, I mean these are all
like reasonly 500 or whatever.
The air 65 is another one that I've
The air 65 is another one that I've

Yeah,
I can get big deal. Yeah. And then
I can get big deal. Yeah. And then
there's there's also the the to be able
there's there's also the the to be able
to run RL stuff on it, right?

Uh yeah, that's kind of an important
Uh yeah, that's kind of an important
thing to check.

It it has there was some like

just bigger. If what seven g
um
um
I think I think we worked out the the
I think I think we worked out the the
like diameter of the rotors were like 2
like diameter of the rotors were like 2
in or something like that on these. How
in or something like that on these. How
is it only 17 g? Imagine the radius of

the the whole thing. No, it's not that
the the whole thing. No, it's not that
big, I don't think, because the the the
big, I don't think, because the the the
bigger ones were were 5 in.
bigger ones were were 5 in.
And if if that's diameter uh radius,
And if if that's diameter uh radius,
it's flipping massive. Yeah. I think the
it's flipping massive. Yeah. I think the
good thing about this one is it it seems
good thing about this one is it it seems
kind of indestructible. Yeah, that's
kind of indestructible. Yeah, that's
nice cuz we're going to definitely crash

pretty comprehensive, but also the
pretty comprehensive, but also the
documentation's a bit all over the
documentation's a bit all over the
place. I couldn't really just find a
place. I couldn't really just find a
straight answer anywhere.
Best micro

I'm concerned like it's going to be like
I'm concerned like it's going to be like
you literally can't run any custom code
you literally can't run any custom code
on it, right?
I'm not sure. That's
I'm not sure. That's
what I'm trying to figure out at the
what I'm trying to figure out at the
minute
minute
cuz it's like an RC.
cuz it's like an RC.
I don't know how to hack a controller
I don't know how to hack a controller
like
like
Yeah, we don't either. Well, that's we
Yeah, we don't either. Well, that's we
we kind of tried to do that last time to
we kind of tried to do that last time to
see if we could get data any faster, but
see if we could get data any faster, but
didn't you need to get You need to be
didn't you need to get You need to be
able to directly control the uh like the
able to directly control the uh like the

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
How did they do it in uh they did what
How did they do it in uh they did what
was it called? The FP.

Did they have to like super hack this
Did they have to like super hack this

Maybe I'll have a I'll have a look in
Maybe I'll have a I'll have a look in
the paper in case they say what um
the paper in case they say what um
flight control they use because that

might be useful.
So each in the in the Swiss paper each

Um, trying to figure out what

Well, this this F65 drone supports this

I've seen that before. Stuff like this
I've seen that before. Stuff like this
is super delicate looking, right? Like

these likeosed ones. These literally

will just like you're going to break
will just like you're going to break
these in five minutes. Yeah.
these in five minutes. Yeah.
We need something that we can control
We need something that we can control
that is not going to break in 5 minutes.
that is not going to break in 5 minutes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We're also going to have to try and find
We're also going to have to try and find
a room which is
a room which is
big enough to fly a drone in. Can't just
big enough to fly a drone in. Can't just
fly it outside.
fly it outside.
Yeah, true.
I know you guys are CS majors, but like
I know you guys are CS majors, but like
there's this thing called the outside.
I know the grass is scary, but like we
I know the grass is scary, but like we
just cause a bit of a scene on campus by
just cause a bit of a scene on campus by
like flying drones, but

I'm sure no one will mind.
I'm sure no one will mind.
Well, it's summer now, so in theory, no
Well, it's summer now, so in theory, no
one will be around.
one will be around.
Yeah.
Oh, so they literally lift off micro
Oh, so they literally lift off micro

they have an app where there's like a

Mhm.
Put a throttle on
a break.
Learn to solder because Yeah.
I mean, we can send we can be sending
I mean, we can send we can be sending
everyone drones, I guess, if actually
everyone drones, I guess, if actually
want to help. I got to figure out what
want to help. I got to figure out what
we going to actually get. I This looks
we going to actually get. I This looks
really good. I just don't know if we can
really good. I just don't know if we can
actually code anything on it. Well, it
actually code anything on it. Well, it
can it can run this Betaflight firmware
can it can run this Betaflight firmware
and that's what they use in what
and that's what they use in what
Betaflight firmware?
Betaflight firmware?
Uh it's this software is just called
Uh it's this software is just called
Betaflight. Um apparently that's just
Betaflight. Um apparently that's just
like some generic open- source firmware
like some generic open- source firmware
that you can load onto lots of drones.
that you can load onto lots of drones.
Uh and then we can just do the compute
Uh and then we can just do the compute
on like a laptop or something and send
on like a laptop or something and send
it send it to it.
it send it to it.
Multirotor flight control. development
API is a list of text files. Oh, no.

Okay. Yeah.
cuz Yeah, we need to be able to set
cuz Yeah, we need to be able to set
camera obviously.
camera obviously.
Mhm.
This is this was my problem the other
This is this was my problem the other
day because it it sounds like it is
day because it it sounds like it is
possible but I couldn't find anything
possible but I couldn't find anything
specific in the docs which just said
specific in the docs which just said
like you can you can send data to the
like you can you can send data to the
rotors and control them like
rotors and control them like
individually
individually
and then it has to run. How do you
and then it has to run. How do you
actually send signal to it? It like does
actually send signal to it? It like does
the code run through an RC?
the code run through an RC?
I have no idea to be honest.
all this
all this
on your computer.
Plug the controller into the USB. Okay.
Plug the controller into the USB. Okay.
So, it'll run code and it'll use the to
So, it'll run code and it'll use the to
actually send the signal. That sounds
actually send the signal. That sounds
reasonable,
reasonable,
right? And voters. Oh,
right? And voters. Oh,
so there's a tab.
Okay, I want
commands.
Okay. So, there are commands,
Okay. So, there are commands,
right? Okay.
Like send it via serial through Python,
Like send it via serial through Python,
then you can that up. Okay.
then you can that up. Okay.
Seems reasonable.
order a couple of these. I guess I order
order a couple of these. I guess I order
a couple of these to start and uh
Well, maybe maybe start with one just to
Well, maybe maybe start with one just to
check we can get it working, but I was
check we can get it working, but I was
thinking should I send you guys one and
thinking should I send you guys one and
send myself one?
send myself one?
Okay. Yeah, sure. Yeah,
Okay. Yeah, sure. Yeah,
sounds good. I mean, these right these
Can you pump
Can you pump
eggs?
Not actually.
It's a bit of a bummer that these days
It's a bit of a bummer that these days
you can't be sure that the stuff you're
you can't be sure that the stuff you're
buying off Amazon is actually real. It's
buying off Amazon is actually real. It's
just makes it irritating. Yeah. Yeah. I
just makes it irritating. Yeah. Yeah. I
mean, if you see it's from the
mean, if you see it's from the
actual main, they have a page. Beta FP
actual main, they have a page. Beta FP
has a page. Mhm.
has a page. Mhm.
So, it's the
So, it's the
Yeah, it's funny. So, there's Beta FPV.
Yeah, it's funny. So, there's Beta FPV.
Okay. And then the second option is from
Okay. And then the second option is from

Right.
That was legit.
That was legit.
Can you guys take care if I just send

there's like a six station of them. So,
there's like a six station of them. So,
basically, it only runs for a couple of
basically, it only runs for a couple of
minutes or whatever, but you just keep
minutes or whatever, but you just keep
swapping new batteries and like you just
swapping new batteries and like you just
cycle them and you just, you know, it's
cycle them and you just, you know, it's
I guess it's it's probably a pain that
I guess it's it's probably a pain that
you have to keep swapping them, but not
you have to keep swapping them, but not
that much of a pain. Yeah, we've been
that much of a pain. Yeah, we've been
through all this before.
I've just sent you a a S65 from like a

anything, I think. Cool.
anything, I think. Cool.
But then and then can I send you
But then and then can I send you
accessories? I guess. Do they have the
accessories? I guess. Do they have the
accessories on here that you need?
Yeah, there there is like a battery
Yeah, there there is like a battery

And then
And then
it says on the the beta FPV website. Uh

That's what we need, I guess. So 1s
That's what we need, I guess. So 1s
there all these different batteries.
there all these different batteries.
Yeah. So, there's
Yeah, I assume if it's if it's the same

but I don't know if they're heavier.
Uh, the ones for this drone are
Uh, the ones for this drone are
um
this look like the ones from
7.11 g each.
Wait,
this the one you're looking at?
Uh,
Uh,
hold on. Let's wait for the stream

but it doesn't look like they're on this
but it doesn't look like they're on this

Okay.
Okay.
So, I have these and then
So, I have these and then
Oh, wait. Hold. They they do they do
Oh, wait. Hold. They they do they do
sell 300 milliamp versions as well, so
sell 300 milliamp versions as well, so
that should be fine. 2 1s are 300
that should be fine. 2 1s are 300
milliamp.
milliamp.
Yeah, that should be fine then. As long
Yeah, that should be fine then. As long
as it's the same connector. I That's
as it's the same connector. I That's
what I'm asking. You can double check. I
what I'm asking. You can double check. I
think BTO looks familiar, but I don't
think BTO looks familiar, but I don't
know. And then, will you DM me the link
know. And then, will you DM me the link
to the the page so I don't have to wait
to the the page so I don't have to wait
for the uh the delay? Thank you.
Okay.
Then is that all you need or you need a

where I actually people go like, "Oh,

a bunch of the time. It took me forever
a bunch of the time. It took me forever
figure out how to actually get them in

I I don't think I could do contacts to

a fair few folks on YouTube. So, let me
just very quickly what we're doing here
just very quickly what we're doing here
is um the guys I'm on a call with here
is um the guys I'm on a call with here
wrote this awesome drone sim show you.
wrote this awesome drone sim show you.
It's on the website actually. It's on
It's on the website actually. It's on
puffer.ai. You can just watch it. They
puffer.ai. You can just watch it. They
have this awesome little drone sim and
have this awesome little drone sim and
this is being controlled with
this is being controlled with
reinforcement learning live in your
reinforcement learning live in your
browser. It's very lightweight. Uh, so
browser. It's very lightweight. Uh, so
we're trying to figure out if we can
we're trying to figure out if we can
throw this on a real drone. And uh, I
throw this on a real drone. And uh, I
certainly don't know anything about how
certainly don't know anything about how
to do that, but we're trying to figure
to do that, but we're trying to figure
it out. So, if you're interested in all
it out. So, if you're interested in all
this stuff and uh, I mean, these guys
this stuff and uh, I mean, these guys
literally just started like hacking on
literally just started like hacking on
some stuff and like submitted this drone
some stuff and like submitted this drone
m to uh, Puffer and like have just been
m to uh, Puffer and like have just been
working on it since. So, if you want to
working on it since. So, if you want to
get involved with all this stuff,
get involved with all this stuff,
puffer.ai. And we have all sorts of
puffer.ai. And we have all sorts of
reinforcement learning projects here.
reinforcement learning projects here.
Also, start a GitHub. Helps us out a
Also, start a GitHub. Helps us out a
lot. It's great.
lot. It's great.
All right. Um, cool. So,
All right. Um, cool. So,
yeah, if you guys can figure out like
yeah, if you guys can figure out like
what drone we should actually get. We
what drone we should actually get. We
just we need something where be able to
just we need something where be able to
plug it into a laptop. Ideally, it's
plug it into a laptop. Ideally, it's
compatible out of the box with it's like
compatible out of the box with it's like
known compatible with one of these
known compatible with one of these
libraries and doesn't have to be like
libraries and doesn't have to be like
hacked on because like as soon as you
hacked on because like as soon as you
start messing with it, you have to like
start messing with it, you have to like
deal with all the weight balancing and
deal with all the weight balancing and
stuff which is fine. But like in my
stuff which is fine. But like in my
head, if we could just like get
head, if we could just like get
something that will work to like use
something that will work to like use
initially, get it to like fly around and
initially, get it to like fly around and
kind of do some stuff and then we can
kind of do some stuff and then we can
maybe think about custom hardware after
maybe think about custom hardware after
that after we have like something that
that after we have like something that
runs. I don't think it'll be crazy
runs. I don't think it'll be crazy
difficult to get something that runs
difficult to get something that runs
because
because
basically what my thinking is is that
basically what my thinking is is that
we're just gonna like take this drone
we're just gonna like take this drone
and like make the sim be able to apply
and like make the sim be able to apply
like small random forces at every step
like small random forces at every step
for instance it's domain randomized and
for instance it's domain randomized and
then uh and then when we actually go to
then uh and then when we actually go to
fly it in the real world it'll just be
fly it in the real world it'll just be
robust and we'll probably have to like
robust and we'll probably have to like
match the dimensions and maybe even
match the dimensions and maybe even
randomize the dimens dimensions a little
randomize the dimens dimensions a little
bit during training, right? But then it
bit during training, right? But then it
seems to me at least like compared to
seems to me at least like compared to
something in robotics, this should be
something in robotics, this should be
pretty easy to sim to reel,
pretty easy to sim to reel,
right? Hopefully. Yeah, that would be
right? Hopefully. Yeah, that would be
great. We might need to simulate drag is
great. We might need to simulate drag is
the thing this thing because the uh the
the thing this thing because the uh the
drone's really lightweight. If it's
drone's really lightweight. If it's
really lightweight, drag is going to be
really lightweight, drag is going to be
quite substantial.
quite substantial.
We we do have a like our current sim at
We we do have a like our current sim at
the minute just has like a mass
the minute just has like a mass
variable. So, we can just change that
variable. So, we can just change that
and it should be fine. Yeah, I think
and it should be fine. Yeah, I think
it's just simple linear drag. We might
it's just simple linear drag. We might
have to fiddle with that. Yeah, I mean
have to fiddle with that. Yeah, I mean
it's going to just be like a little
it's going to just be like a little
matter of testing some stuff, but I I
matter of testing some stuff, but I I
think the cool thing with puffer is we
think the cool thing with puffer is we
can just randomize everything and then
can just randomize everything and then
we basically have it so it can control
we basically have it so it can control
all like the space of all possible
all like the space of all possible
drones. I think that's a way harder
drones. I think that's a way harder
problem than you think. We will find
problem than you think. We will find
out, Yanick. I have no idea. I'm
out, Yanick. I have no idea. I'm
actually I'm way more concerned about
actually I'm way more concerned about
like getting this thing correctly,
like getting this thing correctly,
receiving commands at the right rate and
receiving commands at the right rate and
all of that than I am about matching the
all of that than I am about matching the
physics. Like I know how this stuff
physics. Like I know how this stuff
works. And yes, it's a pain for stuff
works. And yes, it's a pain for stuff
like uh like arms and stuff like
like uh like arms and stuff like
humanoid arms and hands and things, but
humanoid arms and hands and things, but
a lot of that is just not being able to
a lot of that is just not being able to
do the physics with contact sim
do the physics with contact sim
correctly and stuff or like t like
correctly and stuff or like t like
tactile s like tactile differences,
tactile s like tactile differences,
whereas this is just like it's a rigid
whereas this is just like it's a rigid
body in the air. That's it.
body in the air. That's it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So cool.
So cool.
Yeah. And I'll have to show you guys how
Yeah. And I'll have to show you guys how
to do all the domain randomization
to do all the domain randomization
stuff. Um, it's not that difficult
stuff. Um, it's not that difficult
though. That's not that difficult.
though. That's not that difficult.
Cool.
Cool.
Basically just like adding a bunch of
Basically just like adding a bunch of
like config pars to your sim and then
like config pars to your sim and then
randomly setting them every reset.
randomly setting them every reset.
Yeah, we doesn't sound too bad. It's not
Yeah, we doesn't sound too bad. It's not
bad for this. It's not too bad. Uh the
bad for this. It's not too bad. Uh the
vision if we have to I don't think we
vision if we have to I don't think we
have to randomize anything for vision
have to randomize anything for vision
because that's just going to be like a
because that's just going to be like a
like a fixed point detector for this
like a fixed point detector for this
ring thing to start with. Yeah. Um and
ring thing to start with. Yeah. Um and
then after that even it's just probably
then after that even it's just probably
going to be like not end to end. It'll
going to be like not end to end. It'll
probably just be like some segmented
probably just be like some segmented
thing and not running. One thing that
thing and not running. One thing that
was a bit um interesting with with the
was a bit um interesting with with the
the the Swiss one is their their RL
the the Swiss one is their their RL
model can only do that like one
model can only do that like one
racetrack. It's not generalizable to
racetrack. It's not generalizable to
anything else at all. Yeah. So, we will
anything else at all. Yeah. So, we will
absolutely be able to have something
absolutely be able to have something
generalizable. In fact, I think it will
generalizable. In fact, I think it will
be easier for us to get something
be easier for us to get something
generalizable than it will be to have it
generalizable than it will be to have it
do one racetrack. Yeah. Their their
do one racetrack. Yeah. Their their
training is literally just getting
training is literally just getting
fastest times on that single. Yeah.
fastest times on that single. Yeah.
Which is kind of crazy, which it's kind
Which is kind of crazy, which it's kind
of it's going to be pretty cool. Like I
of it's going to be pretty cool. Like I
think even just that if we think about
think even just that if we think about
it, if we just do the thing that can
it, if we just do the thing that can
just do whatever track and just like
just do whatever track and just like
immediately be superhuman, that's kind
immediately be superhuman, that's kind
of already pretty nutty, right? Yeah.
