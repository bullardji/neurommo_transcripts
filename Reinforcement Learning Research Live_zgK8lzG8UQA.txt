Okay.
Should be live here.
Should be live here.
Hi.
Oops. Let's not show that.
Let me fix this real quick.
Why? Why can I not fix the stream?
There we go.
Okay,
here's the plan for today.
here's the plan for today.
First, we're going to post the article.
Welcome, RM.
I promised I would post uh the
I promised I would post uh the
educational article at 10K followers.
So, we are going to do that right now.
So, we are going to do that right now.
The only thing I have to figure out,
The only thing I have to figure out,
I've got two articles here. This one's
I've got two articles here. This one's
4K words. This one's 2K words.
So, the only thing I got to figure out
So, the only thing I got to figure out
is uh what images we're going to put on
is uh what images we're going to put on
here.
here.
I figured I would just do this live
I figured I would just do this live
while a stream warms up and we will go
while a stream warms up and we will go
from there. And then after that, we're
from there. And then after that, we're
going to work on drone things most
going to work on drone things most
likely.
I don't know. Let's just make something
I don't know. Let's just make something
real quick.
real quick.
uh
uh
guide
guide
image
52 ratio.
52 ratio.
So like
let's do I don't know what's like what's
let's do I don't know what's like what's
a good 52 ratio? Let's do like x300. So
a good 52 ratio? Let's do like x300. So
1,500
1,500
by like 600. Is that right?
I was just going to put like a basic
I was just going to put like a basic
like summary thing in the image maybe.
like summary thing in the image maybe.
Oh, let me also go grab the uh the
Oh, let me also go grab the uh the
puffer fish. So, of course, we're gonna
puffer fish. So, of course, we're gonna
have him in there.
We'll post the article. Shouldn't take
We'll post the article. Shouldn't take
me too long to do that. And then we will
me too long to do that. And then we will
do drone stuff for the rest of today.
Upper fish. PNG.
Upper fish. PNG.
Oops.
There we go. There's a puffer.
How's RL coming along?
How's RL coming along?
We have all sorts of fun stuff, man.
We have all sorts of fun stuff, man.
We've got uh the drone end is working
We've got uh the drone end is working
pretty well at this point.
pretty well at this point.
I think that the main thing I'm going to
I think that the main thing I'm going to
be working on today is like cleaning it
be working on today is like cleaning it
up and figuring out if we can get like
up and figuring out if we can get like
one policy, basically one policy that
one policy, basically one policy that
can do all the drone stuff we would ever
can do all the drone stuff we would ever
want. We just have like one really
want. We just have like one really
really good drone benchmark.
We shall see though.
That's the spirit. Yeah. I uh the one
That's the spirit. Yeah. I uh the one
thing is I always I hate having to do
thing is I always I hate having to do
thumbnails and like advertising type
thumbnails and like advertising type
work because it's just it's really
work because it's just it's really
obnoxious. So here if you have any ideas
obnoxious. So here if you have any ideas
actually we'll we'll crowdsource this.
actually we'll we'll crowdsource this.
Um,
Um,
so I have this article, my advice for
so I have this article, my advice for
programming in ML. I've got this one,
programming in ML. I've got this one,
the ultra opinionated guide to
the ultra opinionated guide to
reinforcement learning.
reinforcement learning.
And uh, we need to have some thumbnails
And uh, we need to have some thumbnails
for this. So, usually I do like AI gen.
for this. So, usually I do like AI gen.
I was thinking I would just actually for
I was thinking I would just actually for
these since these are more educational
these since these are more educational
materials, I would just like put some
materials, I would just like put some
basic summary stuff in it. Give it a
basic summary stuff in it. Give it a
follow.
follow.
Drop your X.
Drop your X.
We just hit 10K on it today actually,
We just hit 10K on it today actually,
which is really nice.
which is really nice.
I will put this in the chat.
There you go.
Why is Why are my notifications blowing
Why is Why are my notifications blowing
up?
That's fine.
Let me get into Twitter stuff here.
Let me get into Twitter stuff here.
I'm traveling and deving. Surely there's
I'm traveling and deving. Surely there's
an audience for me out there somewhere.
Oh, yeah. It's uh
Oh, yeah. It's uh
Twitter's been really good for pretty
Twitter's been really good for pretty
much everything.
much everything.
It's gotten us a lot of um I mean
It's gotten us a lot of um I mean
business side has done well from there
business side has done well from there
as well. Okay, let's see here. So, what
as well. Okay, let's see here. So, what
what do I write like?
I just think I go grab like the main
I just think I go grab like the main
topic points from the articles, right?
topic points from the articles, right?
Why are you making the guide image in
Why are you making the guide image in
Docs? It's not Docs. This is This is

Google Drawings.
Is Figma like actually good for like a
Is Figma like actually good for like a
basic editor that stays the hell out of
basic editor that stays the hell out of
your way?
Like I'll open or something if I
Like I'll open or something if I
need to do heavier stuff. Mostly I used
need to do heavier stuff. Mostly I used
Photoshop before but it's not the web
Photoshop before but it's not the web
version of Photoshop sucks and I'm on
version of Photoshop sucks and I'm on
Linux So,
Can I just copy all the the bolded like
Can I just copy all the the bolded like
titles?
That doesn't seem great.
I guess I could
I guess I could
Let's see if I just like start copying
Let's see if I just like start copying
these in if I like what this this does
these in if I like what this this does
or that I like the way that this looks.
Photoshop has
doing since Yeah, I've done I've done

How's it been like to build a community
How's it been like to build a community
in such a non

okay a non-traditional way

there doubt you along from are there

not all that non-traditional

if you think about it

I've kind of just basically what I've
I've kind of just basically what I've
done is I've taken very traditional very

very traditional credentials and then
very traditional credentials and then
I've done something non-traditional with

right?
Cuz like I basically I've done like kind
Cuz like I basically I've done like kind
of semiindy dev stuff where I built like

You're trying to make a thumbnail, you
You're trying to make a thumbnail, you
should try out Mid Journey,
should try out Mid Journey,
negative space, and overlap summaries.
Yeah, I've So, I've done that. If you
Yeah, I've So, I've done that. If you
click any of my articles on X, I've kind
click any of my articles on X, I've kind
of done a bunch of AI gen. I wanted to
of done a bunch of AI gen. I wanted to
have something different for this
I'm just going to try something, you
I'm just going to try something, you
know?
I don't really want AI gen crap. It's
I don't really want AI gen crap. It's
kind of funny. Like I really like um
kind of funny. Like I really like um
like all the AI stuff is cool, but I
like all the AI stuff is cool, but I
really don't like generative AI in most
really don't like generative AI in most
of what I do at all.
In some sense, it's like the least
In some sense, it's like the least
interesting part of AI to me.
at least as it is right now.
I think when you combine it with way
I think when you combine it with way
heavier RL than people are doing now,
heavier RL than people are doing now,
generate a AI is going to be really
generate a AI is going to be really
good. But like I'm not doing that
good. But like I'm not doing that
because it's just it's so much slower
because it's just it's so much slower
and more expensive and crap to to do
and more expensive and crap to to do
your RL research on Gen AI instead of
your RL research on Gen AI instead of
just doing it in the way I'm doing it.
just doing it in the way I'm doing it.
Hi Joseph building. Okay, I read that

The 5090 is sometimes a very small boost
The 5090 is sometimes a very small boost
above a 4090. Sometimes it's a very
above a 4090. Sometimes it's a very
large boost. It kind of depends on the
large boost. It kind of depends on the
problem. And then you you're not going

to notice the multi-core performance at

you're going to be hard bottlenecked on

They're
cherrypicked conditions.
Huh. I haven't looked at that honestly.
Like the thing is it just it depends how
Like the thing is it just it depends how
good your Sims are, right?

So, here's the thing.

nobody knows how to program anymore.
Let's bold this.

Or unbold this maybe.
Let's put like a

Congrats on 10K. Hello, Finn. Welcome.
Congrats on 10K. Hello, Finn. Welcome.
Uh, did you see the thing I sent you
Uh, did you see the thing I sent you
guys? We can fly whatever drones. Now, I
guys? We can fly whatever drones. Now, I
do need to ask you guys a bunch of
do need to ask you guys a bunch of
physics, though. If you're around,
can I actually just link this to you
can I actually just link this to you
real quick?
real quick?
Let me let me link you. what I did
Let me let me link you. what I did
because I need uh I need your guys input
because I need uh I need your guys input
on this
on this
because I'm going to be working on this
because I'm going to be working on this
today for you as well.
All right, read this this function here.
Can you guys read this function and tell
Can you guys read this function and tell
me if I did garbage with the modeling?
me if I did garbage with the modeling?
So the goal here is that this should be
So the goal here is that this should be
able to represent basically any type of
able to represent basically any type of
reasonable drone you can put together
possibly with reducing pollution
possibly with reducing pollution
emissions in factories.
emissions in factories.
They straight up build a sim and then
They straight up build a sim and then
move things in the sim. Yeah, if there's
move things in the sim. Yeah, if there's
an agent in the loop in a sim then yeah
an agent in the loop in a sim then yeah
uh that's a and maybe we can fit
uh that's a and maybe we can fit
something. I'd happily take a meeting on
something. I'd happily take a meeting on
that.
Oh yeah, people are really uh looking
Oh yeah, people are really uh looking
for this. I just posted this at
for this. I just posted this at
breakfast.
We'll have a look. Thank you.
We'll have a look. Thank you.
So, if we can represent pretty much any
So, if we can represent pretty much any
sort of reasonable drone fin,
then uh we should have a very easy time
then uh we should have a very easy time
getting this working on whatever
getting this working on whatever
specific hardware.
And yeah, don't forget the meeting later
And yeah, don't forget the meeting later
as well, Spencer, if you're still here.
I use JavaScript to put temporary
I use JavaScript to put temporary
AI memories in browser local storage.
AI memories in browser local storage.
I'm see JavaScript, right?
I'm see JavaScript, right?
I don't know what that means.
Oops.
What kind of hot topics would you direct

Are you in the US or are you in uh
Are you in the US or are you in uh
Europe? In the US, you don't do a

Like in the US, you go direct from
Like in the US, you go direct from
undergrad to PhD. You don't do a
undergrad to PhD. You don't do a
master's and then depending on your
master's and then depending on your
program, they kind of just give you a
program, they kind of just give you a
master's along the way for the hell of
master's along the way for the hell of
it.
And it's
And it's
you're not going to get any sort of
you're not going to get any sort of
optimistic take from me at all about

We had we had hundreds to thousands of

the thing is that RL has gotten mostly

bottlenecked on
bottlenecked on
it's gotten mostly bottlenecked on
it's gotten mostly bottlenecked on
engineering and like academia is just

allergic to engineering. So even when
allergic to engineering. So even when
that's the way to solve the science
that's the way to solve the science
problem they care about, they just won't
problem they care about, they just won't
do it.
So uh I don't I don't really have any
So uh I don't I don't really have any
good insights about the scientific
good insights about the scientific
process because it's kind of just
Like I can tell you what are topics that
Like I can tell you what are topics that
are impactful in research. I can tell
are impactful in research. I can tell
you topics that are like going to
you topics that are like going to
revolutionize the field and change the
revolutionize the field and change the
world. But those are not the same things

that get science excited like
that get science excited like
at all. Usually it's when you come up
at all. Usually it's when you come up
with some like clever algorithmic
with some like clever algorithmic
sounding thing or some like clever

formula that may or may not even be
formula that may or may not even be
correct is when people get excited in

you as well. I linked this to Finn
already.
Insights will be appreciated on the

to be able to represent any type of

be initialized by that function.
Different sizes, different weights, all
Different sizes, different weights, all
sorts of stuff. But I need to know if I

modeled it correctly or not.
have a look. Thank you.
I'm trying to make it easier for you
I'm trying to make it easier for you
guys when you try to actually run the
guys when you try to actually run the
thing on real hardware.
I'm going to have to get myself a drone
I'm going to have to get myself a drone
as well. I don't really know what to do.
as well. I don't really know what to do.
Technically, I have a park in California

where I can probably just go do take

I don't know. Can you just put a drone
I don't know. Can you just put a drone
in a in your suitcase or does TSA go
in a in your suitcase or does TSA go
insane?
Well, to get through it since I want to
Well, to get through it since I want to
do my PhD, go to engage in research.
do my PhD, go to engage in research.
Yeah, I guess the thing that's going to
Yeah, I guess the thing that's going to
keep you best grounded, right?
keep you best grounded, right?
This is the way to keep yourself from
This is the way to keep yourself from
going insane in academia. Okay, so you
going insane in academia. Okay, so you
think of your job as two parts. Part
think of your job as two parts. Part
number one is
number one is
how do I improve the field? Like how do
how do I improve the field? Like how do
I genuinely do meaningful work I care
I genuinely do meaningful work I care
about that will improve the field? And
about that will improve the field? And
part two is how do I sell it to a bunch
part two is how do I sell it to a bunch
of bookworms. All right, literally
of bookworms. All right, literally
that's all it is.
that's all it is.
Puffer li going with robotics or drones
Puffer li going with robotics or drones
or just experiment. So puffer is general

What was our previous best?
I mean, it's not by a huge margin

Welcome.
I must have done something wrong in the

see it at least learns decently well
see it at least learns decently well
pretty instantly here.
So that's the super like these are tiny

So, do you mean as part of the PR is or

for the pure C? So with the pure C, we
for the pure C? So with the pure C, we
could very easily make it so that the
could very easily make it so that the

And you're perfectly fine to do that. As

Do you program in Vim?

Yeah, it's like Neo Vim with um
Yeah, it's like Neo Vim with um
two plugins or whatever.
You can see the uh the setup I have.
Okay. So, let me sort of walk you guys
Okay. So, let me sort of walk you guys
through what I'm thinking about right
through what I'm thinking about right
now. For the uh the drone sim, we
now. For the uh the drone sim, we
currently have two different uh drone
currently have two different uh drone
simulators. We have the racing one that
simulators. We have the racing one that
I just showed you, but we also have
I just showed you, but we also have
we have this swarm drone swarm sim.
Yeah, you should do that ideally.
So, obviously these guys aren't trained

to do anything,
to do anything,
but uh the demo that I did for this the
but uh the demo that I did for this the

we literally hit 10K this morning until
we literally hit 10K this morning until

Let me find the demo I did for the drone
Let me find the demo I did for the drone
swarm.
Okay. Right. Like this.
Right.
So I think the thing that would like be
So I think the thing that would like be
really impressive and really really
really impressive and really really
generally useful, right, is if we could
generally useful, right, is if we could
just get a drone policy that does
just get a drone policy that does
everything.
everything.
Can we get a drone policy that can make
Can we get a drone policy that can make
flag constellations, that can beat human
flag constellations, that can beat human
pros at racing, that can like, you know,
pros at racing, that can like, you know,
follow targets? Just like have a policy
follow targets? Just like have a policy
that does everything.
One big environment,

different drone form factors as well.
Just make that work somehow. Yeah.
Holy retweets Batman.
I have question. What is question?

Magic.
I'll answer a few while I'm thinking
I'll answer a few while I'm thinking
about how I want to make all the drone

you can go look up the tiny box v1 and

see if they have specs.
see if they have specs.
Oh, actually, no. That's the 6GPU
Oh, actually, no. That's the 6GPU

the 4GPU machine. It's just the four uh
the 4GPU machine. It's just the four uh
the four GPU I'm all over the place
the four GPU I'm all over the place
today. The one GPU machines are uh
today. The one GPU machines are uh
they're just max spec to main gear
they're just max spec to main gear
boxes. So you can just basically just go
boxes. So you can just basically just go
over to main gear, max everything, go
over to main gear, max everything, go

Yeah. So, there are like many many ways
Yeah. So, there are like many many ways
I have of making it redundant. It just
I have of making it redundant. It just
depends on how much I want to go problem
depends on how much I want to go problem
specific versus general. So, here's what
specific versus general. So, here's what
I'm trying to figure out at the moment,
I'm trying to figure out at the moment,
right? Like most of the goals that I
right? Like most of the goals that I
have are some version of go to position
have are some version of go to position
while avoiding collisions.
The ring target is slightly different

because you have to go in from a certain

The thing is you can really

We have gotten it to work before where
We have gotten it to work before where
it's truly multitask. So you just have
it's truly multitask. So you just have
the same policy doing different stuff.

It's just all the data.
I think at the very least we can combine

the two sims that I showed you, right?
the two sims that I showed you, right?
Like the swarm sim

and the uh the racing sim.
We just give you like like an N

I'm going to say how's it going to so I
I'm going to say how's it going to so I
don't butcher your first name.
You know, one thing that would actually

be really cool, we could make a train
be really cool, we could make a train

I'd like to train in that setting

actually.
actually.
I don't know how well that would do
I don't know how well that would do
though just because of um
though just because of um
I really need to make better collision
I really need to make better collision
checks at some point. You know, like our
checks at some point. You know, like our
collision check logic is not
collision check logic is not
great at the moment just generally.
But if I scrap that for now and at least
But if I scrap that for now and at least
I just try to merge these two into one
I just try to merge these two into one
big environment, I think we can do that.
And I can just give it like tasks,
And I can just give it like tasks,
different tasks.
Okay, let's get started on that. How's

No, actually the opposite. Uh, so like

So this one is like a little bit bigger

collision stuff is it was quite a while
collision stuff is it was quite a while
ago now. It was before drone was written
ago now. It was before drone was written
in Puffalib. This was back in back in
in Puffalib. This was back in back in
the the gym days. But I spent quite a
the the gym days. But I spent quite a
long time figuring out the the maths for
long time figuring out the the maths for
proper collisions with like
proper collisions with like
it doesn't require everything to be
it doesn't require everything to be
spheres. You can have planes and kind of
spheres. You can have planes and kind of
triangular stuff as well.
triangular stuff as well.
So that's helpful. The thing I was
So that's helpful. The thing I was
talking about even simpler. It's just
talking about even simpler. It's just
the fact that collision checking is
the fact that collision checking is
quadratic at the moment.
quadratic at the moment.
Um
Um
Oh, right. Okay. Like ideally what I
Oh, right. Okay. Like ideally what I
would do is I would make some sort of
would do is I would make some sort of
even just like a basic op tree would do
even just like a basic op tree would do
it.
it.
I just don't want to actually have to do
I just don't want to actually have to do
that because it's a total pain.
that because it's a total pain.
But I will do that at some point.
But I will do that at some point.
It doesn't really matter because
It doesn't really matter because
like quadratic is fine up until like 256
like quadratic is fine up until like 256
512 agents don't even notice.
512 agents don't even notice.
So
So
anyways, let me tell you guys a little
anyways, let me tell you guys a little
bit about what I've been doing on this
bit about what I've been doing on this
and uh what I'm planning on doing here.
and uh what I'm planning on doing here.
So we now have it so that you can
So we now have it so that you can
randomize the size of the drone and then
randomize the size of the drone and then
there's also an additional randomization
there's also an additional randomization
constant or factor for physical
constant or factor for physical
properties. And what this does, so first
properties. And what this does, so first
you roll the size of the drone between I
you roll the size of the drone between I
believe it's between 5 cm and
believe it's between 5 cm and
uh like 8 mters or something
uh like 8 mters or something
five. It's it's like between a a very
five. It's it's like between a a very
small and like a mediumsiz drone, right?
small and like a mediumsiz drone, right?
And then what it does is it attempts to
And then what it does is it attempts to
estimate based on that some sort of
estimate based on that some sort of
reasonable weight and reasonable inertia
reasonable weight and reasonable inertia
parameters and all that and it
parameters and all that and it
randomizes those a little bit. So the
randomizes those a little bit. So the
idea is that you get pretty much any
idea is that you get pretty much any
sort of realistic or even somewhat
sort of realistic or even somewhat
unrealistic
unrealistic
drone imaginable. So it needs to it
drone imaginable. So it needs to it
should be able to learn to fly any type
should be able to learn to fly any type
of drone with the same policy.
Right. Okay.
Right. Okay.
So
So
where did you get those? Um I saw there
where did you get those? Um I saw there
were some sort of horistics about
were some sort of horistics about
choosing the the sizes and things. Where
choosing the the sizes and things. Where
where did you get those from? They just
where did you get those from? They just
kind of
kind of
freaking rock.
freaking rock.
Yeah. Fair enough.
Yeah. Fair enough.
Yeah. So, some of them are kind of
Yeah. So, some of them are kind of
obvious, right? Like mass should roughly
obvious, right? Like mass should roughly
scale the size cubed. No.
Uh yeah. Yeah.
Uh yeah. Yeah.
Right. Because it's it's if mass is
Right. Because it's it's if mass is
distributed evenly, trying to guess that
distributed evenly, trying to guess that
one
one
and then like some of the other ones
and then like some of the other ones
make sense and some of the other ones
make sense and some of the other ones
are more heristic.
are more heristic.
Um
Um
hello. So, I basically I wanted you guys
hello. So, I basically I wanted you guys
to take a look at those and see if
to take a look at those and see if
they're reasonable because what we would
they're reasonable because what we would
like to see in the sim is we would like
like to see in the sim is we would like
to see the drones handling more or less
to see the drones handling more or less
the way that you would expect. I haven't
the way that you would expect. I haven't
really seen a ton about the drones, like
really seen a ton about the drones, like
actually flying them. Uh, which I we
actually flying them. Uh, which I we
should probably all do that at some
should probably all do that at some
point, but you'd expect that the smaller
point, but you'd expect that the smaller
ones are going to be zippier and have
ones are going to be zippier and have
really tight turning radiuses, right?
really tight turning radiuses, right?
And then the bigger ones are going to
And then the bigger ones are going to
have a lot more weight and inertia to
have a lot more weight and inertia to
them. So, we'd like to see that happen
them. So, we'd like to see that happen
in the sim, right? That's the goal. And
in the sim, right? That's the goal. And
then you can fly any drone with one
then you can fly any drone with one
policy. And then the next thing I'm
policy. And then the next thing I'm
doing is I'm going to actually make it
doing is I'm going to actually make it
so the same policy can do a ton of
so the same policy can do a ton of
different tasks. So, like not only will
different tasks. So, like not only will
you have a policy that can be a
you have a policy that can be a
ridiculously good race uh drone racer,
ridiculously good race uh drone racer,
but at the same time like the same
but at the same time like the same
policy should be able to go make the
policy should be able to go make the
flag or like orbit in a sphere or do any
flag or like orbit in a sphere or do any
of the other tasks because they're all
of the other tasks because they're all
some form of go to point with the ring.
some form of go to point with the ring.
It's like go to point from the right
It's like go to point from the right
side, but no big deal. Same thing.
side, but no big deal. Same thing.
Uh, so we should basically be able to
Uh, so we should basically be able to
train it on a huge number of randomized
train it on a huge number of randomized
tasks and randomized drones. And then
tasks and randomized drones. And then
with that much diversity in the policy,
with that much diversity in the policy,
there's probably going to be some
there's probably going to be some
fiddling around to get it to work on the
fiddling around to get it to work on the
real hardware, but uh, that's it.
real hardware, but uh, that's it.
Hey, I see it's here. Welcome.
Hey, I see it's here. Welcome.
Hello.
Hello.
I appreciate all the work that you guys
I appreciate all the work that you guys
have done, especially like just having
have done, especially like just having
the actual source and being able to run
the actual source and being able to run
it and look at it and
it and look at it and
change it, see things break, change it,
change it, see things break, change it,
see things improve has been super like
see things improve has been super like
useful for my learning. So, I really
useful for my learning. So, I really
really appreciate it.
really appreciate it.
Hey man, I am trying. It's uh
Hey man, I am trying. It's uh
cool. If you've if you saw the process
cool. If you've if you saw the process
of getting it to where it is now over
of getting it to where it is now over
the last year, like first it was Python
the last year, like first it was Python
with this emulation wrapper over
with this emulation wrapper over
existing gym and then we went to Syon
existing gym and then we went to Syon
and then we had like prototype binding C
and then we had like prototype binding C
API stuff and then we got something and
API stuff and then we got something and
had like horrible memory leaks and then
had like horrible memory leaks and then
this we got something that's pretty dang
this we got something that's pretty dang
good now. I still hate the fact that we
good now. I still hate the fact that we
have as much like as many files as we
have as much like as many files as we
have for binding layers and this and
have for binding layers and this and
that, but it's Python makes it really
that, but it's Python makes it really
obnoxious to like get it any simpler
obnoxious to like get it any simpler
than this.
than this.
The binding C is like a hundred times
The binding C is like a hundred times
better than before. I I hated this
better than before. I I hated this
hyphen. It was just rubbish.
hyphen. It was just rubbish.
I like pulled all the code and I now
I like pulled all the code and I now
have one train.py, one eval.py, one
have one train.py, one eval.py, one
env.py, pi and one cbindings.c C file
env.py, pi and one cbindings.c C file
just by like moving working off of it
just by like moving working off of it
and then I'm importing your vectorzation
and then I'm importing your vectorzation
stuff which I I still don't understand
stuff which I I still don't understand
what that does but all the other stuff
what that does but all the other stuff
we have isn't it
we have isn't it
like we have puffer lip if you think
like we have puffer lip if you think
about it there's one trainer file there
about it there's one trainer file there
is the vectorzation file there is for
is the vectorzation file there is for
each environment and this is a slightly
each environment and this is a slightly
annoying bit right each environment has
annoying bit right each environment has
a python file it has a binding file it
a python file it has a binding file it
has ah file where all the code is and
has ah file where all the code is and
then the C file is just so that you can
then the C file is just so that you can
play with it in pure C, right? So you
play with it in pure C, right? So you
don't have to dev with the compile to
don't have to dev with the compile to
Python every time.
Python every time.
Yes, that's that's pretty much like
Yes, that's that's pretty much like
close to my setup too. It's it's I mean
close to my setup too. It's it's I mean
for what it's pretty much copied to your
for what it's pretty much copied to your
setup, right? So it's the same code as
setup, right? So it's the same code as
well. So I mean
well. So I mean
I think I think the actual sauce the
I think I think the actual sauce the
sauce is like the trainer the there's
sauce is like the trainer the there's
like that CUDA thing that you've done
like that CUDA thing that you've done
and then also the vectorzation file
and then also the vectorzation file
which I think just
which I think just
compiles it with certain flags or
compiles it with certain flags or
something. I'm not sure what that does
something. I'm not sure what that does
to be honest.
to be honest.
What the vectorzation file? Yeah, like
What the vectorzation file? Yeah, like
the VC VC enth I just I can kind of
the VC VC enth I just I can kind of
guess.
guess.
Oh, that's so what that is that is sort
Oh, that's so what that is that is sort
of like a Python implementation of N
of like a Python implementation of N
pool if you've seen that.
pool if you've seen that.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
So it's pure Python but everything is
So it's pure Python but everything is
done through shared memory. So the
done through shared memory. So the
secret source of puffer lib being fast
secret source of puffer lib being fast
with C is that when you are writing your

environment the observations are going

directly into shared memory that's
directly into shared memory that's
available immediately on the main thread

with no redundant copy operations.
with no redundant copy operations.
Okay. Yeah. I actually have done
Okay. Yeah. I actually have done
something similar with doing Conway's
something similar with doing Conway's
game of life with a Go server that was
game of life with a Go server that was
pushing packets to a website which would
pushing packets to a website which would
render it and I had this double
render it and I had this double
buffering thing happening with CUDA and
buffering thing happening with CUDA and
uh it would just you kind of have to
uh it would just you kind of have to
control the memory to keep things really
control the memory to keep things really
really quick.
really quick.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh so it's it is most of our stuff is
Uh so it's it is most of our stuff is
double buffered. Uh it supports more
double buffered. Uh it supports more
than that. You can triple or quad
than that. You can triple or quad
buffer. For instance, in Puffer 2, we
buffer. For instance, in Puffer 2, we
actually had it so you could do full
actually had it so you could do full
async. So, it's not even buffered. It
async. So, it's not even buffered. It
just takes data as it's ready.
just takes data as it's ready.
We got rid of that for now in 3.0
We got rid of that for now in 3.0
because
because
it breaks the way that our new trainer
it breaks the way that our new trainer
collects segments. Um, okay. The other
collects segments. Um, okay. The other
secret sauce. Did you read the uh like
secret sauce. Did you read the uh like
the puffing up PO article? It's super
the puffing up PO article? It's super
short.
short.
I will read it soon. I've been mostly
I will read it soon. I've been mostly
just heads down.
just heads down.
Yeah, I got
Yeah, I got
running training running your training
running training running your training
loop over and over again. Changing the
loop over and over again. Changing the
environment.

Yeah. a training loop.
Yeah. a training loop.
There are a couple things we're doing
There are a couple things we're doing
that are non-standard that will probably
that are non-standard that will probably
benefit you to understand. Um,
benefit you to understand. Um,
so we're not quite doing PO. It is built
so we're not quite doing PO. It is built
on PO, but we've done our own research
on PO, but we've done our own research
and advancements. It's a generational
and advancements. It's a generational
leap over PO. Uh, everybody claims that
leap over PO. Uh, everybody claims that
and they are all wrong. Ours actually
and they are all wrong. Ours actually
does work.
does work.
Uh, and the reason that we know that is
Uh, and the reason that we know that is
because it's 40,000 experiments.
because it's 40,000 experiments.
Yes, I've been like running it and using
Yes, I've been like running it and using
it over and over again and it actually
it over and over again and it actually
just it's actually kind of remarkable
just it's actually kind of remarkable
how easily it works. It's pretty pretty
how easily it works. It's pretty pretty
astounding to be honest.
astounding to be honest.
So that that article has all of the
So that that article has all of the
advancements that made that possible. Uh
advancements that made that possible. Uh
it's a pretty simple set of
it's a pretty simple set of
modifications to PO but like the stuff
modifications to PO but like the stuff
that actually mattered honestly muon was
that actually mattered honestly muon was
a big part of it and then I think
a big part of it and then I think
trajectory segment filtering was the
trajectory segment filtering was the
other big part and then the other stuff
other big part and then the other stuff
was more minor.
was more minor.
Okay. When are we getting voltage and
Okay. When are we getting voltage and
drone flags?

Yeah, I mean it's like when I see
Yeah, I mean it's like when I see
something that's like sick for me, like

I'm very intentional about sharing it as
I'm very intentional about sharing it as
much as I can. I have a lot of reach and

yeah,
yeah,
you can see mine is much smaller and
you can see mine is much smaller and
more concentrated. Like I very rarely

post things outside of direct RL. So
post things outside of direct RL. So
it's like a really just like poor tech
it's like a really just like poor tech
poor technical audience.

And I think part of the reason I don't
And I think part of the reason I don't
I've never planned to actually have this
I've never planned to actually have this
much reach. And I think the reason I
much reach. And I think the reason I
have this much reach is because I change
have this much reach is because I change
interests every three months. I get like

hyper obsessed about something. Right
hyper obsessed about something. Right
now it's like reinforcement learning and

So I'm going to gain some followers who
So I'm going to gain some followers who
are like, "Oh, this person's posting
are like, "Oh, this person's posting
about robot control." And then like next

week it'll be woodworking and then I'll
week it'll be woodworking and then I'll
gain some followers who are talking
gain some followers who are talking
about woodworking. But if you keep on

now like as I understand it like that

you're trying to push the drone policy
you're trying to push the drone policy

like a number of different sub areas
like a number of different sub areas
trying to do RL and it's everybody just
trying to do RL and it's everybody just
underestimates the price of complexity
underestimates the price of complexity
and now that's true in software
and now that's true in software
generally but it's especially true in
generally but it's especially true in
reinforcement learning is
reinforcement learning is
when stuff just breaks, you don't get
when stuff just breaks, you don't get
error message. You just get the thing
error message. You just get the thing
doesn't train, right?
doesn't train, right?
So like the
So like the
in fact I'm even guilty of this. So when
in fact I'm even guilty of this. So when
I first got in like when I was newish to
I first got in like when I was newish to
RL even a couple years in and clean RL
RL even a couple years in and clean RL
was becoming a thing I just thought okay
was becoming a thing I just thought okay
this is dumb why you just have like this
this is dumb why you just have like this
300line script and that was I've never
300line script and that was I've never
been more wrong about something
been more wrong about something
technically. Clean RL is a godsend and
technically. Clean RL is a godsend and
like if you actually want to see the
like if you actually want to see the
person who made all this stuff possible
person who made all this stuff possible
it's Costa. He's like the only person in
it's Costa. He's like the only person in
the field who I have literally nothing
the field who I have literally nothing
bad whatsoever to say. He's just
bad whatsoever to say. He's just
pioneered all this stuff. And his
pioneered all this stuff. And his
insight was like, what if we just do
insight was like, what if we just do
this in the simplest way possible and
this in the simplest way possible and
make it super hackable? And what I've
make it super hackable? And what I've
done with Puffer is try to keep it as
done with Puffer is try to keep it as
simple as possible while also making it
simple as possible while also making it
fast. Um,
fast. Um,
I mean, it's like I can be like I I can
I mean, it's like I can be like I I can
testify that it is a very hackable. I
testify that it is a very hackable. I
mean, I literally just went to the
mean, I literally just went to the
Python package, pit package, and I just
Python package, pit package, and I just
read the code and I copied things over
read the code and I copied things over
and it like literally just worked. I
and it like literally just worked. I
mean, that's that's a core feature.
mean, that's that's a core feature.
I mean, that's exactly right. Like,
I mean, that's exactly right. Like,
you're kind of like iterating on this
you're kind of like iterating on this
like over and over again, doing newer
like over and over again, doing newer
and newer versions and pushing um
and newer versions and pushing um
pushing things uh simpler and simpler
pushing things uh simpler and simpler
and like that that's like the main
and like that that's like the main
feature of like any codebase. Like I
feature of like any codebase. Like I
judge a codebase for me a codebase
judge a codebase for me a codebase
codebase's value is determined by how
codebase's value is determined by how
easy is the codebase to change to my
easy is the codebase to change to my
requirements the thing that I want for

Uh no this is the first time I've ever
Uh no this is the first time I've ever
trained RL models. I've actually so two
trained RL models. I've actually so two
weeks ago I started with Mujoko and I
weeks ago I started with Mujoko and I
was I got a hot dog to to balance and
was I got a hot dog to to balance and
that was kind of like I wish I could go
that was kind of like I wish I could go
to like I I hate Jax. I don't like XLA.
to like I I hate Jax. I don't like XLA.
Like I don't know what the it's
Like I don't know what the it's
doing. What is it even doing? Yeah, I
doing. What is it even doing? Yeah, I
don't either.
don't either.
So, and but with this it's like I I can
So, and but with this it's like I I can
understand like PyTorch functional is is
understand like PyTorch functional is is
my is my Um PyTorch like I can
my is my Um PyTorch like I can
just read it. I can understand what's
just read it. I can understand what's
what it's actually doing. Uh the C is
what it's actually doing. Uh the C is
like I can read it. I can understand
like I can read it. I can understand
what it's doing. I can write any
what it's doing. I can write any
renderer I want. I can plug it into
renderer I want. I can plug it into
RLIB. I can plug plug it into like
RLIB. I can plug plug it into like
terminal output. Like it doesn't
terminal output. Like it doesn't
matter. Um and I that's the most
matter. Um and I that's the most
important thing is I I can understand
important thing is I I can understand
it. I can I know what's actually
it. I can I know what's actually
happening. And when I understand things
happening. And when I understand things
at their fundamental level, then I can
at their fundamental level, then I can
understand what's possible to do. And I
understand what's possible to do. And I
mean I'm I'm getting really excited
mean I'm I'm getting really excited
because I mean the thing I'm trying to
because I mean the thing I'm trying to
do is kind of uh it's I'm trying to uh
do is kind of uh it's I'm trying to uh
meme. Uh so I have a hard hat which I
meme. Uh so I have a hard hat which I
bought because I was at with my kid.
bought because I was at with my kid.
It was right next to the Chinese place I
It was right next to the Chinese place I
was ordering food from. And I want to
was ordering food from. And I want to
make it fly and I think like I can make
make it fly and I think like I can make
it fly. Doesn't seem that like
it fly. Doesn't seem that like
complicated to simulate. I mean if if I
complicated to simulate. I mean if if I
can run your code and hack on your code
can run your code and hack on your code
that's like making a a drone fly. And I
that's like making a a drone fly. And I
I also added I I know you guys are
I also added I I know you guys are
working on domain randomization and I
working on domain randomization and I
did that yesterday. I added mass
did that yesterday. I added mass
randomization. Um, and
randomization. Um, and
oh, take a look at the function we added
oh, take a look at the function we added
for that. So, it can now fly like all
for that. So, it can now fly like all
different sizes of drones with like kind
different sizes of drones with like kind
of reasonableish estimates and
of reasonableish estimates and
randomized masses, lengths, inertia. Um,
randomized masses, lengths, inertia. Um,
there's a whole bunch of stuff and it it
there's a whole bunch of stuff and it it
still flies like all sorts of different
still flies like all sorts of different
drones.
drones.
It's it's kind of remarkable like I I
It's it's kind of remarkable like I I
trained them I didn't train a new neural
trained them I didn't train a new neural
network
network
and it was still able to fly ever. Yeah,
and it was still able to fly ever. Yeah,
it was it's it's kind of neural networks
it was it's it's kind of neural networks
are actually kind of amazing. Uh, neural
are actually kind of amazing. Uh, neural
networks are are are actually
networks are are are actually
remarkable. And so so I guess I'll give
remarkable. And so so I guess I'll give
you it's so small. It it'll run
you it's so small. It it'll run
on a potato.
on a potato.
Yeah, dude. It'll run on a potato. Like
Yeah, dude. It'll run on a potato. Like
this is this is I don't understand any.
this is this is I don't understand any.
Anyways, um I'm very excited. Uh so I'll
Anyways, um I'm very excited. Uh so I'll
give you guys some advice about this is
give you guys some advice about this is
how I'm going to go about getting my
how I'm going to go about getting my
hard hat to fly. I'm going to 3D print a
hard hat to fly. I'm going to 3D print a
vertical a vertical thing, which is
vertical a vertical thing, which is
basically like a modulation of like some
basically like a modulation of like some
some aluminum extrusion, right? And I'm
some aluminum extrusion, right? And I'm
going to attach that to a brushless
going to attach that to a brushless
motor so it can only go up and down. So
motor so it can only go up and down. So
I'm going to put some WD40 on it. I'm
I'm going to put some WD40 on it. I'm
going to have a Newton meter at the
going to have a Newton meter at the
bottom of it. And I'm going to make the
bottom of it. And I'm going to make the
brushless motor. I'm just going to send
brushless motor. I'm just going to send
ESC commands to it to set at a certain
ESC commands to it to set at a certain
speed. And I'm going to measure the rate
speed. And I'm going to measure the rate
at which the speed can change, at which
at which the speed can change, at which
the force can change. And I'm going to
the force can change. And I'm going to
try to model it the best I can in an
try to model it the best I can in an
environment. And then I'm going to model
environment. And then I'm going to model
the environment and then have it like
the environment and then have it like
basically randomize. And then I'm going
basically randomize. And then I'm going
to try to do some tore to that. Yeah.
to try to do some tore to that. Yeah.
Exactly. Then I'm going to move it over.
Exactly. Then I'm going to move it over.
And basically the goal will be try to
And basically the goal will be try to
float halfway through the thing. And I
float halfway through the thing. And I
think it will work. Um, and there's the
think it will work. Um, and there's the
way I'm going to measure the the length
way I'm going to measure the the length
that it's going to be. Uh, I haven't
that it's going to be. Uh, I haven't
figured out yet, but it it seems like it
figured out yet, but it it seems like it
should be that not too too difficult to
should be that not too too difficult to
do. I could probably even do it just
do. I could probably even do it just
computer vision. Um, but once I have it
computer vision. Um, but once I have it
working on one axis, then I'm going to
working on one axis, then I'm going to
move over to actually get having
move over to actually get having
something fly. I feel like that's going
something fly. I feel like that's going
to be a little bit easier and it's also
to be a little bit easier and it's also
going to like shorten the time where I
going to like shorten the time where I
actually have symptoms. Like like my
actually have symptoms. Like like my
goal right now is like I need Sim to
goal right now is like I need Sim to
reel today. If I want my hard hat to fly
reel today. If I want my hard hat to fly
by, let's say Tuesday, I need SIM to
by, let's say Tuesday, I need SIM to
reel to work today. And I don't think I
reel to work today. And I don't think I
can get my hard hat to fly today, I
can get my hard hat to fly today, I
probably can get this 3D printed this 3D
probably can get this 3D printed this 3D
printed thing and I can get a brushless
printed thing and I can get a brushless
motor and I can have it have it like uh
motor and I can have it have it like uh
have it have it have it create some
have it have it have it create some
thrust. Like I can try that, right? Like
thrust. Like I can try that, right? Like
and the thing I'm I'm trying to like do
and the thing I'm I'm trying to like do
is like reduce the reduce the amount of
is like reduce the reduce the amount of
requirements such that I get to a point.
requirements such that I get to a point.
I think like doing a I mean I could
I think like doing a I mean I could
possibly get a drone as well and um
possibly get a drone as well and um
simil I think we can get that to work
simil I think we can get that to work
for you. It's like I pretty much just
for you. It's like I pretty much just
have to show you the way that we
have to show you the way that we
actually domain randomize stuff. Um it's
actually domain randomize stuff. Um it's
a lot harder with actual super
a lot harder with actual super
highdimensional robotics because you
highdimensional robotics because you
can't randomize all the relevant stuff,
can't randomize all the relevant stuff,
but I think it shouldn't be that hard
but I think it shouldn't be that hard
with something like this.
with something like this.
I mean I have it working with mass and
I mean I have it working with mass and
it works pretty well. Like the the only
it works pretty well. Like the the only
it fails on 0. So, I have the mass
it fails on 0. So, I have the mass
randomizing from 0.1 kg to 3.5. It works
randomizing from 0.1 kg to 3.5. It works
above 0.5 to 3.5 kg. I actually just
above 0.5 to 3.5 kg. I actually just
like went out to Costco and I just
like went out to Costco and I just
trained a model for
trained a model for
uh as long as it like I trained it for
uh as long as it like I trained it for
like 500 million instead of one I can't
like 500 million instead of one I can't
even remember. I just like added a bunch
even remember. I just like added a bunch
of zeros to it.
of zeros to it.
Um so I'm going to try that and see if
Um so I'm going to try that and see if
that works. But I mean I don't know. And
that works. But I mean I don't know. And
like I'm excited too because like just
like I'm excited too because like just
the 30 second training loop dude just
the 30 second training loop dude just
means that you can actually
means that you can actually
hyperparameter sweep.
hyperparameter sweep.
Have you tried 13 yet? No, I have not.
Have you tried 13 yet? No, I have not.
I'm really excited.
I'm really excited.
You have to get it set up properly. Uh
You have to get it set up properly. Uh
there's one obnoxious quirk with it that
there's one obnoxious quirk with it that
I didn't have time to fix before 3 0. Um
I didn't have time to fix before 3 0. Um
that it doesn't like always work the way
that it doesn't like always work the way
it's supposed to work perfectly, but
it's supposed to work perfectly, but
when it does, like this is how we got
when it does, like this is how we got
breakout speed running. Solve breakout
breakout speed running. Solve breakout
under 20 seconds. Solve pawn in 3
under 20 seconds. Solve pawn in 3
seconds. It's our own hyperparameter
seconds. It's our own hyperparameter
tuning algorithm. Like you can read the
tuning algorithm. Like you can read the
article on it. I actually had to do some
article on it. I actually had to do some
math for once for that.
math for once for that.
Okay, I'll I'll I'll read it. And I
Okay, I'll I'll I'll read it. And I
think that like
think that like
they're all pretty short and easy to
they're all pretty short and easy to
read. The way I have things pulled out
read. The way I have things pulled out
basically means that I'll be able to
basically means that I'll be able to
like rip out what you guys are doing and
like rip out what you guys are doing and
I actually just like run it on my own
I actually just like run it on my own
thing because I have like really strange
thing because I have like really strange
infrastructure like
infrastructure like
again like I have like a train.sh which
again like I have like a train.sh which
you know sends my code over to my server
you know sends my code over to my server
rebuilds the Python bindings trains it

know open a pipelot on my on my on my on
know open a pipelot on my on my on my on
my laptop every like uh every like x
my laptop every like uh every like x
amount of epochs and then um
amount of epochs and then um
you can do that. I feel like yeah
you can do that. I feel like yeah
if you want to replicate existing stuff
if you want to replicate existing stuff
I'd suggest at least not dropping the
I'd suggest at least not dropping the
core features that we have because like
core features that we have because like
it's a small set and they're really
it's a small set and they're really
useful like the local dashboard for
useful like the local dashboard for
instance that we have is really useful
instance that we have is really useful
for fixing performance bugs. Um the
for fixing performance bugs. Um the
Neptune

that I kept like the the dashboard I
that I kept like the the dashboard I
kept. It's like very very useful to just
kept. It's like very very useful to just
see it like actually ripping and like
see it like actually ripping and like
when I make a clear mistake it's like
when I make a clear mistake it's like
the the numbers look and yeah or

sorry for cursing but yeah.
sorry for cursing but yeah.
So you don't super need over like just a
So you don't super need over like just a
pie plot thing for individual runs. When
pie plot thing for individual runs. When
it's really helpful is when you have
it's really helpful is when you have
sweeps and you need like scatters for
sweeps and you need like scatters for
every hyperp because you're like doing
every hyperp because you're like doing
sensitivity analysis and stuff.
sensitivity analysis and stuff.
Okay.
Okay.
Like that's that's what that's for. like
Like that's that's what that's for. like
we there's more advanced analysis
we there's more advanced analysis
basically that that stuff supports.
basically that that stuff supports.
Um I don't like it either. I don't like
Um I don't like it either. I don't like
that. They all suck, but like you need
that. They all suck, but like you need
something that does it.
something that does it.
What I'm doing is I'm dumping all the
What I'm doing is I'm dumping all the
logs to a JSON line file and then I just
logs to a JSON line file and then I just
like open that up with like a notebook
like open that up with like a notebook
and I just like hack with plots that I
and I just like hack with plots that I
need to. So I feel like I mean I can
need to. So I feel like I mean I can
generate
generate
that you'd want to generate it's going
that you'd want to generate it's going
to be like last data point scatters over
to be like last data point scatters over
a bunch of different hypers and it's
a bunch of different hypers and it's
going to be like scatter of hyperprem
going to be like scatter of hyperprem
versus four or

yeah yeah
yeah yeah
those like fancy plots where it like
those like fancy plots where it like
changes colors and stuff.
changes colors and stuff.
Uh Snapchat doesn't even have that

properly. I asked for that but yeah it's
ideally you do some nice stuff with

not have to sync stuff. But
not have to sync stuff. But
all those apps suck. They're all super
all those apps suck. They're all super
slow and bloated. So man,
slow and bloated. So man,
yes,
yes,
they're very slow and bloated. You know
they're very slow and bloated. You know

right? Like if you if you get I mean
right? Like if you if you get I mean
here's here's let me give you an
here's here's let me give you an
example. Okay. If you take my uh hard
example. Okay. If you take my uh hard
hat code and you open a box

and a hard hat flies out and it lands on
and a hard hat flies out and it lands on
your head perfectly,

do you think I'm you could sell anything
do you think I'm you could sell anything
to anyone if you can do that? If you can

the box and the hard hat flies out and
the box and the hard hat flies out and
it lands on your head, I will buy
it lands on your head, I will buy
anything from you. If you tell me I I

I'll build $10,000 an hour, I'll be
I'll build $10,000 an hour, I'll be
like, I'll give you 20. Um, if you can
like, I'll give you 20. Um, if you can
make a hard because no one can do that.
make a hard because no one can do that.
That's And here's another thing from
That's And here's another thing from
demos like that is that like the thing
demos like that is that like the thing
is I guess they're not as easy like
is I guess they're not as easy like
visually obvious as that and that's what
visually obvious as that and that's what
we're working on. We have all sorts of
we're working on. We have all sorts of
demos that if you have any idea about RL
demos that if you have any idea about RL
are like nuts. Um,
are like nuts. Um,
yes.
yes.
It's just like flying hard hat isn't a

But how hard would it be for you to turn
But how hard would it be for you to turn
that into a product? Right. Effectively,
that into a product? Right. Effectively,
for you to like create an actual
for you to like create an actual
physical product, you would have to
physical product, you would have to
raise the capital to do it. But what you
raise the capital to do it. But what you
can do is you can go to a customer who
can do is you can go to a customer who
already has a bunch of capital and
already has a bunch of capital and
you're like, "Hey, I'll create this

Um,
Um,
basically reinforcement learning killed

yep,
yep,
it they literally like they made slower
it they literally like they made slower

no,
no,
I mean, I think that I could actually

I'm getting back in shape. What I did uh
I'm getting back in shape. What I did uh
I have I'm not there at the moment, but
I have I'm not there at the moment, but
the the warehouse streams I have all the
the the warehouse streams I have all the
weights behind me and I just
weights behind me and I just
Yeah, dude. I saw you had you had an
Yeah, dude. I saw you had you had an
American flag and actually like behind
American flag and actually like behind
me I have a squat rack myself and I have
me I have a squat rack myself and I have
a Canadian flag. So, you know,
a Canadian flag. So, you know,
I got to get my uh I got patella
I got to get my uh I got patella
tendonitis. I got to get that fixed so I
tendonitis. I got to get that fixed so I
can squat again. Deadlift is back up to
can squat again. Deadlift is back up to
like 350 four some reps though. So, I
like 350 four some reps though. So, I
don't know. I haven't tried to max it
don't know. I haven't tried to max it
lately, but it's getting close to back.
lately, but it's getting close to back.
I I'm getting a little older and my uh
I I'm getting a little older and my uh
approach to weightlifting is I don't go
approach to weightlifting is I don't go
over what is like what a regular strong
over what is like what a regular strong
dude would do and I just make sure to do
dude would do and I just make sure to do
it for higher reps because I'm kind of
it for higher reps because I'm kind of
worried about just like messing my
worried about just like messing my
up.

Yeah. I honestly it's like repetitive
Yeah. I honestly it's like repetitive

been all my injuries. Not even just

Okay. Interesting. Yeah.

600 pounds is insane though.
600 pounds is insane though.
No, 600 is uh that's very different from

I've been kind of studying hard sciences

trying to think about this stuff. But

Then I can probably do something early

The thing is that I would need to here's

that just it takes a long time to learn

and even if I write it there, the thing
and even if I write it there, the thing
is like frankly, you really can't just

Yes. There's there's things that people
Yes. There's there's things that people
will do that like once they master

where I can run these scripts and

actually just have it pop
actually just have it pop
every 30 every 30 seconds because I've

and they just won't even listen to me.

like they don't they won't take me
like they don't they won't take me
seriously because
seriously because
they'll agree with it but they won't

actually act on it because it you'd have
actually act on it because it you'd have
to be a little bit insane to do what I'm
to be a little bit insane to do what I'm
doing with like setting up this much
doing with like setting up this much
infrastructure just to get a fast dev

most important thing having a super

tight dev loop is the most important
tight dev loop is the most important
thing which is like I mean like honestly

the mujoko train the MJX training loop

so and it was killing me it was actually

That's awful.
That's awful.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, like at that point, like I would

even if I was a bookworm, I'd be like,
even if I was a bookworm, I'd be like,
I've had enough. I'm going to learn.
I've had enough. I'm going to learn.
But they can't because every time you

That's awful.
Yeah. Because it's like, okay, well, if
Yeah. Because it's like, okay, well, if
I just here like one of the first

obvious things did was what happens if I

just 10x the or like 100x the batch size
just 10x the or like 100x the batch size
for Atari, right? It's like, okay, cool.
for Atari, right? It's like, okay, cool.
You can actually get Atari to go from
You can actually get Atari to go from
500 steps per second training to like
500 steps per second training to like
20,000 steps per second training. That's
20,000 steps per second training. That's
at least like kind of something horrible
at least like kind of something horrible
by today's standards, but it would have
by today's standards, but it would have
been good by back then. The thing is
been good by back then. The thing is
then what they'll do is say, "Oh, you

That's

We were trying to like this is actually
We were trying to like this is actually
one of the things that really pissed me

off. So I talk about research being

Literally just take run a perf test on a

be able to be like 64x faster or
be able to be like 64x faster or
whatever. Is is it 64x for 128? I
whatever. Is is it 64x for 128? I
believe so. All right. It's not 64x
believe so. All right. It's not 64x
faster. It's like 3x faster. Well, then
faster. It's like 3x faster. Well, then
there's like a gap of 20x. Duh.
there's like a gap of 20x. Duh.
Yep.
Yep.

That's it.

How fun. Uh, one of the things I was
How fun. Uh, one of the things I was
thinking about like simplifying stuff on
thinking about like simplifying stuff on
on my end. If I had the time to do this,
on my end. If I had the time to do this,
I would probably have ended up doing
I would probably have ended up doing
this is doing the pietorch from C. Just
this is doing the pietorch from C. Just
like calling PyTorch bindings from C and

Uh
Uh
yeah, if I do that, nobody else would
yeah, if I do that, nobody else would
use my stuff.
use my stuff.
That's a problem. E
That's a problem. E
and it's not I wish if PyTorch actually

Oh.
Oh.
Yeah, it's annoying.
Yeah, it's annoying.
Yeah, Python it is.
Yeah, Python it is.
Yeah, I really don't like the way it's
Yeah, I really don't like the way it's
set up. Um I I wish I could just write

that much pro that much progress. If

I never got into functional at all. And
I never got into functional at all. And
I I think it's kind of just as bad as
I I think it's kind of just as bad as
object-oriented.
object-oriented.
Like I
Like I
I don't like mutable state is necessary
I don't like mutable state is necessary
for Perf and it's often the simplest
for Perf and it's often the simplest
thing as well. It's the classes. So I
thing as well. It's the classes. So I
actually I tried to do like full
actually I tried to do like full
procedural stuff in Python and the
procedural stuff in Python and the
result was just really really stupid
result was just really really stupid
code and it took me a while to
code and it took me a while to
understand why and it wasn't that I was
understand why and it wasn't that I was
doing anything wrong. It's that the
doing anything wrong. It's that the
language itself like languages force you
language itself like languages force you
into a specific way of doing things. So
into a specific way of doing things. So
when people say the language doesn't
when people say the language doesn't
matter, it actually does because like

try to write C style code in Python, it
try to write C style code in Python, it
won't work.
won't work.
Yeah, that's true. I really hate Python,
Yeah, that's true. I really hate Python,
man. you know the language is if you
man. you know the language is if you
just say fine I'll write classes I won't
just say fine I'll write classes I won't
use inheritance I'll just write basic
use inheritance I'll just write basic
classes you know it's not that different
classes you know it's not that different
from just if you have it's not that
from just if you have it's not that
different to have like the first param

the thing I hate about Python's the

And what are all these questions here?
And what are all these questions here?
Supply chain.
Supply chain.
That's not scale. Scale needs when you
That's not scale. Scale needs when you
integrate with other systems or third
integrate with other systems or third
party. Cool. Not only is my code a
party. Cool. Not only is my code a
thousand times faster, I also have a
thousand times faster, I also have a
hundred times less of it than everyone
hundred times less of it than everyone
else. It's way easier to integrate like
else. It's way easier to integrate like
tiny amount of code than it is to
tiny amount of code than it is to
integrate huge amount of code because I
integrate huge amount of code because I
can just rewrite little components
can just rewrite little components
wherever I need. And I can actually do
wherever I need. And I can actually do
that in like an hour instead of having
that in like an hour instead of having
to spend a whole bunch of time thinking

about this big thing.

And I do this constantly.

So I haven't This is why I've say low

into high fidelity control unless it's

tied to a big contract because I would
tied to a big contract because I would
basically have to really get into I
basically have to really get into I
wouldn't just have to get into like
wouldn't just have to get into like
Isaac lab and Isixson to understand
Isaac lab and Isixson to understand
this. I'd have to go into physics and
this. I'd have to go into physics and
stuff, right? Because it's pretty

obvious to me that a six degree of

as the current sims are just because

But it understanding exactly why and how

Could you not just like look at Mujoko

they simulate things like I feel like
they simulate things like I feel like
you just plug that into puffer and it
you just plug that into puffer and it
should just work. Uh, so high dem high

GPU is the thing.
GPU is the thing.
Okay.
Okay.
Like and by the way, you know, when I
Like and by the way, you know, when I
say it should be on GPU, the cool thing
say it should be on GPU, the cool thing
about puffer, you can kind of just copy
about puffer, you can kind of just copy
paste puffer code into CUDA. CUDA is
paste puffer code into CUDA. CUDA is
just C. We've kind of done that. Like
just C. We've kind of done that. Like
did you see the uh the Puffer advantage
did you see the uh the Puffer advantage

right?
right?
I feel like I've So, do you ever feel
I feel like I've So, do you ever feel
angry that all these people are
angry that all these people are
abstracting things things away from you,

preventing you from realizing how simple

Yes. Which is why I've built all the

stuff around Puffer and I yell at people

when they do that.
when they do that.
Right.
Right.
I like I yell at people from abstracting
I like I yell at people from abstracting
stuff. That's like the second most
stuff. That's like the second most
common thing I yell at people for. The
common thing I yell at people for. The
only thing that I will actually really
only thing that I will actually really
flame you over is breaking something

I I I I used to have a problem with

making mistakes. I I I have a little
making mistakes. I I I have a little
trouble reading things which is like not

very good for a programmer. And I used
very good for a programmer. And I used
to make a lot of mistakes when reviewing

people's PRs or making my own PRs at
people's PRs or making my own PRs at

work. So what I learned is actually like
I just like sit there with a pencil and
I just like sit there with a pencil and
I read code line by line before I merge
I read code line by line before I merge
every single time because I will make

people don't actually do that like they

do people keep on adding a complexity?

So, actually the thing that I would
So, actually the thing that I would
really like to have, which Have you ever
really like to have, which Have you ever
used Syon?
used Syon?
I know.
I know.
So, Syon is like you can write Python
So, Syon is like you can write Python
and you can write C in the same file.
and you can write C in the same file.
Oh, wow.
Oh, wow.
Uh it's great in concept. In practice,
Uh it's great in concept. In practice,
the compiler is a buggy mess and like
the compiler is a buggy mess and like
gives you tons of crappy errors. But if
gives you tons of crappy errors. But if
you had that but good like the ability
you had that but good like the ability
to quickly switch between something for
to quickly switch between something for
like you don't want to do stream
like you don't want to do stream
processing of C for instance like just
processing of C for instance like just
like basic. It's a pain in the ass,
like basic. It's a pain in the ass,
right? You don't care if it's fast, you
right? You don't care if it's fast, you
just want it to work. You want it to not
just want it to work. You want it to not
be a bunch of lines. um easily switching
be a bunch of lines. um easily switching
between these two things would be
between these two things would be
way way better, but it just doesn't work
way way better, but it just doesn't work
at the moment. Like we have to go
at the moment. Like we have to go
through the Python C API, which is a
through the Python C API, which is a
bloated buggy mess.
bloated buggy mess.
Every time you add something from the
Every time you add something from the
outside, it's usually a buggy bloated

buggy mess. Like dependencies are really
bad unless you can actually read all the

dependencies and change them yourself.
dependencies and change them yourself.
Yeah, it's I mean it's tough. It's like
Yeah, it's I mean it's tough. It's like
at some point it's like I don't want to
at some point it's like I don't want to
write my own graphics engine, right? I
write my own graphics engine, right? I
want a lightweight one. Okay, Ray Ray is
want a lightweight one. Okay, Ray Ray is
perfect. It already exists.
perfect. It already exists.
I mean, the thing about Rayb and I think
I mean, the thing about Rayb and I think
there's also soal and all these like
there's also soal and all these like
graphics libraries is that they're super
graphics libraries is that they're super
lightweight. Like you can actually just
lightweight. Like you can actually just
go read the header files like
go read the header files like
Yeah, that to me is less of a dependency
Yeah, that to me is less of a dependency
than just having someone's code as

Just fix for loops in Python. Yes,
Just fix for loops in Python. Yes,
there's not really a way to fix for
there's not really a way to fix for
loops in Python. Like,
do you see every do you see? If you go
do you see every do you see? If you go
look at the Python C API, you'll see how
look at the Python C API, you'll see how
much happens every time you do any
much happens every time you do any
operation in Python at all.
operation in Python at all.
It's just always going to be slow.
Like literally every single thing every
Like literally every single thing every
variable no matter what it is gets
variable no matter what it is gets
wrapped in like a big pi object where
wrapped in like a big pi object where
like everything is abstracted so that
like everything is abstracted so that
everything can be type independent. So
everything can be type independent. So
you have you know your dynamically it's
you have you know your dynamically it's
just a mess.
And oh and then one of my big pet peeves
And oh and then one of my big pet peeves
is like people try to like reintroduce
is like people try to like reintroduce
types into Python. Freaking hate type
types into Python. Freaking hate type
Python typins.
Python typins.
That drives me nuts.
That drives me nuts.
That just doesn't work. People keep
That just doesn't work. People keep
trying to PR like types into puffer lab

If you want
If you want
I feel similarly about like I feel
I feel similarly about like I feel
similarly about TypeScript and
similarly about TypeScript and
JavaScript. Just use JavaScript.
JavaScript. Just use JavaScript.
Yeah. I don't like TypeScript at all.
Yeah. I don't like TypeScript at all.
Think about like how how sick how sick
Think about like how how sick how sick
in the head would you have to be to come
in the head would you have to be to come
up with an idea like TypeScript? We're
up with an idea like TypeScript? We're
going to have a language that compiles
going to have a language that compiles
to JavaScript. Yes. Which is a like
to JavaScript. Yes. Which is a like
what is

Yeah. Uh the people who suggest this to
Yeah. Uh the people who suggest this to
me as well. It's like there are certain
me as well. It's like there are certain
people I know who have built impressive
people I know who have built impressive
things but just have a very very high
things but just have a very very high
density of just horrendous engineering
density of just horrendous engineering
takes. So it's like yeah you built the
takes. So it's like yeah you built the
thing it took you five times as long and
thing it took you five times as long and
the code was 10 times as complex. You
the code was 10 times as complex. You
did build the thing. So, you know,

I think the difference between people
I think the difference between people
who end up doing that and people who
who end up doing that and people who
really avoid doing that is people who
really avoid doing that is people who
are really trying to get things done as
are really trying to get things done as

The so the reason here is we do
The so the reason here is we do
algorithm research. Right.
algorithm research. Right.
Right. Okay.
Right. Okay.
So when we're doing algorithm research
So when we're doing algorithm research
like we need to be able to run stuff on

tons of different environments.
tons of different environments.
Right.
Right.
Because like there's hold the algorithm

Yeah.
Yeah.
Right. So like being able to quickly and
Right. So like being able to quickly and
simply test the current thing, whatever
simply test the current thing, whatever
state it is in on a ton of different

Yeah. Like keeping it modular like that.
Yeah. Like keeping it modular like that.
Yeah. So I don't like it. I don't like
Yeah. So I don't like it. I don't like
it either. Um we've tried like just pure
it either. Um we've tried like just pure
dictionaries before. The any files have
dictionaries before. The any files have
just been better for us.
just been better for us.
Okay.
Okay.
There's also like
we have it such that there's like a
we have it such that there's like a
default file and then anything you put
default file and then anything you put
in the ins just goes on top of the
in the ins just goes on top of the
defaults as well. So it's like most of
defaults as well. So it's like most of
the time you just need a stub.
the time you just need a stub.
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe it'll maybe we
Yeah. I don't know. Maybe it'll maybe we

Yeah.
Yeah.
We're going to do that. It'll be fine

go find what is the minimal batch

I end up with like a tenth of the code

other stuff I'm currently doing so I
other stuff I'm currently doing so I
have more time to do outgo stuff. But uh
have more time to do outgo stuff. But uh
yeah, I like I'm realistically in order
yeah, I like I'm realistically in order
to make RLB where it needs to be, I'm
to make RLB where it needs to be, I'm
gonna have to do a whole bunch of
gonna have to do a whole bunch of
algorithm side work. But like for Puffer
algorithm side work. But like for Puffer
to be where Puffer needs to be, I need
to be where Puffer needs to be, I need
to kind of make some solid applications
to kind of make some solid applications
of this first.
of this first.
So that's what I'm doing at the moment.
So that's what I'm doing at the moment.
Yeah, very say like we are going to get
Yeah, very say like we are going to get
some research benefits out of all these
some research benefits out of all these

the thing that we're not going to get is
the thing that we're not going to get is
like the core

What's the other stuff? If you look at
What's the other stuff? If you look at
um the guide that I posted today, the RL
um the guide that I posted today, the RL

sample efficiency is a big question
sample efficiency is a big question
right now and it's probably the most

essentially there are minimum of three

I haven't even thought of in there
it's a whole mess
If I had to guess, I think it's like
If I had to guess, I think it's like
it might even end up being problem
it might even end up being problem

But we I think even with the stuff we

have now, we can solve like we can solve

really like important problems in a ton
really like important problems in a ton
of areas with what we have right now.
Are these algorithms that currently

exist or new new ones to be discovered?
So, what it probably is, frankly, it's
So, what it probably is, frankly, it's
going to look like me going through the
going to look like me going through the
last seven years worth of deep mind
last seven years worth of deep mind
research. Uh, ripping out all the fancy
research. Uh, ripping out all the fancy
bits that make the algorithms seem cool
bits that make the algorithms seem cool
and keeping the bits that actually make
and keeping the bits that actually make
the algorithms work and then running
the algorithms work and then running
tens of thousands of experiments to test

all that. That's basically what I did on
all that. That's basically what I did on
PO for uh the 3 release that made it

Is there a summary of different complex

Complex topics, the three that I just
Complex topics, the three that I just
mentioned with references are in the

count and training time. That's all
count and training time. That's all
that's like almost completely unexplored
that's like almost completely unexplored
in RL. Uh we just don't use deep models
in RL. Uh we just don't use deep models
almost ever because they don't work and
almost ever because they don't work and
we don't really know why in general.
To be fair, we also know that we don't
To be fair, we also know that we don't
actually need deep models to solve
actually need deep models to solve
ludicrously complex problems in
ludicrously complex problems in
reinforcement learning. And I think
reinforcement learning. And I think
that's also unclear, right? Like shallow
that's also unclear, right? Like shallow
models kind of don't work in other areas
models kind of don't work in other areas
like to solve perception tasks for

ridiculously hard problems in RL.
Wait, did Yaxine post like 10 times
Wait, did Yaxine post like 10 times
while we were having that conversation?
I think he did.
Oh, no. Okay, he's been That's all since
Oh, no. Okay, he's been That's all since

That's funny.
Cool. We don't use deep models because

independent of the architecture used.
That's the technical explanation of

that.
Uh, I think he wants feedback on that
Uh, I think he wants feedback on that
PR, but we're going to do drum stuff.
Finn, Sam, are you still here?
Uh, yeah, I'm still around. I think Sam
Uh, yeah, I'm still around. I think Sam
will be, I don't know, maybe 45 minutes
will be, I don't know, maybe 45 minutes
and he'll be back.
and he'll be back.
Yeah, I know. we sort of got
Yeah, I know. we sort of got
sidetracked, but uh
sidetracked, but uh
that was a cool conversation and I think
that was a cool conversation and I think
a lot of people will get interested in
a lot of people will get interested in
uh some of the stuff we're working on
uh some of the stuff we're working on
from that. So, hey, maybe we'll even
from that. So, hey, maybe we'll even
have more people helping out with this
have more people helping out with this
stuff.
stuff.
Yeah,
Yeah,
I guess one of the things I should say
I guess one of the things I should say
in case we have new people here is if
in case we have new people here is if
you have experience in another field, uh
you have experience in another field, uh
that's also really helpful with RL
that's also really helpful with RL
because we're looking for all sorts of
because we're looking for all sorts of
problems in different fields uh where
problems in different fields uh where
people just kind of haven't thought of
people just kind of haven't thought of
building sims and trying RL. We built
building sims and trying RL. We built
lots of sims.
lots of sims.
Okay. So, the thing that I was going to
Okay. So, the thing that I was going to
tell you guys on the drone stuff is
tell you guys on the drone stuff is
if we just make every problem some form
if we just make every problem some form
of go to target, that should at the very
of go to target, that should at the very
least cover the rings, like the ring
least cover the rings, like the ring
task and the um all like the flag tasks
task and the um all like the flag tasks
and other things. So, what do you guys
and other things. So, what do you guys
think if I make one big sim with that
think if I make one big sim with that
where I try to keep the complexity as
where I try to keep the complexity as
low as possible? I have like the drone
low as possible? I have like the drone
stuff independent and it basically you
stuff independent and it basically you
can just load in different tasks, right?
can just load in different tasks, right?
So like you have an end that can put
So like you have an end that can put
rings, it can put targets or whatever
rings, it can put targets or whatever
and we just try to do that.
and we just try to do that.
Yeah, that sounds good. It'd be it'd be
Yeah, that sounds good. It'd be it'd be
a lot better than having 10 environments
a lot better than having 10 environments
with marginally different tasks. That
with marginally different tasks. That
wouldn't be great.
wouldn't be great.
Environments. Yeah.
Environments. Yeah.
Well, I don't always know, right?
Well, I don't always know, right?
Sometimes it is better to just have
Sometimes it is better to just have
separate stuff, but I'm thinking like do
separate stuff, but I'm thinking like do
we just get better
we just get better
better results out of um
better results out of um
training on more different stuff or
training on more different stuff or
should we like only train on racising?
should we like only train on racising?
I see. Uh
I see. Uh
yeah, I don't know. That could be cool.
yeah, I don't know. That could be cool.
It's usually the case that like when you
It's usually the case that like when you
have a few different tasks, it is
have a few different tasks, it is
initially harder than one task. Um, but
initially harder than one task. Um, but
then when you get like more and more
then when you get like more and more
training diversity, it actually makes it
training diversity, it actually makes it
easier. So the best number of tasks to
easier. So the best number of tasks to
train on is either one or as many as
train on is either one or as many as
possible,
possible,
right?
right?
If that makes sense.
If that makes sense.
That's usually how our like curriculum
That's usually how our like curriculum
learning RL works,
right? It's kind of like, you know, if
right? It's kind of like, you know, if
you just try to like learn to enough of
you just try to like learn to enough of
a field to solve one problem, for
a field to solve one problem, for
instance, that's generally pretty
instance, that's generally pretty
doable. Uh or if you try to like if you
doable. Uh or if you try to like if you
want to solve like five problems, then
want to solve like five problems, then
you're better off. You just got to learn
you're better off. You just got to learn
the field, right? It's it's one of
the field, right? It's it's one of
those.
those.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
In terms of the the sim to real stuff.
In terms of the the sim to real stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um me and Sam are we're a little bit
Um me and Sam are we're a little bit
busy for sort of like the next two
busy for sort of like the next two
weeks, but then after that we've got
weeks, but then after that we've got
like an entire month of just nothing. So
like an entire month of just nothing. So
most of the stuff will probably be done
most of the stuff will probably be done
in sort of late July, August.
in sort of late July, August.
Um, but there's there's a bunch of uh
Um, but there's there's a bunch of uh
physics stuff to be added until then.
physics stuff to be added until then.
Should still be busy.
Should still be busy.
Yeah. I mean, I'm going to try to get
Yeah. I mean, I'm going to try to get
like some really solid Sims and then
like some really solid Sims and then
it's just a question of how hard is it
it's just a question of how hard is it
to throw on the hardware. I mean, it's
to throw on the hardware. I mean, it's
it might be the case that we just throw
it might be the case that we just throw
the commands on the hardware and it
the commands on the hardware and it
works. Uh, I don't know. The perception
works. Uh, I don't know. The perception
stuff is going to be a little different.
stuff is going to be a little different.
Uh, I'm probably going to have to get
Uh, I'm probably going to have to get
myself a drone kit as well to help work
myself a drone kit as well to help work
on that because we do need to do state
on that because we do need to do state
estimation of some type, right?
estimation of some type, right?
Uh, there was a paper I read from Zurich
Uh, there was a paper I read from Zurich
where they just use the camera, but but
where they just use the camera, but but
yeah, state estimation probably not
yeah, state estimation probably not
hurt.
hurt.
Well, if you learn end to end with the
Well, if you learn end to end with the
camera again, your training gets a
camera again, your training gets a
thousandx slower.
thousandx slower.
Yeah. Yeah. Right.
Yeah. Yeah. Right.
So, that's just not fun ideally.
trying to think like what's the simplest
trying to think like what's the simplest
thing we could throw together to make uh
thing we could throw together to make uh
to make it work initially. It's probably
to make it work initially. It's probably
just like the hoops or whatever because
just like the hoops or whatever because
the hoops are almost like QR codes,
the hoops are almost like QR codes,
right? It's kind of like an offtheshelf
right? It's kind of like an offtheshelf
offtheshelf thing.
offtheshelf thing.
Mhm.
Mhm.
I don't know how you get like distance
I don't know how you get like distance
to those though from K like it does a
to those though from K like it does a
depth. It's like a depth estimation as
depth. It's like a depth estimation as
well, isn't it?
well, isn't it?
Yeah. Hello. I'm back.
Yeah. Hello. I'm back.
Where's
Where's
this
this
with the drone stuff? Like
with the drone stuff? Like
I think so I can get us one sim that
I think so I can get us one sim that
does this forming and does your stuff
does this forming and does your stuff
and it'll be really easy to load
and it'll be really easy to load
specific tasks in or to train all the
specific tasks in or to train all the
different tasks. like I can get a full
different tasks. like I can get a full
demos out of that for sure. Now the
demos out of that for sure. Now the
question is going to be to get it on the
question is going to be to get it on the
real hardware right there two things
real hardware right there two things
right there to real gap and then there's
right there to real gap and then there's
the perception part to actually estimate
the perception part to actually estimate
state.
state.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I I think the the latter would probably
I I think the the latter would probably
be the more difficult part but I'm not
be the more difficult part but I'm not
sure
sure
the state estimation.
the state estimation.
Uh yeah.
Uh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
I mean,
what's like the most basic thing we can
what's like the most basic thing we can
do for that?
I mean,
I mean,
just
a drone kit you're using. Is it possible
a drone kit you're using. Is it possible
to 3D print drones?
to 3D print drones?
Order a bunch of batteries? You need
Order a bunch of batteries? You need
motors and cameras and sensors and like
motors and cameras and sensors and like
you need chips. The only thing you can
you need chips. The only thing you can
print is a frame.
print is a frame.
A frame isn't even expensive. Like at
A frame isn't even expensive. Like at
that point, you're just you're just
that point, you're just you're just
causing yourself a whole bunch of
causing yourself a whole bunch of
assembly work or uh not saving really
assembly work or uh not saving really
any money or anything. The only reason
any money or anything. The only reason
we would like 3D print stuff is if we
we would like 3D print stuff is if we
wanted to play with different form
wanted to play with different form
factors or something.
factors or something.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Basic estimation.
There was there was that paper you sent
There was there was that paper you sent
me this morning as well, Finn. The It
me this morning as well, Finn. The It
was from Zurich again. What was that?
was from Zurich again. What was that?
Uh what? The champion level drone racing
Uh what? The champion level drone racing

No, the the first one. The
No, the the first one. The
Oh, yeah. The perception only one.
Oh, yeah. The perception only one.
Yeah, that seemed pretty cool.
Yeah, that seemed pretty cool.
I mean, if we could
I mean, if we could
It's so hard. Like getting that sim to
It's so hard. Like getting that sim to
real is way harder, I would think,
real is way harder, I would think,
is the annoying bit because like
is the annoying bit because like
when they do that in robotics,
when they do that in robotics,
right, they like
right, they like
They have a pretty clean deployment
They have a pretty clean deployment
setup for it. There's not really a bunch
setup for it. There's not really a bunch
of visual noise
of visual noise
getting a sim to real when like you have
getting a sim to real when like you have
a realistic moving background and such.
a realistic moving background and such.
That's
That's
Yeah,
Yeah,
I think that's going to be pretty
I think that's going to be pretty
obnoxious.
obnoxious.
It's not even either.
It's not even either.
Ideally, you just segment the the image,
Ideally, you just segment the the image,
right? And then it's kind of doesn't
right? And then it's kind of doesn't
really matter what the background is.
I mean, you can do that.
I mean, you can do that.
You really want to just know where
You really want to just know where
you want to know where the target is.
you want to know where the target is.
Like then at that point, you're not
Like then at that point, you're not
really doing you're not doing state
really doing you're not doing state
estimation at all. You're doing end to
estimation at all. You're doing end to
end.
end.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The only way we could do that, right,
The only way we could do that, right,
it's it makes the project much more
it's it makes the project much more
complicated. It's thing I was telling a
complicated. It's thing I was telling a
which is the batch renderer.
which is the batch renderer.
It makes it a lot more complicated.
It makes it a lot more complicated.
I think my preference here would be
I think my preference here would be
is there like a really basic state
is there like a really basic state
estimation thing that we can do to get
estimation thing that we can do to get
something to work first?
something to work first?
Uh yes is uh let me see what
Uh yes is uh let me see what
I mean isn't best case scenario
I mean isn't best case scenario
it the kind of
it the kind of
sim to real gap is so small that it
sim to real gap is so small that it
doesn't really matter but I think that's
doesn't really matter but I think that's
kind of
kind of
it's not the sim to real gap issue right
it's not the sim to real gap issue right
it's the state estimation problem
it's the state estimation problem
so you need to know where the targets
so you need to know where the targets
are right we're training on like the
are right we're training on like the
target
target
you need to know where the target is if
you need to know where the target is if
you instrument the targets. It's easy,
you instrument the targets. It's easy,
but that's cheating. Now, you can
but that's cheating. Now, you can
actually when we doing
actually when we doing
I was thinking of something else.
I was thinking of something else.
We actually like the flag demo for stuff
We actually like the flag demo for stuff
for instance, like that stuff, we can
for instance, like that stuff, we can
actually just cheat because
actually just cheat because
all we really need to know is where all
all we really need to know is where all
the drones are
the drones are
and they're allowed to talk to each
and they're allowed to talk to each
other, right? That's not cheating.
other, right? That's not cheating.
They're all your drones.
They're all your drones.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, the the kind of
Well, the the kind of
I suppose easy but very expensive way
I suppose easy but very expensive way
they they did it before. Did they did
they they did it before. Did they did
they not just have like 50 cameras in

Yeah, one of their papers did, which is
Yeah, one of their papers did, which is
kind of kind of crazy.
kind of kind of crazy.
Just had like a massive warehouse filled
Just had like a massive warehouse filled
with cameras and the hoops and stuff and
with cameras and the hoops and stuff and
it could just track them.
it could just track them.
Yeah, that's super cheaty though. like
Yeah, that's super cheaty though. like
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's not going to work anywhere else.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. It's kind of a bit silly really.
Yeah. It's kind of a bit silly really.
I think accelerometer is probably the
I think accelerometer is probably the
way to go.

I think 65 crypto.
I mean, at that point, you just like
I mean, at that point, you just like
record the positions of,
record the positions of,
you know, all the targets and just give
you know, all the targets and just give
it to the drone, right? Like there's no
it to the drone, right? Like there's no
reason to even have any perception.
Yeah,
Yeah,
we could. Well, you don't know your
we could. Well, you don't know your
absolute position is the annoying bit,
absolute position is the annoying bit,
right?
right?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You can like
You can like
you have to integrate from your starting
you have to integrate from your starting
position. And I'm pretty sure that type
position. And I'm pretty sure that type
of stuff is like really noisy, right?
of stuff is like really noisy, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you just like double integral your
If you just like double integral your
acceleration, it's really noisy.
That that's what you were trying for
That that's what you were trying for
our like original drone before we had
our like original drone before we had
the the new one and it just didn't work
the the new one and it just didn't work
at all.
at all.
Drone communication might be cheating if
Drone communication might be cheating if
you consider somebody might be trying to
you consider somebody might be trying to
interrupt the signal.
interrupt the signal.
Um I don't know like
Um I don't know like
How many things are there? I guess
How many things are there? I guess
technically they can jam the radar
technically they can jam the radar
without like impeding the drone
without like impeding the drone
if you want to think of it that way. So
if you want to think of it that way. So
you can interrupt communication and
you can interrupt communication and
still leave it online. I guess
still leave it online. I guess
technically
state the state estimation thing is
state the state estimation thing is
is tough.
I really don't want to do the the batch
I really don't want to do the the batch
render thing just on our own, you know?
render thing just on our own, you know?
Like I don't want to just like do the
Like I don't want to just like do the
batch render to make a cool demo work,
batch render to make a cool demo work,
right? Like the batch render thing is if
right? Like the batch render thing is if
we want to do perception based stuff
we want to do perception based stuff
that will be part of a larger project in
that will be part of a larger project in
my mind.
my mind.
Okay,
Okay,
depth camera. Yeah, we can get like a
depth camera. Yeah, we can get like a
depth sensor I guess. But I don't know
depth sensor I guess. But I don't know
how well that works cuz like okay, you
how well that works cuz like okay, you
have a camera and let's say you're
have a camera and let's say you're
basically doing QR code stuff that's off
basically doing QR code stuff that's off
the shelf, right? because it's
the shelf, right? because it's
the targets.
the targets.
They are painted with something so you
They are painted with something so you
can recognize them. That's pretty
can recognize them. That's pretty
standard,
you know. Um, ages ago, Finn, that like
you know. Um, ages ago, Finn, that like
depth perception thing that Armon had
depth perception thing that Armon had
running on his laptop.
running on his laptop.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
How many frames per second was that?
How many frames per second was that?
Uh, not enough.
Uh, not enough.
Not enough. Okay.
Not enough. Okay.
I think it I mean on our computers,
I think it I mean on our computers,
which is not ideal, obviously. It was
which is not ideal, obviously. It was
like what? Maybe 3 FPS.
like what? Maybe 3 FPS.
Okay.
Okay.
There are there are faster ones, but
There are there are faster ones, but
Oh, you mean like the camera based
Oh, you mean like the camera based
stuff? Yeah, that stuff doesn't work.
stuff? Yeah, that stuff doesn't work.
Yeah, I've worked on that before. That's
Yeah, I've worked on that before. That's
that's way too slow.
that's way too slow.
I mean, tech like I maybe if you really
I mean, tech like I maybe if you really
tried you could like get a version of it
tried you could like get a version of it
inference only. You're not going to
inference only. You're not going to
train on anything coming out of that
train on anything coming out of that
though.
though.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
I think um I sent
I think um I sent
Sorry, go on.
Sorry, go on.
I was just going to say I'll put a
I was just going to say I'll put a
there's a there's a kind of a cool
there's a there's a kind of a cool
graphic from one of the Zurich papers
graphic from one of the Zurich papers
that I've just put in dev.
that I've just put in dev.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Actually send about how they do their
Actually send about how they do their
state estimation.
Is it like super complicated?
Is it like super complicated?
Yeah. I mean it's complicated enough but
Yeah. I mean it's complicated enough but
it would be
it would be
great bit of a pain.
great bit of a pain.
I'm saying image.
I'm saying image.
It's probably
It's probably
I mean we've kind of got to get it
I mean we've kind of got to get it
working on like
working on like
is it strings before we
is it strings before we
Yeah, that is because it's trained
Yeah, that is because it's trained
right. It's like they're they're kind of
right. It's like they're they're kind of
just putting this calman filter. Yeah.
just putting this calman filter. Yeah.
So they're training on
So they're training on
essentially down sampled images. This is
essentially down sampled images. This is
basically the same thing as what if we
basically the same thing as what if we
just train on images with some
just train on images with some
pre-processing. So that's super slow.
pre-processing. So that's super slow.
That's not That's not exactly state
That's not That's not exactly state
estimation,
right?
right?
Yeah.
Is there if we instrument the things, is
Is there if we instrument the things, is
there like a uh
there like a uh
how hard is it to get a like a a
how hard is it to get a like a a
proximity sensor that gives you a
proximity sensor that gives you a
reliable estimate of how far you are
reliable estimate of how far you are
away from another sensor?
away from another sensor?
How was it done?
How was it done?
I I don't think it's exactly the same
I I don't think it's exactly the same
thing, but um they used a
thing, but um they used a
uh it was on the the drone websites when
uh it was on the the drone websites when
we were buying the parts. It's called
we were buying the parts. It's called
the Intel Real Sense camera. Uh, and
the Intel Real Sense camera. Uh, and
then they just like had that connected
then they just like had that connected
to some onboard
to some onboard
compute thing.
compute thing.
Uh, I I think it's basically just a kind
Uh, I I think it's basically just a kind
of an infrared based
of an infrared based
um depth sensor pretty much.
infrared base depth sensor.
Well, you need to also know that you're
Well, you need to also know that you're
looking at the targets.
looking at the targets.
Yeah,
but I I got the gist that going down the
but I I got the gist that going down the
the route of these Intel cameras means
the route of these Intel cameras means
you'd need to buy one of those kind of
you'd need to buy one of those kind of
Nvidia compute modules as well. And it's
Nvidia compute modules as well. And it's
just a a very expensive rabbit hole.
just a a very expensive rabbit hole.
You know, initially guys, we could just
You know, initially guys, we could just
punt on it for now and just be like,
punt on it for now and just be like,
"Hey, let's get the thing to run on the
"Hey, let's get the thing to run on the
real drone." Um, we have relative
real drone." Um, we have relative
we have relative targeting, right?
we have relative targeting, right?
So, what we could do
So, what we could do
is we could just make a thing, right,
is we could just make a thing, right,
where on your laptop, you can drag
where on your laptop, you can drag
around the target or whatever
around the target or whatever
and it'll just go to that
and it'll just go to that
because you basically you tell it, "All
because you basically you tell it, "All
right, the target's this far away."
right, the target's this far away."
Um,
Um,
you just do the basic integral or
you just do the basic integral or
whatever. It doesn't collapse because it
whatever. It doesn't collapse because it
gets reset every target.
gets reset every target.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So then like that should basically let
So then like that should basically let
you control the drone and it should be
you control the drone and it should be
able to go from like its current
able to go from like its current
position to any other position pretty
position to any other position pretty
easily. And like we can already start
easily. And like we can already start
throwing together some demos before we
throwing together some demos before we
have to do perception. Like my highest
have to do perception. Like my highest
priority here is to just get get the
priority here is to just get get the
neural net running on the drone in a way
neural net running on the drone in a way
that it's actually flying correctly,
that it's actually flying correctly,
right? Like the perception thing is kind
right? Like the perception thing is kind
of whatever. Like in my mind, this is
of whatever. Like in my mind, this is
this is like all the application
this is like all the application
specific crap, right? Like I think that
specific crap, right? Like I think that
even before we touch perception, we
even before we touch perception, we
should be able to come up with something
should be able to come up with something
cool enough
Like yeah, like what if we just give it
Like yeah, like what if we just give it
the
the
if we just like give it the course for
if we just like give it the course for
instance, right? Like literally just run
instance, right? Like literally just run
the exact policy. It's going to do all
the exact policy. It's going to do all
sorts of cool aerial maneuvers, isn't
sorts of cool aerial maneuvers, isn't
it?
it?
Mhm. You'd hope so. Yeah, that would be
Mhm. You'd hope so. Yeah, that would be
I'm pretty sure for these drone racing
I'm pretty sure for these drone racing
things, their their policy is literally
things, their their policy is literally
just on that one course anyway. So at
just on that one course anyway. So at
least then we know that we're at least
least then we know that we're at least
as good as
as good as
as the current best is
as the current best is
well depending on how what the gap is
well depending on how what the gap is
like what you could do is you could just
like what you could do is you could just
like set it up and measure right like
like set it up and measure right like
put a couple of hoops around no
put a couple of hoops around no
instrumentation no perception and like
instrumentation no perception and like
if the thing is accurate it'll just fly
if the thing is accurate it'll just fly
through them if they're in the same
through them if they're in the same
position as it thinks. I'm sure that the
position as it thinks. I'm sure that the
like it'll diverge eventually, but
like it'll diverge eventually, but
my priority here is I don't want to make
my priority here is I don't want to make
you guys do a bunch of boring ass
you guys do a bunch of boring ass
annoying perception work. Like the goal
annoying perception work. Like the goal
is to get something cool running on the
is to get something cool running on the
bot as quickly as possible. I think
bot as quickly as possible. I think
that'll be way more interesting for you
that'll be way more interesting for you
and that'll already make like a really
and that'll already make like a really
cool demo because you'll get like just
cool demo because you'll get like just
flying the horse in midair will get you
flying the horse in midair will get you
all sorts of like interesting aerial
all sorts of like interesting aerial
maneuvers, right?
maneuvers, right?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I think that that
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I think that that
should be really cool. And then once we
should be really cool. And then once we
once we've got some cool stuff, then we
once we've got some cool stuff, then we
could we'll know if we need well what to
could we'll know if we need well what to
what level we need perception.
what level we need perception.
I almost wonder well this probably be a
I almost wonder well this probably be a
pain in the ass if you can just like
pain in the ass if you can just like
throw some AR goggles on and like see
throw some AR goggles on and like see
the course like have it like run an AR
the course like have it like run an AR
course so we don't have to actually
course so we don't have to actually
Right.
Right.
Yeah,
Yeah,
that would be kind of cool.
Well, we've we've kind of got a a good
Well, we've we've kind of got a a good
controlled environment to do the the
controlled environment to do the the
drone in because we've um like booked
drone in because we've um like booked
out the exam hall basically which is
out the exam hall basically which is
like 500 person capacity. So, we've got
like 500 person capacity. So, we've got
a massive hall to fly around in at
a massive hall to fly around in at
speed.
speed.
So, we can probably
So, we can probably
probably even like stream some of it
probably even like stream some of it
from from our phone or something just so
from from our phone or something just so
that be awesome. You guys can see
infrared probably won't work due to
infrared probably won't work due to
distance constraints. Maybe more LAR.
distance constraints. Maybe more LAR.
Yeah, we don't want to really get into
Yeah, we don't want to really get into
that crap before we can avoid it, right?
that crap before we can avoid it, right?
Like
Like
that sounds cheap.
that sounds cheap.
The goal of um
The goal of um
the goal of a lot of what we're doing is
the goal of a lot of what we're doing is
to really showcase the tech and then
to really showcase the tech and then
like application specific tie-ins to
like application specific tie-ins to
tech. We can do that as part of like
tech. We can do that as part of like
formal engagements with companies and
formal engagements with companies and
clients and stuff, right? We want to the
clients and stuff, right? We want to the
core stuff that we do on our own is
core stuff that we do on our own is
mainly like keep it as we want to like
mainly like keep it as we want to like
show off as many cool things as we can
show off as many cool things as we can
that are like close to the tech. And I
that are like close to the tech. And I
think this is this qualifies because
think this is this qualifies because
this will be simil
this will be simil
this this is sim real like flying the
this this is sim real like flying the
course in the air. Um
course in the air. Um
the perception is a completely
the perception is a completely
independent problem, right?
independent problem, right?
It's a problem we know how to solve if
It's a problem we know how to solve if
we had to, right? There are two
we had to, right? There are two
different approaches. There's state
different approaches. There's state
estimation. It's literally been done
estimation. It's literally been done
already, right? It's just annoying.
already, right? It's just annoying.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh and then there is like hyper batch
Uh and then there is like hyper batch
simulation, right? It's hyper hyperfast
simulation, right? It's hyper hyperfast
sim for uh camera. That's like another
sim for uh camera. That's like another
thing you can do.
Yeah.
It shouldn't even be that crazy
It shouldn't even be that crazy
expensive I would think for something
expensive I would think for something
like this.
like this.
Like Madrona, you probably with Madrona
Like Madrona, you probably with Madrona
you could get a couple hundred thousand
you could get a couple hundred thousand
frames per second in order to scale
frames per second in order to scale
GPUs, but like we literally don't need
GPUs, but like we literally don't need
to do that initially at all. It's just
to do that initially at all. It's just
like get the drones running around doing
like get the drones running around doing
all sorts of crazy stuff autonomously.
all sorts of crazy stuff autonomously.
Could
Could
you find a USB A to A cable Finn or
you find a USB A to A cable Finn or
shall I uh
shall I uh
get one ready to
get one ready to
I mean I can look in like 10 minutes
I mean I can look in like 10 minutes
sure.
sure.
Okay.
Okay.
I think I've got one.
I think I've got one.
I think that's the the last thing we'll
I think that's the the last thing we'll
need.
need.
Oh. Um are we we still don't really need
Oh. Um are we we still don't really need
to get video back from the the drone's
to get video back from the the drone's
camera yet, do we? cuz that was the kind
camera yet, do we? cuz that was the kind
of the component we skipped out last
of the component we skipped out last
time because there was no no stuff I
time because there was no no stuff I
think when I looked the other day at the
think when I looked the other day at the
moment.
moment.
Yeah,
Yeah,
I think if you guys can just get and
I think if you guys can just get and
this way it's not going to take months
this way it's not going to take months
as well. I think if you guys can just
as well. I think if you guys can just
like can we run the code on the drone?
like can we run the code on the drone?
Can we get it to fly around and do like
Can we get it to fly around and do like
what looks like running the course? Just
what looks like running the course? Just
like watch on your basically just if you
like watch on your basically just if you
can see on your laptop like this is what
can see on your laptop like this is what
it thinks in the sim, right? Right. And
it thinks in the sim, right? Right. And
then you can like physically look at
then you can like physically look at
what the drone is doing and see that
what the drone is doing and see that
they're it like looks like they're doing
they're it like looks like they're doing
the same stuff, right?
the same stuff, right?
Yeah. Yeah, that would be really cool.
Yeah. Yeah, that would be really cool.
You can quantify.
You can quantify.
I'm hoping we can
I'm hoping we can
we can well hopefully we can get the the
we can well hopefully we can get the the
model running on the drone like kind of
model running on the drone like kind of
same day. I'm hoping kind of the actual
same day. I'm hoping kind of the actual
hardware part of it shouldn't be too
hardware part of it shouldn't be too
bad. Um, and all of this drone firmware
bad. Um, and all of this drone firmware
plays nicely, but we'll see.
plays nicely, but we'll see.
Yeah, askine about the there's like the
Yeah, askine about the there's like the
general software that's used for a lot
general software that's used for a lot
of things. He's played with that before,
of things. He's played with that before,
I think, from different on different
I think, from different on different
problems.
problems.
We may have to mess around with what the
We may have to mess around with what the
actions look like.
actions look like.
I don't know how nicely the drone will
I don't know how nicely the drone will
play with just giving it RPM commands,
play with just giving it RPM commands,
but
but
what do you usually give it? It sounded
what do you usually give it? It sounded
like you can do that, but
like you can do that, but
yeah,
yeah,
it's a bit
it's a bit
slightly less standard.
slightly less standard.
Yeah.
But either way, it should be fine.
But either way, it should be fine.
Yeah. I'm just That's the thing I'm kind
Yeah. I'm just That's the thing I'm kind
of slightly worried about because when
of slightly worried about because when
we were doing it
we were doing it
uh with the old drone, simply just
uh with the old drone, simply just
sending commands to the drone
sending commands to the drone
programmatically was pretty difficult.
programmatically was pretty difficult.
just
just
Yeah. So, the hope is that it's not with
Yeah. So, the hope is that it's not with
this. And if it is, we'll have to do
this. And if it is, we'll have to do
something else.
At least the hope is that this one at
At least the hope is that this one at
least the hope with this one is that
least the hope with this one is that
it's not going to break in five minutes
it's not going to break in five minutes
at least.
at least.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like because the the ones they use for
Like because the the ones they use for
racing, they have unshielded
racing, they have unshielded
rotors.
rotors.
So,
So,
like you crash that thing at any speed
like you crash that thing at any speed
once, it's broken.
once, it's broken.
Well, the the the transmitter we got
Well, the the the transmitter we got
this time is kind of um you can just use
this time is kind of um you can just use
with any drone and it sounds like the
with any drone and it sounds like the
transmitter we've got is good and is
transmitter we've got is good and is
also pretty good for sending
also pretty good for sending
programmatic controls. So hopefully as
programmatic controls. So hopefully as
that's kind of the
that's kind of the
the key link this time, the actual drone
the key link this time, the actual drone
shouldn't really matter. It's an Johnny.
The guys are doing pretty well already.
We were looking at that earlier. the the
We were looking at that earlier. the the
list of the list of papers look good. I
list of the list of papers look good. I
need to I need to have a look through
need to I need to have a look through
that and see if there's anything I've
that and see if there's anything I've
missed out on.
missed out on.
What list of papers? Oh, the ones Yeah,
What list of papers? Oh, the ones Yeah,
that's like general
that's like general
there's general RL stuff in there. It's
there's general RL stuff in there. It's
really the best way to know uh
really the best way to know uh
to like learn this stuff. It's not it's
to like learn this stuff. It's not it's
not the uh the material that you'll find
not the uh the material that you'll find
pretty much anywhere else. Also,
pretty much anywhere else. Also,
it's like I have a very different
it's like I have a very different
approach to a lot of this stuff and it's
approach to a lot of this stuff and it's
it's honestly a lot easier like because
it's honestly a lot easier like because
if you have a really strong math
if you have a really strong math
background, like yeah, you'll just be
background, like yeah, you'll just be
fine doing all the formal stuff. But the
fine doing all the formal stuff. But the
thing is,
thing is,
it's not going to tell you how to
it's not going to tell you how to
actually do RL because none of the
actually do RL because none of the
format the formal math actually works.
format the formal math actually works.
And second of all, like if you don't
And second of all, like if you don't
have a really good math background, it's
have a really good math background, it's
going to be really hard and you're still
going to be really hard and you're still
not going to know how RL works. Whereas
not going to know how RL works. Whereas
if you just like are able to if you're
if you just like are able to if you're
able to do the material that I've sent,
able to do the material that I've sent,
like it relies more on programming.
like it relies more on programming.
It's more accessible in a sense because
It's more accessible in a sense because
maybe your code's not as good as mine,
maybe your code's not as good as mine,
but if you stick to the way that I've
but if you stick to the way that I've
suggested you do things, at least it'll
suggested you do things, at least it'll
be passively good. Um, and you'll
be passively good. Um, and you'll
actually get RL working. Like you will
actually get RL working. Like you will
provably have RL working on a new
provably have RL working on a new
problem, a new environment that you've

made, several new environments of

increasing complexity that you've made.
increasing complexity that you've made.
Um, and you fill in the theoretical gaps
Um, and you fill in the theoretical gaps
along the way. And the theoretical gaps
along the way. And the theoretical gaps
we're going to fill in aren't even the
we're going to fill in aren't even the
same as the ones in the the formal

interest readard for instance because
interest readard for instance because
it's like those are just really old and
it's like those are just really old and
bad models of a lot of problems.
bad models of a lot of problems.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's mostly knowledge of like you know
It's mostly knowledge of like you know
newer more empirical models and what
newer more empirical models and what
they're based on.
Okay, I'm going to get you guys a sim
Okay, I'm going to get you guys a sim
right now. That's going to be the goal.
right now. That's going to be the goal.
Uh I'm going to see if I basically just
Uh I'm going to see if I basically just
merge the drone swarm and the drone
merge the drone swarm and the drone
racing environments.
racing environments.
Yeah, I think that would be good. I kind
Yeah, I think that would be good. I kind
of I really like the way you've done it
of I really like the way you've done it
in
in
the the swarm one at the minute where
the the swarm one at the minute where
you just kind of just switch between
you just kind of just switch between
them. I think if we just go with that,
them. I think if we just go with that,
that would be great. It's a little
that would be great. It's a little
annoying because like the rings are
annoying because like the rings are
going to be task specific
going to be task specific
and I also was going to put like
and I also was going to put like
obstacles at some point. I think it
obstacles at some point. I think it
would be cool to put like obstacles know
would be cool to put like obstacles know
we could just spawn like random spheres
we could just spawn like random spheres
some distance away from uh
some distance away from uh
just in case it's useful. I'll put in my
just in case it's useful. I'll put in my
original like Python
original like Python
uh collisions code in the development
uh collisions code in the development
channel cuz that that supports planes
channel cuz that that supports planes
and um
and um
well planes are hard. Spheres are really
well planes are hard. Spheres are really
easy, right?
easy, right?
It's just a rad,
It's just a rad,
right?
right?
Yeah. I sat and worked out all of the
Yeah. I sat and worked out all of the
linear algebra for it and it does work.
linear algebra for it and it does work.
It's just not very
It's just not very
It's still quadratic. It's annoying on
It's still quadratic. It's annoying on
hard and it I'm not envious of that
hard and it I'm not envious of that
stuff.
Yeah, it took a while.
Yeah, it took a while.
You know, there's not really a great way
You know, there's not really a great way
to do planes. Cubes you can do very
to do planes. Cubes you can do very
easily. Cubes you just do a bounding
easily. Cubes you just do a bounding
sphere, right?
sphere, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's like pretty close.
the the original kind of plan back at
the the original kind of plan back at
end of last year probably with drone was
end of last year probably with drone was
getting it to kind of navigate
getting it to kind of navigate
um environments and stuff. Uh we've kind
um environments and stuff. Uh we've kind
of switched more over to
of switched more over to
kind of the the race. It was kind of
kind of the the race. It was kind of
more of like an exploring drone before I
more of like an exploring drone before I
suppose.
suppose.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um
Um
we can do that super easily in sim if
we can do that super easily in sim if
you guys want to.
you guys want to.
I mean, think about it. We just add a
I mean, think about it. We just add a
task. It's like get to the objective and
task. It's like get to the objective and
you're basically navigating through an
you're basically navigating through an
asteroid field, right?
asteroid field, right?
Mhm.
Mhm.
The only thing is like the um
The only thing is like the um
we have to change the ops a little bit
we have to change the ops a little bit
because it would be like you'd have to
because it would be like you'd have to
know
know
probably what we should do is there
probably what we should do is there
should just be like a ring buffer and
should just be like a ring buffer and
like a nearest buffer or something. So
like a nearest buffer or something. So
you can see the nearest rings because
you can see the nearest rings because
they have you need to actually know the
they have you need to actually know the
normal direction for those and that's
normal direction for those and that's
needed for racing. But everything else
needed for racing. But everything else
is just like an obstacle buffer. So like
is just like an obstacle buffer. So like
other drones are obstacles. Asteroids
other drones are obstacles. Asteroids
would be like obstacles.
would be like obstacles.
It's just like, "Hey, this is where it
It's just like, "Hey, this is where it
is. This is how big it is. Don't hit
is. This is how big it is. Don't hit
it."
it."
Yeah,
Yeah,
I can do I can get something like that
I can do I can get something like that
working. So then that would be like a
working. So then that would be like a
navigation type thing. Like, you know,
navigation type thing. Like, you know,
get to this bowl on the other side of
get to this bowl on the other side of
the map and don't crash into any of
the map and don't crash into any of
these obstacles.
these obstacles.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Cool.
Cool.
Yeah. I'm I'm looking back at the the
Yeah. I'm I'm looking back at the the
collision code now and there's some
collision code now and there's some
stuff which I'm not fully sure about now
stuff which I'm not fully sure about now
I look at it again because it is six
I look at it again because it is six
month old code but I think it it should
month old code but I think it it should
be all right.
be all right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, the other the other thing we did
Oh, the other the other thing we did
have originally which could be useful
have originally which could be useful
when when and if we do uh perception
when when and if we do uh perception
stuff is we we were able to uh train it
stuff is we we were able to uh train it
to look in a certain direction as well
to look in a certain direction as well
as moving to a a place so the camera is
as moving to a a place so the camera is
kind of facing in the right way.
kind of facing in the right way.
Yeah, that might be useful.
Yeah, that might be useful.
Um, so that I can actually that I'm not
Um, so that I can actually that I'm not
as concerned about because all I would
as concerned about because all I would
have to do for that is I would take the
have to do for that is I would take the
current state based observations and I
current state based observations and I
would make them only appear within a
would make them only appear within a
clone of vision. Right.
clone of vision. Right.
Right. Okay.
Right. Okay.
So, and then it's still the same state
So, and then it's still the same state
estimation problem
estimation problem
as before, right? Like you still have to
as before, right? Like you still have to
just do the state estimation, but then
just do the state estimation, but then
it should basically learn that it has to
it should basically learn that it has to
turn toward stuff to see it
turn toward stuff to see it
automatically.
automatically.
So that's not super hard. That's That's
So that's not super hard. That's That's
true.
true.
I think we we were going We were hoping
I think we we were going We were hoping
were we trying to get it to fly
were we trying to get it to fly
backwards or something? So, I can't
backwards or something? So, I can't
remember.
remember.
It has to spin and it like it takes a
It has to spin and it like it takes a
while to spin. So, it's like
while to spin. So, it's like
Yeah.
Yeah.
getting it to get new information like
getting it to get new information like

with Puffer Lib when he cuz like he was

trying to do some RL thing. He just hops

around and does a ton of different

Oh, nice.
Oh, nice.
So, I have I have grassroots marketing.
So, I have I have grassroots marketing.
We just have Puffer Lib. We just have
We just have Puffer Lib. We just have
we have some people that use puffer lip
we have some people that use puffer lip
and they like it apparently. So we're
and they like it apparently. So we're
very happy about that.
very happy about that.
Um puffer lip could be way better than
Um puffer lip could be way better than
it is now though. It can be way way

better. Going to do some applications on
better. Going to do some applications on
the current version before I really go
the current version before I really go
back and look at that.
Okay. So,
Okay. So,
I'm going to go use the bathroom and
I'm going to go use the bathroom and
grab coffee real quick and then I'm
grab coffee real quick and then I'm
going to see if I can actually code up
going to see if I can actually code up
the uh the single sim.
the uh the single sim.
I think I should be able to make a
I think I should be able to make a
decent dentonic today. Uh,
technically we could do
technically we could do
I'm going to see if we have like
I'm going to see if we have like
entirely different step functions per
entirely different step functions per
task or what cuz like technically
no I can't I can't actually make the
no I can't I can't actually make the
racing ends multi-agent because the
racing ends multi-agent because the
targets change when the drone goes
targets change when the drone goes
through them. It would be a cool thing
through them. It would be a cool thing
to have like a ton of drones flying the
to have like a ton of drones flying the
course. But
course. But
yeah,
yeah,
I mean, at least because it's PCGed for

now, like if you were to just write if
now, like if you were to just write if
you were to just put all the rings down
you were to just put all the rings down
at the same time, then you could do it.
at the same time, then you could do it.
Well, I mean, we could do that, right?
Well, I mean, we could do that, right?
There's
There's
they are all created at at the start.
they are all created at at the start.
It's like a set
It's like a set
set buffer. If we just put all the rings
set buffer. If we just put all the rings
down and then it just when it resets the
down and then it just when it resets the
whole environment resets the force. Like
whole environment resets the force. Like
I could put all the drones in and just
I could put all the drones in and just
like have them all do the same force at
like have them all do the same force at
the same time.
the same time.
Yeah, it does that already. It just only
Yeah, it does that already. It just only
shows you them one by one or two by two,
shows you them one by one or two by two,
I guess.
I guess.
Okay.
Okay.
Shouldn't be too bad.
Shouldn't be too bad.
You just have to keep track of which
You just have to keep track of which
ring each drone is at. We probably we
ring each drone is at. We probably we
might need to make the map a bit larger
might need to make the map a bit larger
as well cuz like the collision checks
as well cuz like the collision checks
for for everything.
for for everything.
It's 10 by 10.
It's 10 by 10.
I think we we've kind of
I think we we've kind of
Yeah.
Yeah.
We've just got kind of like a
uh the Zurich people.
uh the Zurich people.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um
Um
pretty big. I'm not sure exactly, but
pretty big. I'm not sure exactly, but
bigger than 10 by 10 by 10.
bigger than 10 by 10 by 10.
Yeah,
Yeah,
it's probably like is it like 50 by 50
it's probably like is it like 50 by 50
by 10 or something?
by 10 or something?
I'd imagine so. Yeah.
I'd imagine so. Yeah.
All right. Well, I'm going to see if I
All right. Well, I'm going to see if I
can make us something cool out of this.
can make us something cool out of this.
The other thing I was thinking about is
The other thing I was thinking about is
like if I wanted to put all the
like if I wanted to put all the
different environments like together so
different environments like together so
you can see some drones making a flag,
you can see some drones making a flag,
some drones doing racing and whatever.
some drones doing racing and whatever.
Um, collision gets obnoxious if I do

It's super obnoxious.

that then.
that then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mhm.
All right. I will try to just get
All right. I will try to just get
working on this. If you guys can get the
working on this. If you guys can get the
drone working, I will see if I can get
drone working, I will see if I can get
like a super stable super general
like a super stable super general
whatever drone whatever course demo
whatever drone whatever course demo
thing and like if the goal is like if we
thing and like if the goal is like if we
just get a really good policy that does
just get a really good policy that does
this then any perturbation of drone and
this then any perturbation of drone and
course should just be solvable

instantly. So you end up with like
instantly. So you end up with like
really robust self-correcting policies
really robust self-correcting policies
if you do this. That's the idea.
if you do this. That's the idea.
Mhm. We were working today a bit as well
Mhm. We were working today a bit as well
on improving the kind of like
on improving the kind of like
integration part. So using is it RK4 fin
integration part. So using is it RK4 fin
instead of oilers.

Yeah,
Yeah,
that would be Yes, that will be good.
that would be Yes, that will be good.
Please do not do forward oiler on uh
Please do not do forward oiler on uh
I actually do not know how stable RK4 is
I actually do not know how stable RK4 is
even going to be. Like you guys are
even going to be. Like you guys are
probably going to write want to write
probably going to write want to write
something to quantify that

like the measurements are going to be
like the measurements are going to be

It seems like the code for RK4 is going
It seems like the code for RK4 is going
to be pretty about five times anyway.
to be pretty about five times anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Isn't it Isn't it pretty short? I
Isn't it Isn't it pretty short? I
thought RK4 is pretty short.

I mean, I think it depends how you write

For like this is right here.
Is this not it?

I promised this many hours ago, but now

we will actually build some.
How bad could this possibly be? Right?
Have 400 lines of code here.
Maybe what I do is I keep the drone

These are already in the main file.
Few observations is fine.

It's fine.
It's fine.
This is actually pretty clean.
So, all we really need is the ring

So when we init this we have to allocate

to allocate the ring buffer.
And that's pretty much it.
ring has a position.
It's actually
why don't we just zero the whole thing,
why don't we just zero the whole thing,
right?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay. So, we zero out all the rings.
Now, the observations,
the observations are going to need to be
the observations are going to need to be
slightly different.
Yeah, we need to add in the rings.
Yeah, we need to add in the rings.
We can just do the next ring. Like the

Definitely want this.
Okay, so now we have our ring
and now let's get the plot to this ring.

I've been pretty lazy with my uh
I've been pretty lazy with my uh
streaming hours.
We don't need either of these facts,
We don't need either of these facts,
right?
Yeah. We just need these two.
Okay, so for drone swarm,
Okay, so for drone swarm,
we're going to add plus six before I
we're going to add plus six before I
forget to do this
forget to do this
because I added six observations.
It's cool.
I think this is good.
Now, when we do reset here,
we're going to pick a task. Okay.
And what we're going to do is
I wait these
and for now we'll just do it the simple
and for now we'll just do it the simple

and then this is going to have oops
All right,
you have set target.
If it's a race
then
then we need to do this generation
then we need to do this generation

we need to do this generation stuff.
Let's see if we clean this up a little

whatever we do this for now

So some of the educational material now

is out there to like help people get

push forward all this research
push forward all this research
definitely to go through this get back

to you. Thank you.
to you. Thank you.
I mean literally all the contributors

here like the only difference pretty
here like the only difference pretty
much is uh the ones who actually stuck

You have to have some basic level of

thing I can't fix. I have my programming
thing I can't fix. I have my programming
guide on like how to learn that stuff

quicker than normal, but that's the only
quicker than normal, but that's the only
thing I can't just like give you the

You have to be able to at least write

All right. So
that's going to set the course.
We got to do the ring check, right?
Did we got to do the ring check right
out of bounds?
Yes. Down here.
Oh my gosh, another one of these.
I love the headphones are broken bots.

One of these days I'm gonna end up
One of these days I'm gonna end up
banning somebody who's not actually a

are you guys hear me now?
Yeah.
Uh, is it visible?
Let's see what you're Let's see what
Let's see what you're Let's see what
you're looking at if I fix your bug real
you're looking at if I fix your bug real
quick.
quick.
Yeah.
You're showing
You're showing
this is
this is
you're only sharing the Discord
you're only sharing the Discord
application.
application.
Oh, really?
You have to share your screen.
You have to share your screen.
There's an application window.
Make a selection.
It says share all application windows.
It says share all application windows.
this one.
What's
still uh for some reason
enter screen. Okay, gotcha.
Okay, I think now
Okay, I think now
Okay.
Uh it's uh it's it's visible now.
Uh it's uh it's it's visible now.
Yeah. Let's see. So you have
Yeah. Let's see. So you have
Yeah. See, we're installing.
Okay.
Okay.
So,
So,
hey, why are you installing puffer lip
hey, why are you installing puffer lip
common?
common?
I have no idea. I I just do like UV
I have no idea. I I just do like UV
sync.
No, I mean uh I don't I have to build
No, I mean uh I don't I have to build
because I was trying uh the example.
because I was trying uh the example.
Yeah, but where where did you see the
Yeah, but where where did you see the
install common?
install common?
Common is a very heavy thing. Did you
Common is a very heavy thing. Did you
see somewhere in the docs that you
see somewhere in the docs that you
should like?
should like?
No, no. I I saw like if it it use u
No, no. I I saw like if it it use u
the UV. So my first instinct is kind of
the UV. So my first instinct is kind of
uh sync to get all the missing
uh sync to get all the missing
libraries.
libraries.
The sync just install and
come on just automatically installs
come on just automatically installs
common and that's just you being stupid.
common and that's just you being stupid.
I don't think it would do that though.
UV sync.
UV sync.
Well, I don't know if you have a clean
Well, I don't know if you have a clean
environment. What if you just UV pip
environment. What if you just UV pip
install dot
E
dot
dot
dot dot dot like period.
dot dot dot like period.
Okay.
If the UV dev can't even write good
If the UV dev can't even write good
tools, then I don't I don't know like
tools, then I don't I don't know like
language is a lost cause.
Yep.
Yep.
It's actually installing something now.
It's actually installing something now.
Yeah.
Like honestly, the Python tooling is
Like honestly, the Python tooling is
just terrible and like they keep making
just terrible and like they keep making
it worse.
Yeah, I think u
Yeah, I think u
like
like
like
for some reason
for some reason
Yeah, I think for some reason Enterprise
Yeah, I think for some reason Enterprise
does not like uh
does not like uh
Python for some reason.
Python for some reason.
Well, enterprise is generally like
Well, enterprise is generally like
terrible, terrible code in general. So I
terrible, terrible code in general. So I
don't trust anything out of Enterprise.
Um yeah, that's true. But um you know
Um yeah, that's true. But um you know
and and probably because they don't
and and probably because they don't
spend that much money um to Python and
spend that much money um to Python and
that's why it's for some reason it's not
that's why it's for some reason it's not
generalized how you know other other
generalized how you know other other
programming languages right now. It's a
programming languages right now. It's a
net java or something.
net java or something.
Yeah, I think yeah, it's uh it's
Yeah, I think yeah, it's uh it's
resolved my issue looks like. Yep.
resolved my issue looks like. Yep.
Can you run it? Like can you like puffer
Can you run it? Like can you like puffer
train puffer breakout?
It's like puffer breakout
r e
think I had to add something. You see
think I had to add something. You see
what that does?
what that does?
Because the mag.
Yeah, I know what I had to do.
Yeah, I know what I had to do.
It's
It's
right.
right.
If you don't have Yeah,
you miss device.
Mhm. Yep. It works fine.
Mhm. Yep. It works fine.
I don't know what I'm I don't know what
I don't know what I'm I don't know what
I'm supposed to do about that type of
I'm supposed to do about that type of
stuff if it's like UV being stupid. Like
stuff if it's like UV being stupid. Like
I don't know why the hectic was randomly
I don't know why the hectic was randomly
grabbing the common option out of
grabbing the common option out of
everything. Like if it's just going to
everything. Like if it's just going to
go randomly install optimals that are
go randomly install optimals that are
way heavier and require other
way heavier and require other
dependencies then like I don't know what
dependencies then like I don't know what
I'm supposed to do about that. That's
I'm supposed to do about that. That's
like the Python ecosystem just being
like the Python ecosystem just being
done.
done.
Yeah. No, I understand. So one quick
Yeah. No, I understand. So one quick
question. Let's say I I'm trying to uh
question. Let's say I I'm trying to uh
build my own custom environment. Uh on
build my own custom environment. Uh on
that case uh if I use you know buffer
that case uh if I use you know buffer
command then do I need to put my
command then do I need to put my
environment inside um ocean?
environment inside um ocean?
Yes. Um if you the reason I suggest
Yes. Um if you the reason I suggest
doing it this way is because otherwise
doing it this way is because otherwise
you have to handle your own C extension
you have to handle your own C extension
build system which unless you really
build system which unless you really
know what you're doing you don't want to
know what you're doing you don't want to
deal with your own C extension build
deal with your own C extension build
system. It is incredibly painful and
system. It is incredibly painful and
makes it's like an undocumented buggy
makes it's like an undocumented buggy
mess and it's because of Python. So like
mess and it's because of Python. So like
you're gonna fight like language um
you're gonna fight like language um
language level and like systems tooling
language level and like systems tooling
level issues if you do it yourself. You
level issues if you do it yourself. You
can absolutely do it, but like
can absolutely do it, but like
you can make it a lot it's a lot easier
you can make it a lot it's a lot easier
if you just basically copy our template
if you just basically copy our template
and then do like work from there.
and then do like work from there.
Yeah. because I was um I was kind of
Yeah. because I was um I was kind of
play around with the buffer
play around with the buffer
uh importable.
uh importable.
It looks like I had to deal with
It looks like I had to deal with
everything
everything
from the beginning. So that's why I'm
from the beginning. So that's why I'm
kind of uh
kind of uh
you can sim if you really want it like
you can sim if you really want it like
let's say that you have your own
let's say that you have your own
environment project, right? And you want
environment project, right? And you want
to have it in its own repo and stuff.
to have it in its own repo and stuff.
If you really want to, you can probably
If you really want to, you can probably
just sim link it,
just sim link it,
right? You have your puffer installed.
right? You have your puffer installed.
You can probably just sim link it in
You can probably just sim link it in
ocean. You probably still have to add
ocean. You probably still have to add
like the one line to environment, but
like the one line to environment, but
you can keep your environment code
you can keep your environment code
separate if you have to.
separate if you have to.
Okay. And I can use a buffer command
Okay. And I can use a buffer command
with it.
with it.
As long as it's in as long as you either
As long as it's in as long as you either
have your environment or you have what
have your environment or you have what
should I think a sim link in there
should I think a sim link in there
should work just as well.
should work just as well.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay. Yeah. That that that will make my
Okay. Yeah. That that that will make my
life. We will eventually figure out a
life. We will eventually figure out a
way to make this experience better so
way to make this experience better so
that you can like more easily have
that you can like more easily have
environments in custom places. But the
environments in custom places. But the
thing is like
thing is like
you have to at some point you need to
you have to at some point you need to
invoke an extension build system in
invoke an extension build system in
order to get the bindings to work in
order to get the bindings to work in
Python and uh that's really obnoxious,
Python and uh that's really obnoxious,
right?
right?
No, I I was kind of u trying out some uh
No, I I was kind of u trying out some uh
so I I need importable because you know
so I I need importable because you know
I'm trying to do something let's say so
I'm trying to do something let's say so
every time I come here and I'm I need to
every time I come here and I'm I need to
do all the commands instead of it's
do all the commands instead of it's
trying to build something as a platform
trying to build something as a platform
let's say I will interact from
let's say I will interact from
uh let's say a website and I can kind of
uh let's say a website and I can kind of
build general purpose uh thing so that I
build general purpose uh thing so that I
don't have to do everything manually
don't have to do everything manually
each time.
each time.
Y
Y
so that's why I was looking looking for
so that's why I was looking looking for
something that that I can integrate with
something that that I can integrate with
APIs like fast API or some other things
APIs like fast API or some other things
like importable here. So yeah, you can
like importable here. So yeah, you can
that's the reason I was absolutely all
that's the reason I was absolutely all
there like if you're relatively new to
there like if you're relatively new to
like the RL stuff though it the easiest
like the RL stuff though it the easiest
thing is going to be to play with stuff
thing is going to be to play with stuff
the way that we do it in our own
the way that we do it in our own
development first and then after that
development first and then after that
decide if you want to do all that other
decide if you want to do all that other
stuff right like I know it's very
stuff right like I know it's very
tempting to be like oh yeah let me just
tempting to be like oh yeah let me just
put this into something I'm familiar
put this into something I'm familiar
with first but like the way we do stuff
with first but like the way we do stuff
in our own internal dev is very very
in our own internal dev is very very
good for RL and um if you want to do it
good for RL and um if you want to do it
your own way, that's fine. But you
your own way, that's fine. But you
should absolutely like understand how
should absolutely like understand how
we're doing stuff first because RL is
we're doing stuff first because RL is
not trivial. And like there are a bunch
not trivial. And like there are a bunch
of moving parts. We've reduced it to as
of moving parts. We've reduced it to as
few moving parts as possible. But if you
few moving parts as possible. But if you
don't understand how those ones that are
don't understand how those ones that are
left uh are working together, you're not
left uh are working together, you're not
going to be in for a fun time.
going to be in for a fun time.
Yep. That that's why what I faced right
Yep. That that's why what I faced right
now.
now.
Yep. So
Yep. So
that then I I I changed that plan and
that then I I I changed that plan and
trying to understand as deep I can like
trying to understand as deep I can like
kind of recreating existing environment
kind of recreating existing environment
what we have on ocean
what we have on ocean
and then maybe start with like the
and then maybe start with like the
better of a time you're going to have
better of a time you're going to have
right the entire puffer lip source for
right the entire puffer lip source for
all this that you're going to touch is
all this that you're going to touch is
only a few a few thousand lines it's a
only a few a few thousand lines it's a
very short and succinct library uh it
very short and succinct library uh it
gives you a lot a lot of tools with not
gives you a lot a lot of tools with not
a lot of code and you can absolutely
a lot of code and you can absolutely
hack on it, but you're going to have a
hack on it, but you're going to have a
way better time if you understand how
way better time if you understand how
and why we're doing stuff first because
and why we're doing stuff first because
it's not the way that you will like it's
it's not the way that you will like it's
basically not the way anybody else does
basically not the way anybody else does
stuff and there's a very good reason for
stuff and there's a very good reason for
it,
it,
right?
right?
I understood. Yeah.
I understood. Yeah.
Like this is a this is like this is not
Like this is a this is like this is not
just like an out there library that does
just like an out there library that does
weird things for the sake of doing weird
weird things for the sake of doing weird
things. This is like reinforcement
things. This is like reinforcement
learning got nowhere for 10 years. Um,
learning got nowhere for 10 years. Um,
we had to completely rethink how it was
we had to completely rethink how it was
done in order to make everything fast
done in order to make everything fast
and sane and simple. That's why it is
and sane and simple. That's why it is
the way that it is.
It looks like
It looks like
it looks like you have this working now.
it looks like you have this working now.
Yeah. Yeah. No, thank you. Thank you for
Yeah. Yeah. No, thank you. Thank you for
your time. Yeah.
your time. Yeah.
All right. Yeah. I'm gonna hop off this,
All right. Yeah. I'm gonna hop off this,
right?
right?
Okay. All right.
Okay. All right.
Okay. Uh, looks like I got to go take a
Okay. Uh, looks like I got to go take a
call.
I'm going to go take a call, I think,
I'm going to go take a call, I think,
real quick. Um,
real quick. Um,
and then I've got two more meetings
and then I've got two more meetings
afterwards.
I'm going to give it like another
I'm going to give it like another
Let me at least see if I can just fix
Let me at least see if I can just fix
this one last bug and then I'll go see
this one last bug and then I'll go see
about my poll.
Why is this thing nearest?
Yes.
Okay. The intensity is n
max RPM because max RPM.
max RPM because max RPM.
Oh, I don't call it a drone dummy.
What's wrong with this?
Asan me copy.
Do I have this right?
Do I have this right?
Is it not getting is not getting cold or
Is it not getting is not getting cold or
something?
Is this not calic?
Is this not calic?
Oh yeah, this doesn't cal.
Okay, lovely.
This actually runs now.
Now,
can we train this on a specific task?
Oh, we need to adjust the binding file,
Oh, we need to adjust the binding file,
right? Cuz like we added max rings.
So, we'll just do
So, we'll just do
X rings.
Oops. All right, I got to go take a
Oops. All right, I got to go take a
call, it turns out. So, um, let me
call, it turns out. So, um, let me
answer this one question real quick.
answer this one question real quick.
Revisited my rain, uh, I revisited my
Revisited my rain, uh, I revisited my
implementation of the rainbow paper and
implementation of the rainbow paper and
got it
got it
to work with Puffer Lib. Have not tested
to work with Puffer Lib. Have not tested
it. What do you think I should do next?
it. What do you think I should do next?
Yeah. um get it on to puffer lib and run
Yeah. um get it on to puffer lib and run
it on like just pong and breakout
it on like just pong and breakout
basically. Just get the really basic
basically. Just get the really basic
environments working and then we'll go
environments working and then we'll go
next steps from there. That would be
next steps from there. That would be
yeah once you have something like that I
yeah once you have something like that I
will jump in and I will help more. I got
will jump in and I will help more. I got
to run yeah I got like three business
to run yeah I got like three business
meetings.
meetings.
I'd like to be streaming more stuff but
I'd like to be streaming more stuff but
hey got to grow the company. Um I will
hey got to grow the company. Um I will
be back probably tomorrow. What's
be back probably tomorrow. What's
tomorrow? Saturday. Yeah, I'll be back
tomorrow? Saturday. Yeah, I'll be back
tomorrow first thing with more stuff. If
tomorrow first thing with more stuff. If
you like what you see, if you're new
you like what you see, if you're new
around here, yada yada, all the things.

Okay.
Okay.
Should be live here.
Should be live here.
Hi.
Oops. Let's not show that.
Let me fix this real quick.
Why? Why can I not fix the stream?
There we go.
Okay,
here's the plan for today.
here's the plan for today.
First, we're going to post the article.
Welcome, RM.
I promised I would post uh the
I promised I would post uh the
educational article at 10K followers.
So, we are going to do that right now.
So, we are going to do that right now.
The only thing I have to figure out,
The only thing I have to figure out,
I've got two articles here. This one's
I've got two articles here. This one's
4K words. This one's 2K words.
So, the only thing I got to figure out
So, the only thing I got to figure out
is uh what images we're going to put on
is uh what images we're going to put on
here.
here.
I figured I would just do this live
I figured I would just do this live
while a stream warms up and we will go
while a stream warms up and we will go
from there. And then after that, we're
from there. And then after that, we're
going to work on drone things most
going to work on drone things most
likely.
I don't know. Let's just make something
I don't know. Let's just make something
real quick.
real quick.
uh
uh
guide
guide
image
52 ratio.
52 ratio.
So like
let's do I don't know what's like what's
let's do I don't know what's like what's
a good 52 ratio? Let's do like x300. So
a good 52 ratio? Let's do like x300. So
1,500
1,500
by like 600. Is that right?
I was just going to put like a basic
I was just going to put like a basic
like summary thing in the image maybe.
like summary thing in the image maybe.
Oh, let me also go grab the uh the
Oh, let me also go grab the uh the
puffer fish. So, of course, we're gonna
puffer fish. So, of course, we're gonna
have him in there.
We'll post the article. Shouldn't take
We'll post the article. Shouldn't take
me too long to do that. And then we will
me too long to do that. And then we will
do drone stuff for the rest of today.
Upper fish. PNG.
Upper fish. PNG.
Oops.
There we go. There's a puffer.
How's RL coming along?
How's RL coming along?
We have all sorts of fun stuff, man.
We have all sorts of fun stuff, man.
We've got uh the drone end is working
We've got uh the drone end is working
pretty well at this point.
pretty well at this point.
I think that the main thing I'm going to
I think that the main thing I'm going to
be working on today is like cleaning it
be working on today is like cleaning it
up and figuring out if we can get like
up and figuring out if we can get like
one policy, basically one policy that
one policy, basically one policy that
can do all the drone stuff we would ever
can do all the drone stuff we would ever
want. We just have like one really
want. We just have like one really
really good drone benchmark.
We shall see though.
That's the spirit. Yeah. I uh the one
That's the spirit. Yeah. I uh the one
thing is I always I hate having to do
thing is I always I hate having to do
thumbnails and like advertising type
thumbnails and like advertising type
work because it's just it's really
work because it's just it's really
obnoxious. So here if you have any ideas
obnoxious. So here if you have any ideas
actually we'll we'll crowdsource this.
actually we'll we'll crowdsource this.
Um,
Um,
so I have this article, my advice for
so I have this article, my advice for
programming in ML. I've got this one,
programming in ML. I've got this one,
the ultra opinionated guide to
the ultra opinionated guide to
reinforcement learning.
reinforcement learning.
And uh, we need to have some thumbnails
And uh, we need to have some thumbnails
for this. So, usually I do like AI gen.
for this. So, usually I do like AI gen.
I was thinking I would just actually for
I was thinking I would just actually for
these since these are more educational
these since these are more educational
materials, I would just like put some
materials, I would just like put some
basic summary stuff in it. Give it a
basic summary stuff in it. Give it a
follow.
follow.
Drop your X.
Drop your X.
We just hit 10K on it today actually,
We just hit 10K on it today actually,
which is really nice.
which is really nice.
I will put this in the chat.
There you go.
Why is Why are my notifications blowing
Why is Why are my notifications blowing
up?
That's fine.
Let me get into Twitter stuff here.
Let me get into Twitter stuff here.
I'm traveling and deving. Surely there's
I'm traveling and deving. Surely there's
an audience for me out there somewhere.
Oh, yeah. It's uh
Oh, yeah. It's uh
Twitter's been really good for pretty
Twitter's been really good for pretty
much everything.
much everything.
It's gotten us a lot of um I mean
It's gotten us a lot of um I mean
business side has done well from there
business side has done well from there
as well. Okay, let's see here. So, what
as well. Okay, let's see here. So, what
what do I write like?
I just think I go grab like the main
I just think I go grab like the main
topic points from the articles, right?
topic points from the articles, right?
Why are you making the guide image in
Why are you making the guide image in
Docs? It's not Docs. This is This is
Docs? It's not Docs. This is This is
Google Drawings.
Is Figma like actually good for like a
Is Figma like actually good for like a
basic editor that stays the hell out of
basic editor that stays the hell out of
your way?
Like I'll open or something if I
Like I'll open or something if I
need to do heavier stuff. Mostly I used
need to do heavier stuff. Mostly I used
Photoshop before but it's not the web
Photoshop before but it's not the web
version of Photoshop sucks and I'm on
version of Photoshop sucks and I'm on
Linux So,
Can I just copy all the the bolded like
Can I just copy all the the bolded like
titles?
That doesn't seem great.
I guess I could
I guess I could
Let's see if I just like start copying
Let's see if I just like start copying
these in if I like what this this does
these in if I like what this this does
or that I like the way that this looks.
Photoshop has
doing since Yeah, I've done I've done
doing since Yeah, I've done I've done
photo like Photoshop since I don't know
photo like Photoshop since I don't know
partway through high school as well.
partway through high school as well.
How's it been like to build a community
How's it been like to build a community
in such a non
in a non oh that is
in a non oh that is
okay a non-traditional way
okay a non-traditional way
there doubt you along from are there
there doubt you along from are there
doubt from you along the way it's really
doubt from you along the way it's really
not all that non-traditional
not all that non-traditional
if you think about it
if you think about it
I've kind of just basically what I've
I've kind of just basically what I've
done is I've taken very traditional very
done is I've taken very traditional very
very traditional credentials and then
very traditional credentials and then
I've done something non-traditional with
I've done something non-traditional with
them which is a hell of a lot easier,
them which is a hell of a lot easier,
right?
Cuz like I basically I've done like kind
Cuz like I basically I've done like kind
of semiindy dev stuff where I built like
of semiindy dev stuff where I built like
this community around this very compact
this community around this very compact
set of tools but it's also for a niche
set of tools but it's also for a niche
specialized topic. um that I have, you
specialized topic. um that I have, you
know, that I have a PhD in that I've
know, that I have a PhD in that I've
done actual academic research in for a
done actual academic research in for a
decade, right? So, it's kind of a blend.
decade, right? So, it's kind of a blend.
You're trying to make a thumbnail, you
You're trying to make a thumbnail, you
should try out Mid Journey,
should try out Mid Journey,
negative space, and overlap summaries.
Yeah, I've So, I've done that. If you
Yeah, I've So, I've done that. If you
click any of my articles on X, I've kind
click any of my articles on X, I've kind
of done a bunch of AI gen. I wanted to
of done a bunch of AI gen. I wanted to
have something different for this
I'm just going to try something, you
I'm just going to try something, you
know?
I don't really want AI gen crap. It's
I don't really want AI gen crap. It's
kind of funny. Like I really like um
kind of funny. Like I really like um
like all the AI stuff is cool, but I
like all the AI stuff is cool, but I
really don't like generative AI in most
really don't like generative AI in most
of what I do at all.
In some sense, it's like the least
In some sense, it's like the least
interesting part of AI to me.
at least as it is right now.
I think when you combine it with way
I think when you combine it with way
heavier RL than people are doing now,
heavier RL than people are doing now,

Okay, so here is the drone
Okay, so here is the drone
hyperparameter sweep. According
to this, it doesn't work at all, which
to this, it doesn't work at all, which
is
is
interesting to say the least because we
interesting to say the least because we
have it training with our current set of
have it training with our current set of
pipers. Something is weird there. We'll
pipers. Something is weird there. We'll
have to look at this. Disappointing. I
have to look at this. Disappointing. I
did also leave this going yesterday just
did also leave this going yesterday just
to see. So, I'm just curious.
like one.
like one.
Is this 100 bill? Yeah, this is 100
Is this 100 bill? Yeah, this is 100

really good. Okay, this could very
really good. Okay, this could very
easily be a soda experiment.
easily be a soda experiment.
What was our previous best?
I mean, it's not by a huge margin
I mean, it's not by a huge margin
though, right? It's like pretty close
though, right? It's like pretty close
for being a much larger policy. We'll
for being a much larger policy. We'll
let it run.
Learn the environments.
Learn the environments.
Welcome.
I must have done something wrong in the
I must have done something wrong in the
setup of that sweep because as you can
setup of that sweep because as you can
see it at least learns decently well
see it at least learns decently well
pretty instantly here.
So that's the super like these are tiny
So that's the super like these are tiny
drones and then sometimes it'll spawn
drones and then sometimes it'll spawn
bigger drones
bigger drones
and the idea here is it has to learn to

control a whole bunch of different types

What is the ideal way for me to compile
What is the ideal way for me to compile

incurses in buffer mode?
incurses in buffer mode?
So, do you mean as part of the PR is or
So, do you mean as part of the PR is or
for the pure C? So with the pure C, we
for the pure C? So with the pure C, we
could very easily make it so that the
could very easily make it so that the
set the um build ocean sh like that
set the um build ocean sh like that
script should just be able to take extra

And you're perfectly fine to do that. As
And you're perfectly fine to do that. As
long as you don't link that to literally

to your own, you're good.
Do you program in Vim?
Do you program in Vim?
Yeah, it's like Neo Vim with um
Yeah, it's like Neo Vim with um
two plugins or whatever.
You can see the uh the setup I have.
Okay. So, let me sort of walk you guys
Okay. So, let me sort of walk you guys
through what I'm thinking about right
through what I'm thinking about right
now. For the uh the drone sim, we
now. For the uh the drone sim, we
currently have two different uh drone
currently have two different uh drone
simulators. We have the racing one that
simulators. We have the racing one that
I just showed you, but we also have
I just showed you, but we also have
we have this swarm drone swarm sim.
Yeah, you should do that ideally.
So, obviously these guys aren't trained
So, obviously these guys aren't trained
to do anything,
to do anything,
but uh the demo that I did for this the
but uh the demo that I did for this the
other day was
we literally hit 10K this morning until
we literally hit 10K this morning until
10.1.
Let me find the demo I did for the drone
Let me find the demo I did for the drone
swarm.
Okay. Right. Like this.
Right.
So I think the thing that would like be
So I think the thing that would like be
really impressive and really really
really impressive and really really
generally useful, right, is if we could
generally useful, right, is if we could
just get a drone policy that does
just get a drone policy that does
everything.

Can we get a drone policy that can make
Can we get a drone policy that can make
flag constellations, that can beat human
flag constellations, that can beat human
pros at racing, that can like, you know,
pros at racing, that can like, you know,
follow targets? Just like have a policy

that does everything.
One big environment,

different drone form factors as well.
Just make that work somehow. Yeah.
Holy retweets Batman.
I have question. What is question?

Magic.
I'll answer a few while I'm thinking
I'll answer a few while I'm thinking
about how I want to make all the drone

stuff work with like one policy.
Is there sufficient

you can go look up the tiny box v1 and

see if they have specs.

the 4GPU machine. It's just the four uh
the 4GPU machine. It's just the four uh
the four GPU I'm all over the place
the four GPU I'm all over the place
today. The one GPU machines are uh
today. The one GPU machines are uh
they're just max spec to main gear
they're just max spec to main gear
boxes. So you can just basically just go

over to main gear, max everything, go
over to main gear, max everything, go
AMD build and that's pretty much what we
AMD build and that's pretty much what we

I have of making it redundant. It just

depends on how much I want to go problem
depends on how much I want to go problem
specific versus general. So, here's what
specific versus general. So, here's what
I'm trying to figure out at the moment,
I'm trying to figure out at the moment,
right? Like most of the goals that I
right? Like most of the goals that I
have are some version of go to position
have are some version of go to position
while avoiding collisions.
The ring target is slightly different

We have gotten it to work before where

it's truly multitask. So you just have
it's truly multitask. So you just have
the same policy doing different stuff.

don't butcher your first name.
You know, one thing that would actually

be really cool, we could make a train

I don't know how well that would do

I really need to make better collision
I really need to make better collision
checks at some point. You know, like our
checks at some point. You know, like our
collision check logic is not
collision check logic is not
great at the moment just generally.
But if I scrap that for now and at least
But if I scrap that for now and at least
I just try to merge these two into one
I just try to merge these two into one
big environment, I think we can do that.
And I can just give it like tasks,

No, actually the opposite. Uh, so like

So this one is like a little bit bigger
So this one is like a little bit bigger
than the last one. And it seems like it
than the last one. And it seems like it
handles a bit better

because we randomized the size, we

Yeah.
Yeah.
And uh I think
And uh I think
I was going to say stuff is important.
I was going to say stuff is important.
Yeah. What I was saying about the the
Yeah. What I was saying about the the
collision stuff is it was quite a while
collision stuff is it was quite a while
ago now. It was before drone was written
ago now. It was before drone was written
in Puffalib. This was back in back in
in Puffalib. This was back in back in
the the gym days. But I spent quite a
the the gym days. But I spent quite a
long time figuring out the the maths for
long time figuring out the the maths for
proper collisions with like
proper collisions with like
it doesn't require everything to be
it doesn't require everything to be
spheres. You can have planes and kind of
spheres. You can have planes and kind of
triangular stuff as well.
triangular stuff as well.
So that's helpful. The thing I was
So that's helpful. The thing I was
talking about even simpler. It's just
talking about even simpler. It's just
the fact that collision checking is
the fact that collision checking is
quadratic at the moment.
quadratic at the moment.
Um
Um
Oh, right. Okay. Like ideally what I
Oh, right. Okay. Like ideally what I
would do is I would make some sort of
would do is I would make some sort of
even just like a basic op tree would do

it.
I just don't want to actually have to do
I just don't want to actually have to do

that because it's a total pain.
But I will do that at some point.
But I will do that at some point.
It doesn't really matter because
It doesn't really matter because
like quadratic is fine up until like 256
like quadratic is fine up until like 256
512 agents don't even notice.
512 agents don't even notice.
So
So
anyways, let me tell you guys a little
anyways, let me tell you guys a little
bit about what I've been doing on this
bit about what I've been doing on this
and uh what I'm planning on doing here.
and uh what I'm planning on doing here.
So we now have it so that you can
So we now have it so that you can
randomize the size of the drone and then
randomize the size of the drone and then
there's also an additional randomization
there's also an additional randomization
constant or factor for physical
constant or factor for physical
properties. And what this does, so first
properties. And what this does, so first
you roll the size of the drone between I
you roll the size of the drone between I
believe it's between 5 cm and
believe it's between 5 cm and
uh like 8 mters or something
uh like 8 mters or something
five. It's it's like between a a very
five. It's it's like between a a very
small and like a mediumsiz drone, right?
small and like a mediumsiz drone, right?
And then what it does is it attempts to
And then what it does is it attempts to
estimate based on that some sort of
estimate based on that some sort of
reasonable weight and reasonable inertia
reasonable weight and reasonable inertia
parameters and all that and it
parameters and all that and it
randomizes those a little bit. So the
randomizes those a little bit. So the
idea is that you get pretty much any
idea is that you get pretty much any
sort of realistic or even somewhat
sort of realistic or even somewhat
unrealistic
unrealistic
drone imaginable. So it needs to it
drone imaginable. So it needs to it
should be able to learn to fly any type
should be able to learn to fly any type
of drone with the same policy.
Right. Okay.
Right. Okay.
So
So
where did you get those? Um I saw there
where did you get those? Um I saw there
were some sort of horistics about
were some sort of horistics about
choosing the the sizes and things. Where
choosing the the sizes and things. Where
where did you get those from? They just
where did you get those from? They just
kind of
kind of
freaking rock.
freaking rock.
Yeah. Fair enough.
Yeah. Fair enough.
Yeah. So, some of them are kind of
Yeah. So, some of them are kind of
obvious, right? Like mass should roughly
obvious, right? Like mass should roughly
scale the size cubed. No.
Uh yeah. Yeah.
Uh yeah. Yeah.
Right. Because it's it's if mass is
Right. Because it's it's if mass is
distributed evenly, trying to guess that
distributed evenly, trying to guess that
one
one
and then like some of the other ones
and then like some of the other ones
make sense and some of the other ones
make sense and some of the other ones
are more heristic.
are more heristic.
Um
Um
hello. So, I basically I wanted you guys
hello. So, I basically I wanted you guys
to take a look at those and see if
to take a look at those and see if
they're reasonable because what we would
they're reasonable because what we would
like to see in the sim is we would like
like to see in the sim is we would like
to see the drones handling more or less
to see the drones handling more or less
the way that you would expect. I haven't
the way that you would expect. I haven't
really seen a ton about the drones, like
really seen a ton about the drones, like
actually flying them. Uh, which I we
actually flying them. Uh, which I we
should probably all do that at some
should probably all do that at some
point, but you'd expect that the smaller
point, but you'd expect that the smaller
ones are going to be zippier and have
ones are going to be zippier and have
really tight turning radiuses, right?
really tight turning radiuses, right?
And then the bigger ones are going to
And then the bigger ones are going to
have a lot more weight and inertia to
have a lot more weight and inertia to
them. So, we'd like to see that happen
them. So, we'd like to see that happen
in the sim, right? That's the goal. And
in the sim, right? That's the goal. And
then you can fly any drone with one
then you can fly any drone with one
policy. And then the next thing I'm
policy. And then the next thing I'm
doing is I'm going to actually make it
doing is I'm going to actually make it
so the same policy can do a ton of
so the same policy can do a ton of
different tasks. So, like not only will
different tasks. So, like not only will
you have a policy that can be a
you have a policy that can be a
ridiculously good race uh drone racer,
ridiculously good race uh drone racer,
but at the same time like the same
but at the same time like the same
policy should be able to go make the
policy should be able to go make the
flag or like orbit in a sphere or do any
flag or like orbit in a sphere or do any
of the other tasks because they're all
of the other tasks because they're all
some form of go to point with the ring.
some form of go to point with the ring.
It's like go to point from the right
It's like go to point from the right
side, but no big deal. Same thing.
side, but no big deal. Same thing.
Uh, so we should basically be able to
Uh, so we should basically be able to
train it on a huge number of randomized
train it on a huge number of randomized
tasks and randomized drones. And then
tasks and randomized drones. And then
with that much diversity in the policy,
with that much diversity in the policy,
there's probably going to be some
there's probably going to be some
fiddling around to get it to work on the
fiddling around to get it to work on the
real hardware, but uh, that's it.
real hardware, but uh, that's it.

we have isn't it
like we have puffer lip if you think
like we have puffer lip if you think
about it there's one trainer file there
about it there's one trainer file there
is the vectorzation file there is for
is the vectorzation file there is for
each environment and this is a slightly
each environment and this is a slightly
annoying bit right each environment has
annoying bit right each environment has
a python file it has a binding file it
a python file it has a binding file it
has ah file where all the code is and
has ah file where all the code is and
then the C file is just so that you can
then the C file is just so that you can
play with it in pure C, right? So you
play with it in pure C, right? So you
don't have to dev with the compile to
don't have to dev with the compile to
Python every time.
Python every time.
Yes, that's that's pretty much like
Yes, that's that's pretty much like
close to my setup too. It's it's I mean
close to my setup too. It's it's I mean
for what it's pretty much copied to your
for what it's pretty much copied to your
setup, right? So it's the same code as
setup, right? So it's the same code as
well. So I mean
well. So I mean
I think I think the actual sauce the
I think I think the actual sauce the
sauce is like the trainer the there's
sauce is like the trainer the there's
like that CUDA thing that you've done
like that CUDA thing that you've done
and then also the vectorzation file
and then also the vectorzation file
which I think just
which I think just
compiles it with certain flags or
compiles it with certain flags or
something. I'm not sure what that does
something. I'm not sure what that does
to be honest.
to be honest.
What the vectorzation file? Yeah, like
What the vectorzation file? Yeah, like
the VC VC enth I just I can kind of
the VC VC enth I just I can kind of
guess.
guess.
Oh, that's so what that is that is sort
Oh, that's so what that is that is sort
of like a Python implementation of N
of like a Python implementation of N
pool if you've seen that.
pool if you've seen that.
Okay.
Okay.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
So it's pure Python but everything is
So it's pure Python but everything is
done through shared memory. So the
done through shared memory. So the
secret source of puffer lib being fast
secret source of puffer lib being fast
with C is that when you are writing your
with C is that when you are writing your
environment the observations are going
environment the observations are going
directly into shared memory that's
directly into shared memory that's
available immediately on the main thread
available immediately on the main thread
with no redundant copy operations.
with no redundant copy operations.
Okay. Yeah. I actually have done
Okay. Yeah. I actually have done
something similar with doing Conway's
something similar with doing Conway's
game of life with a Go server that was
game of life with a Go server that was
pushing packets to a website which would
pushing packets to a website which would
render it and I had this double
render it and I had this double
buffering thing happening with CUDA and
buffering thing happening with CUDA and
uh it would just you kind of have to
uh it would just you kind of have to
control the memory to keep things really
control the memory to keep things really
really quick.
really quick.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh so it's it is most of our stuff is
Uh so it's it is most of our stuff is
double buffered. Uh it supports more
double buffered. Uh it supports more
than that. You can triple or quad
than that. You can triple or quad
buffer. For instance, in Puffer 2, we
buffer. For instance, in Puffer 2, we
actually had it so you could do full
actually had it so you could do full
async. So, it's not even buffered. It
async. So, it's not even buffered. It
just takes data as it's ready.
just takes data as it's ready.
We got rid of that for now in 3.0
We got rid of that for now in 3.0
because
because
it breaks the way that our new trainer
it breaks the way that our new trainer
collects segments. Um, okay. The other
collects segments. Um, okay. The other
secret sauce. Did you read the uh like
secret sauce. Did you read the uh like
the puffing up PO article? It's super
the puffing up PO article? It's super
short.
short.
I will read it soon. I've been mostly
I will read it soon. I've been mostly
just heads down.
just heads down.
Yeah, I got
Yeah, I got
running training running your training
running training running your training
loop over and over again. Changing the

Yeah. a training loop.
Yeah. a training loop.
There are a couple things we're doing
There are a couple things we're doing
that are non-standard that will probably
that are non-standard that will probably
benefit you to understand. Um,
benefit you to understand. Um,
so we're not quite doing PO. It is built
so we're not quite doing PO. It is built
on PO, but we've done our own research
on PO, but we've done our own research
and advancements. It's a generational
and advancements. It's a generational
leap over PO. Uh, everybody claims that
leap over PO. Uh, everybody claims that
and they are all wrong. Ours actually
and they are all wrong. Ours actually
does work.
does work.
Uh, and the reason that we know that is
Uh, and the reason that we know that is
because it's 40,000 experiments.
because it's 40,000 experiments.
Yes, I've been like running it and using
Yes, I've been like running it and using
it over and over again and it actually
it over and over again and it actually
just it's actually kind of remarkable
just it's actually kind of remarkable
how easily it works. It's pretty pretty
how easily it works. It's pretty pretty
astounding to be honest.
astounding to be honest.
So that that article has all of the
So that that article has all of the
advancements that made that possible. Uh
advancements that made that possible. Uh
it's a pretty simple set of
it's a pretty simple set of
modifications to PO but like the stuff
modifications to PO but like the stuff
that actually mattered honestly muon was
that actually mattered honestly muon was
a big part of it and then I think
a big part of it and then I think
trajectory segment filtering was the
trajectory segment filtering was the
other big part and then the other stuff
other big part and then the other stuff
was more minor.
was more minor.
Okay. When are we getting voltage and
Okay. When are we getting voltage and
drone flags?

uh
yeah,
yeah,
you can see mine is much smaller and
you can see mine is much smaller and
more concentrated. Like I very rarely

post things outside of direct RL. So
post things outside of direct RL. So
it's like a really just like poor tech
it's like a really just like poor tech
poor technical audience.
poor technical audience.
A technical audience a a technical

nontechnical followers. And in fact, you
nontechnical followers. And in fact, you
saturate your bubble astoundingly fast.
saturate your bubble astoundingly fast.
And I think part of the reason I don't
And I think part of the reason I don't
I've never planned to actually have this
I've never planned to actually have this
much reach. And I think the reason I
much reach. And I think the reason I
have this much reach is because I change
have this much reach is because I change
interests every three months. I get like

hyper obsessed about something. Right
hyper obsessed about something. Right
now it's like reinforcement learning and

like robot control.

So I'm going to gain some followers who
So I'm going to gain some followers who
are like, "Oh, this person's posting
are like, "Oh, this person's posting
about robot control." And then like next
about robot control." And then like next
week it'll be woodworking and then I'll
week it'll be woodworking and then I'll
gain some followers who are talking
gain some followers who are talking
about woodworking. But if you keep on
about woodworking. But if you keep on
posting cool stuff like once Finn and
posting cool stuff like once Finn and
Sam actually do the symmet which is
Sam actually do the symmet which is
going to be very interesting and very
going to be very interesting and very
fun. Um, and you guys have an actual I

now like as I understand it like that
now like as I understand it like that
you're trying to push the drone policy
you're trying to push the drone policy
onto, right?

Yeah. I just I sent them a basic drone
Yeah. I just I sent them a basic drone
to like start fiddling with. I'm

traveling for a bit so it's not as easy
traveling for a bit so it's not as easy
but once I get back
but once I get back
to the farm I'll be there probably order

it's like oh yeah that's the hardware

trying to do RL and it's everybody just

underestimates the price of complexity

and now that's true in software
and now that's true in software
generally but it's especially true in

reinforcement learning is
reinforcement learning is
when stuff just breaks, you don't get
when stuff just breaks, you don't get

doesn't train, right?
doesn't train, right?
So like the
So like the
in fact I'm even guilty of this. So when
in fact I'm even guilty of this. So when
I first got in like when I was newish to
I first got in like when I was newish to
RL even a couple years in and clean RL
RL even a couple years in and clean RL
was becoming a thing I just thought okay
was becoming a thing I just thought okay
this is dumb why you just have like this
this is dumb why you just have like this
300line script and that was I've never

been more wrong about something
been more wrong about something
technically. Clean RL is a godsend and

insight was like, what if we just do
insight was like, what if we just do
this in the simplest way possible and
this in the simplest way possible and
make it super hackable? And what I've
make it super hackable? And what I've
done with Puffer is try to keep it as
done with Puffer is try to keep it as
simple as possible while also making it
simple as possible while also making it
fast. Um,
fast. Um,
I mean, it's like I can be like I I can
I mean, it's like I can be like I I can
testify that it is a very hackable. I
testify that it is a very hackable. I
mean, I literally just went to the

I mean, that's exactly right. Like,
I mean, that's exactly right. Like,
you're kind of like iterating on this
you're kind of like iterating on this

Uh no this is the first time I've ever
Uh no this is the first time I've ever
trained RL models. I've actually so two

important thing is I I can understand
important thing is I I can understand

happening. And when I understand things
happening. And when I understand things
at their fundamental level, then I can
at their fundamental level, then I can
understand what's possible to do. And I
understand what's possible to do. And I
mean I'm I'm getting really excited
mean I'm I'm getting really excited
because I mean the thing I'm trying to
because I mean the thing I'm trying to
do is kind of uh it's I'm trying to uh
do is kind of uh it's I'm trying to uh
meme. Uh so I have a hard hat which I
meme. Uh so I have a hard hat which I
bought because I was at with my kid.
bought because I was at with my kid.
It was right next to the Chinese place I
It was right next to the Chinese place I
was ordering food from. And I want to
was ordering food from. And I want to
make it fly and I think like I can make
make it fly and I think like I can make
it fly. Doesn't seem that like
it fly. Doesn't seem that like
complicated to simulate. I mean if if I
complicated to simulate. I mean if if I
can run your code and hack on your code
can run your code and hack on your code
that's like making a a drone fly. And I
that's like making a a drone fly. And I
I also added I I know you guys are
I also added I I know you guys are
working on domain randomization and I
working on domain randomization and I
did that yesterday. I added mass
did that yesterday. I added mass
randomization. Um, and
randomization. Um, and
oh, take a look at the function we added
oh, take a look at the function we added
for that. So, it can now fly like all
for that. So, it can now fly like all
different sizes of drones with like kind
different sizes of drones with like kind
of reasonableish estimates and
of reasonableish estimates and
randomized masses, lengths, inertia. Um,
randomized masses, lengths, inertia. Um,
there's a whole bunch of stuff and it it
there's a whole bunch of stuff and it it
still flies like all sorts of different
still flies like all sorts of different
drones.
drones.
It's it's kind of remarkable like I I
It's it's kind of remarkable like I I
trained them I didn't train a new neural
trained them I didn't train a new neural
network
network
and it was still able to fly ever. Yeah,
and it was still able to fly ever. Yeah,
it was it's it's kind of neural networks
it was it's it's kind of neural networks
are actually kind of amazing. Uh, neural
are actually kind of amazing. Uh, neural
networks are are are actually
networks are are are actually
remarkable. And so so I guess I'll give
remarkable. And so so I guess I'll give
you it's so small. It it'll run
you it's so small. It it'll run
on a potato.
on a potato.
Yeah, dude. It'll run on a potato. Like
Yeah, dude. It'll run on a potato. Like
this is this is I don't understand any.
this is this is I don't understand any.
Anyways, um I'm very excited. Uh so I'll
Anyways, um I'm very excited. Uh so I'll
give you guys some advice about this is
give you guys some advice about this is
how I'm going to go about getting my
how I'm going to go about getting my
hard hat to fly. I'm going to 3D print a
hard hat to fly. I'm going to 3D print a
vertical a vertical thing, which is
vertical a vertical thing, which is
basically like a modulation of like some
basically like a modulation of like some
some aluminum extrusion, right? And I'm
some aluminum extrusion, right? And I'm
going to attach that to a brushless
going to attach that to a brushless
motor so it can only go up and down. So
motor so it can only go up and down. So
I'm going to put some WD40 on it. I'm
I'm going to put some WD40 on it. I'm
going to have a Newton meter at the
going to have a Newton meter at the
bottom of it. And I'm going to make the
bottom of it. And I'm going to make the
brushless motor. I'm just going to send
brushless motor. I'm just going to send
ESC commands to it to set at a certain
ESC commands to it to set at a certain
speed. And I'm going to measure the rate
speed. And I'm going to measure the rate
at which the speed can change, at which
at which the speed can change, at which
the force can change. And I'm going to
the force can change. And I'm going to
try to model it the best I can in an
try to model it the best I can in an
environment. And then I'm going to model
environment. And then I'm going to model
the environment and then have it like
the environment and then have it like
basically randomize. And then I'm going
basically randomize. And then I'm going
to try to do some tore to that. Yeah.
to try to do some tore to that. Yeah.
Exactly. Then I'm going to move it over.
Exactly. Then I'm going to move it over.
And basically the goal will be try to
And basically the goal will be try to
float halfway through the thing. And I
float halfway through the thing. And I
think it will work. Um, and there's the
think it will work. Um, and there's the
way I'm going to measure the the length
way I'm going to measure the the length
that it's going to be. Uh, I haven't
that it's going to be. Uh, I haven't
figured out yet, but it it seems like it
figured out yet, but it it seems like it
should be that not too too difficult to
should be that not too too difficult to
do. I could probably even do it just
do. I could probably even do it just
computer vision. Um, but once I have it
computer vision. Um, but once I have it
working on one axis, then I'm going to
working on one axis, then I'm going to
move over to actually get having
move over to actually get having
something fly. I feel like that's going
something fly. I feel like that's going
to be a little bit easier and it's also
to be a little bit easier and it's also
going to like shorten the time where I
going to like shorten the time where I
actually have symptoms. Like like my
actually have symptoms. Like like my
goal right now is like I need Sim to
goal right now is like I need Sim to
reel today. If I want my hard hat to fly
reel today. If I want my hard hat to fly
by, let's say Tuesday, I need SIM to
by, let's say Tuesday, I need SIM to
reel to work today. And I don't think I
reel to work today. And I don't think I
can get my hard hat to fly today, I
can get my hard hat to fly today, I
probably can get this 3D printed this 3D
probably can get this 3D printed this 3D
printed thing and I can get a brushless
printed thing and I can get a brushless
motor and I can have it have it like uh
motor and I can have it have it like uh
have it have it have it create some
have it have it have it create some
thrust. Like I can try that, right? Like
thrust. Like I can try that, right? Like
and the thing I'm I'm trying to like do
and the thing I'm I'm trying to like do
is like reduce the reduce the amount of
is like reduce the reduce the amount of
requirements such that I get to a point.
requirements such that I get to a point.
I think like doing a I mean I could
I think like doing a I mean I could
possibly get a drone as well and um
possibly get a drone as well and um
simil I think we can get that to work
simil I think we can get that to work
for you. It's like I pretty much just
for you. It's like I pretty much just
have to show you the way that we
have to show you the way that we
actually domain randomize stuff. Um it's
actually domain randomize stuff. Um it's
a lot harder with actual super
a lot harder with actual super
highdimensional robotics because you
highdimensional robotics because you
can't randomize all the relevant stuff,
can't randomize all the relevant stuff,
but I think it shouldn't be that hard
but I think it shouldn't be that hard
with something like this.
with something like this.
I mean I have it working with mass and
I mean I have it working with mass and
it works pretty well. Like the the only
it works pretty well. Like the the only
it fails on 0. So, I have the mass
it fails on 0. So, I have the mass
randomizing from 0.1 kg to 3.5. It works
randomizing from 0.1 kg to 3.5. It works
above 0.5 to 3.5 kg. I actually just
above 0.5 to 3.5 kg. I actually just
like went out to Costco and I just
like went out to Costco and I just
trained a model for
trained a model for
uh as long as it like I trained it for
uh as long as it like I trained it for
like 500 million instead of one I can't
like 500 million instead of one I can't
even remember. I just like added a bunch
even remember. I just like added a bunch
of zeros to it.
of zeros to it.
Um so I'm going to try that and see if
Um so I'm going to try that and see if
that works. But I mean I don't know. And
that works. But I mean I don't know. And
like I'm excited too because like just
like I'm excited too because like just
the 30 second training loop dude just
the 30 second training loop dude just
means that you can actually
means that you can actually
hyperparameter sweep.
hyperparameter sweep.
Have you tried 13 yet? No, I have not.
Have you tried 13 yet? No, I have not.
I'm really excited.
I'm really excited.
You have to get it set up properly. Uh
You have to get it set up properly. Uh
there's one obnoxious quirk with it that
there's one obnoxious quirk with it that
I didn't have time to fix before 3 0. Um
I didn't have time to fix before 3 0. Um
that it doesn't like always work the way
that it doesn't like always work the way
it's supposed to work perfectly, but
it's supposed to work perfectly, but
when it does, like this is how we got
when it does, like this is how we got
breakout speed running. Solve breakout
breakout speed running. Solve breakout
under 20 seconds. Solve pawn in 3
under 20 seconds. Solve pawn in 3
seconds. It's our own hyperparameter
seconds. It's our own hyperparameter
tuning algorithm. Like you can read the
tuning algorithm. Like you can read the
article on it. I actually had to do some
article on it. I actually had to do some
math for once for that.
math for once for that.
Okay, I'll I'll I'll read it. And I
Okay, I'll I'll I'll read it. And I
think that like
think that like
they're all pretty short and easy to
they're all pretty short and easy to
read. The way I have things pulled out
read. The way I have things pulled out
basically means that I'll be able to
basically means that I'll be able to
like rip out what you guys are doing and
like rip out what you guys are doing and
I actually just like run it on my own
I actually just like run it on my own
thing because I have like really strange
thing because I have like really strange
infrastructure like

again like I have like a train.sh which
again like I have like a train.sh which
you know sends my code over to my server
you know sends my code over to my server
rebuilds the Python bindings trains it

know open a pipelot on my on my on my on
know open a pipelot on my on my on my on
my laptop every like uh every like x
my laptop every like uh every like x
amount of epochs and then um

you can do that. I feel like yeah
you can do that. I feel like yeah
if you want to replicate existing stuff
if you want to replicate existing stuff
I'd suggest at least not dropping the
I'd suggest at least not dropping the
core features that we have because like
core features that we have because like
it's a small set and they're really
it's a small set and they're really
useful like the local dashboard for
useful like the local dashboard for
instance that we have is really useful
instance that we have is really useful
for fixing performance bugs. Um the

that I kept like the the dashboard I

kept. It's like very very useful to just
kept. It's like very very useful to just
see it like actually ripping and like

when I make a clear mistake it's like
when I make a clear mistake it's like
the the numbers look and yeah or

sorry for cursing but yeah.
sorry for cursing but yeah.
So you don't super need over like just a
So you don't super need over like just a
pie plot thing for individual runs. When
pie plot thing for individual runs. When
it's really helpful is when you have
it's really helpful is when you have
sweeps and you need like scatters for
sweeps and you need like scatters for
every hyperp because you're like doing
every hyperp because you're like doing
sensitivity analysis and stuff.
sensitivity analysis and stuff.
Okay.
Okay.
Like that's that's what that's for. like
Like that's that's what that's for. like
we there's more advanced analysis
we there's more advanced analysis
basically that that stuff supports.
basically that that stuff supports.
Um I don't like it either. I don't like
Um I don't like it either. I don't like
that. They all suck, but like you need
that. They all suck, but like you need
something that does it.
something that does it.
What I'm doing is I'm dumping all the
What I'm doing is I'm dumping all the
logs to a JSON line file and then I just
logs to a JSON line file and then I just
like open that up with like a notebook
like open that up with like a notebook
and I just like hack with plots that I
and I just like hack with plots that I
need to. So I feel like I mean I can
need to. So I feel like I mean I can
generate

to be like last data point scatters over

make a hard because no one can do that.
That's And here's another thing from
That's And here's another thing from
demos like that is that like the thing
demos like that is that like the thing
is I guess they're not as easy like
is I guess they're not as easy like
visually obvious as that and that's what
visually obvious as that and that's what
we're working on. We have all sorts of
we're working on. We have all sorts of

that into a product? Right. Effectively,
that into a product? Right. Effectively,
for you to like create an actual
for you to like create an actual
physical product, you would have to

raise the capital to do it. But what you
raise the capital to do it. But what you
can do is you can go to a customer who
can do is you can go to a customer who
already has a bunch of capital and
already has a bunch of capital and
you're like, "Hey, I'll create this

probably take you a week after to make
probably take you a week after to make

Um,
Um,
basically reinforcement learning killed

academics they killed their own field
academics they killed their own field
by
by
essentially just being a bunch of
essentially just being a bunch of
bookworms. Like
bookworms. Like
yep,
yep,
it they literally like they made slower
it they literally like they made slower
and slower benchmarks and then they
and slower benchmarks and then they
adopted like slower and slower best
adopted like slower and slower best

The GPUs they did have they were running
The GPUs they did have they were running
at like 1% utilization and yeah the

I'm crying. I'm actually crying.

So I'm happened was not

It's kind of a meme. Like, I'm kind of
It's kind of a meme. Like, I'm kind of
joking, goofing around. I still haven't

actually learned RL. It's probably going
actually learned RL. It's probably going
to take me probably three months to

really like understand everything. I
really like understand everything. I
said, "Oh, like I learned reinforcement

learning in two weeks."
learning in two weeks."
Read the guide.
Read the guide.
And someone someone repl
And someone someone repl
the the guide. I might actually learn it
the the guide. I might actually learn it
in two weeks with a guide. Um, but one
in two weeks with a guide. Um, but one
person responded to me, "Oh, get a Oh,
person responded to me, "Oh, get a Oh,
really? Prove it to me by getting a
really? Prove it to me by getting a

to you, but instead of by doing instead
to you, but instead of by doing instead
of getting a paper accepted, how about I
of getting a paper accepted, how about I
make a million dollars with RL? Would
make a million dollars with RL? Would
you believe me then?" And I feel like,
you believe me then?" And I feel like,
you know,
you know,
no,
no,
I mean, I think that I could actually
I mean, I think that I could actually
make good money with reinforcement
make good money with reinforcement
learning. There's a lot of things that I
learning. There's a lot of things that I
mean, even just like think think about
mean, even just like think think about
this, like you I don't know if you've
this, like you I don't know if you've
played World of Warcraft, but I did when
played World of Warcraft, but I did when
I was younger.
I was younger.
If I could get
If I could get
MMOs were my PhD, man. I literally did

So
So
I if you made me a World of Warcraft
I if you made me a World of Warcraft
figurine that did the World of Warcraft

I would buy it for $500. I would buy it.

I've been watching like all the YouTube
I've been watching like all the YouTube
videos and reading all the papers and

the actual hard part

Uh it's just a mess. But I don't know.
Uh it's just a mess. But I don't know.
I'm getting back in shape. What I did uh
I'm getting back in shape. What I did uh
I have I'm not there at the moment, but
I have I'm not there at the moment, but
the the warehouse streams I have all the
the the warehouse streams I have all the
weights behind me and I just

Yeah, dude. I saw you had you had an
Yeah, dude. I saw you had you had an
American flag and actually like behind
American flag and actually like behind
me I have a squat rack myself and I have
me I have a squat rack myself and I have
a Canadian flag. So, you know,
a Canadian flag. So, you know,
I got to get my uh I got patella
I got to get my uh I got patella
tendonitis. I got to get that fixed so I
tendonitis. I got to get that fixed so I
can squat again. Deadlift is back up to
can squat again. Deadlift is back up to
like 350 four some reps though. So, I
like 350 four some reps though. So, I
don't know. I haven't tried to max it
don't know. I haven't tried to max it
lately, but it's getting close to back.
lately, but it's getting close to back.
I I'm getting a little older and my uh
I I'm getting a little older and my uh
approach to weightlifting is I don't go
approach to weightlifting is I don't go
over what is like what a regular strong
over what is like what a regular strong
dude would do and I just make sure to do
dude would do and I just make sure to do
it for higher reps because I'm kind of
it for higher reps because I'm kind of
worried about just like messing my

Yeah. I honestly it's like repetitive

Okay. Interesting. Yeah.

600 pounds is insane though.
600 pounds is insane though.
No, 600 is uh that's very different from

I've been kind of studying hard sciences
I've been kind of studying hard sciences
in my uh my spare time a little bit
in my uh my spare time a little bit
trying to think about this stuff. But

it's probably going to be the case that

Then I can probably do something early

The thing is that I would need to here's

they'll agree with it but they won't

You can actually get Atari to go from
You can actually get Atari to go from
500 steps per second training to like

20,000 steps per second training. That's
at least like kind of something horrible
at least like kind of something horrible

our 3 that makes everything like

didn't have our own algorithmic research
didn't have our own algorithmic research
in there. Um 40 will have a lot more on

that I'm sure and I yeah it's just
that I'm sure and I yeah it's just
there's been there's been a lot of stuff
there's been there's been a lot of stuff
with this actually there are several

pretty sure we can make the small nets
pretty sure we can make the small nets
run at 20 30 million a second if we're
run at 20 30 million a second if we're

smart. Um, so we can literally have like
instant dev loops. That's going to take
instant dev loops. That's going to take
more work though.
more work though.
That's I like I don't think people
That's I like I don't think people
understand that, dude. Like the thing is
understand that, dude. Like the thing is
like you're saying that to me and I I
like you're saying that to me and I I
can see it and I don't
can see it and I don't
you just comput flops, right? It's
you just comput flops, right? It's
literally just like what's I mean you
literally just like what's I mean you
don't even have to compute flops.
don't even have to compute flops.
Literally just take run a perf test on a
Literally just take run a perf test on a
thousand hidden dim LSTM. Okay, it's
thousand hidden dim LSTM. Okay, it's
quadratic with hidden size. So it should
quadratic with hidden size. So it should

believe so. All right. It's not 64x
believe so. All right. It's not 64x

faster. It's like 3x faster. Well, then
there's like a gap of 20x. Duh.
there's like a gap of 20x. Duh.
Yep.
Yep.

Yep.
That's it.
That's it.
How fun. Uh, one of the things I was
How fun. Uh, one of the things I was
thinking about like simplifying stuff on
thinking about like simplifying stuff on
on my end. If I had the time to do this,
on my end. If I had the time to do this,
I would probably have ended up doing
I would probably have ended up doing
this is doing the pietorch from C. Just
this is doing the pietorch from C. Just
like calling PyTorch bindings from C and
like calling PyTorch bindings from C and
just having everything in C. So the
just having everything in C. So the

Uh
Uh
yeah, if I do that, nobody else would
yeah, if I do that, nobody else would
use my stuff.
use my stuff.
That's a problem. E
That's a problem. E
and it's not I wish if PyTorch actually
and it's not I wish if PyTorch actually
had C, I would consider it. They have
had C, I would consider it. They have
kind of shitty C++
kind of shitty C++

like uh
Oh.
Oh.
Yeah, it's annoying.
Yeah, it's annoying.
Yeah, Python it is.
Yeah, Python it is.
Yeah, I really don't like the way it's
Yeah, I really don't like the way it's
set up. Um I I wish I could just write

more stuff and save, but it's kind of

fine. Like

Yeah, it's fine.
Yeah, it's fine.

You know, the MS have to be really

Honestly, the stuff that's going to be

yeah,
yeah,
that's probably the only part that's
that's probably the only part that's

Like you need to be running updates more
Like you need to be running updates more
frequently. And if your dev loop is
frequently. And if your dev loop is
tighter, then you can make literally
tighter, then you can make literally
that much pro that much progress. If
that much pro that much progress. If
your dev loop is 100 times faster, you
your dev loop is 100 times faster, you
will make progress 100 times faster than

think that you need to deeply understand

for Perf and it's often the simplest

actually I tried to do like full
actually I tried to do like full
procedural stuff in Python and the
procedural stuff in Python and the
result was just really really stupid

doing anything wrong. It's that the
doing anything wrong. It's that the
language itself like languages force you

when people say the language doesn't

Yeah, that's true. I really hate Python,

That's not scale. Scale needs when you

Okay.
Okay.
Like and by the way, you know, when I

about puffer, you can kind of just copy
about puffer, you can kind of just copy
paste puffer code into CUDA. CUDA is

complexity is the devil. I hate it. Why
do people keep on adding a complexity?
do people keep on adding a complexity?
Stop.
Stop.
So, actually the thing that I would
So, actually the thing that I would
really like to have, which Have you ever
really like to have, which Have you ever
used Syon?
used Syon?
I know.
I know.
So, Syon is like you can write Python
So, Syon is like you can write Python
and you can write C in the same file.
and you can write C in the same file.
Oh, wow.
Oh, wow.
Uh it's great in concept. In practice,
Uh it's great in concept. In practice,
the compiler is a buggy mess and like
the compiler is a buggy mess and like
gives you tons of crappy errors. But if
gives you tons of crappy errors. But if
you had that but good like the ability
you had that but good like the ability
to quickly switch between something for
to quickly switch between something for
like you don't want to do stream
like you don't want to do stream
processing of C for instance like just
processing of C for instance like just
like basic. It's a pain in the ass,
like basic. It's a pain in the ass,
right? You don't care if it's fast, you
right? You don't care if it's fast, you
just want it to work. You want it to not
just want it to work. You want it to not
be a bunch of lines. um easily switching
be a bunch of lines. um easily switching
between these two things would be
between these two things would be
way way better, but it just doesn't work
way way better, but it just doesn't work
at the moment. Like we have to go
at the moment. Like we have to go
through the Python C API, which is a
through the Python C API, which is a
bloated buggy mess.
bloated buggy mess.
Every time you add something from the
Every time you add something from the
outside, it's usually a buggy bloated
outside, it's usually a buggy bloated
buggy mess. Like dependencies are really
buggy mess. Like dependencies are really
bad unless you can actually read all the
bad unless you can actually read all the
dependencies and change them yourself.
dependencies and change them yourself.
Yeah, it's I mean it's tough. It's like
Yeah, it's I mean it's tough. It's like
at some point it's like I don't want to
at some point it's like I don't want to
write my own graphics engine, right? I
write my own graphics engine, right? I
want a lightweight one. Okay, Ray Ray is
want a lightweight one. Okay, Ray Ray is
perfect. It already exists.
perfect. It already exists.
I mean, the thing about Rayb and I think
I mean, the thing about Rayb and I think
there's also soal and all these like
there's also soal and all these like
graphics libraries is that they're super
graphics libraries is that they're super
lightweight. Like you can actually just
lightweight. Like you can actually just
go read the header files like
go read the header files like
Yeah, that to me is less of a dependency
Yeah, that to me is less of a dependency
than just having someone's code as
than just having someone's code as
reference, right?
reference, right?
Just fix for loops in Python. Yes,
Just fix for loops in Python. Yes,
there's not really a way to fix for
there's not really a way to fix for
loops in Python. Like,
do you see every do you see? If you go
do you see every do you see? If you go
look at the Python C API, you'll see how
look at the Python C API, you'll see how
much happens every time you do any
much happens every time you do any
operation in Python at all.
operation in Python at all.
It's just always going to be slow.
Like literally every single thing every
Like literally every single thing every
variable no matter what it is gets
variable no matter what it is gets
wrapped in like a big pi object where
wrapped in like a big pi object where
like everything is abstracted so that
like everything is abstracted so that
everything can be type independent. So
everything can be type independent. So
you have you know your dynamically it's
you have you know your dynamically it's
just a mess.
And oh and then one of my big pet peeves
And oh and then one of my big pet peeves
is like people try to like reintroduce
is like people try to like reintroduce
types into Python. Freaking hate type
types into Python. Freaking hate type
Python typins.
Python typins.
That drives me nuts.
That drives me nuts.
That just doesn't work. People keep
That just doesn't work. People keep
trying to PR like types into puffer lab
trying to PR like types into puffer lab
as well and just no I'm not doing it.

You can't make me

If you want
If you want
I feel similarly about like I feel
I feel similarly about like I feel
similarly about TypeScript and
similarly about TypeScript and
JavaScript. Just use JavaScript.

Yeah. I don't like TypeScript at all.
Yeah. I don't like TypeScript at all.
Think about like how how sick how sick
Think about like how how sick how sick
in the head would you have to be to come
in the head would you have to be to come
up with an idea like TypeScript? We're
up with an idea like TypeScript? We're
going to have a language that compiles
going to have a language that compiles
to JavaScript. Yes. Which is a like

me as well. It's like there are certain

people I know who have built impressive
people I know who have built impressive
things but just have a very very high
things but just have a very very high
density of just horrendous engineering
density of just horrendous engineering
takes. So it's like yeah you built the

thing it took you five times as long and
thing it took you five times as long and
the code was 10 times as complex. You
the code was 10 times as complex. You
did build the thing. So, you know,

you're smart, but you've kind of nerd or
you're smart, but you've kind of nerd or
sniped yourself into a way of building

I think the difference between people
I think the difference between people
who end up doing that and people who
who end up doing that and people who
really avoid doing that is people who
really avoid doing that is people who
are really trying to get things done as
are really trying to get things done as

trying to get the actual thing done as
trying to get the actual thing done as
simply as possible and as fast as

it's the thing is simple is not easy

The way I have it set up is I have a
The way I have it set up is I have a

The so the reason here is we do
The so the reason here is we do
algorithm research. Right.
algorithm research. Right.
Right. Okay.
Right. Okay.
So when we're doing algorithm research
So when we're doing algorithm research
like we need to be able to run stuff on

tons of different environments.
tons of different environments.
Right.
Right.
Because like there's hold the algorithm

Yeah.
Yeah.
Right. So like being able to quickly and

simply test the current thing, whatever

Yeah. Like keeping it modular like that.
Yeah. Like keeping it modular like that.
Yeah. So I don't like it. I don't like
Yeah. So I don't like it. I don't like
it either. Um we've tried like just pure
it either. Um we've tried like just pure
dictionaries before. The any files have
dictionaries before. The any files have
just been better for us.
just been better for us.
Okay.
Okay.
There's also like
we have it such that there's like a
we have it such that there's like a
default file and then anything you put
default file and then anything you put
in the ins just goes on top of the
in the ins just goes on top of the
defaults as well. So it's like most of
defaults as well. So it's like most of
the time you just need a stub.

Yeah. I don't know. Maybe it'll maybe we

Yeah.
Uh have you guys ever thought of getting

you're what you're about to do. Like for
you're what you're about to do. Like for
example like oh like you get a bounding

want to hit a target

Yeah.
We're going to do that. It'll be fine

just take the state from C and then in

that's why enterprises use attraction.
It's bad. It like I don't care what the
It's bad. It like I don't care what the

in RL it's especially bad.
Like they write broken they write code
Like they write broken they write code
in a way that it's going to break for

the purpose of testing it.
Like literally one of the most common
Like literally one of the most common
things that I do when I'm working on new
things that I do when I'm working on new
stuff in a rail where I have a big repo
stuff in a rail where I have a big repo
that's like just a mess is I take all
that's like just a mess is I take all
the files, I paste all the files
the files, I paste all the files
together, and then I just start deleting
together, and then I just start deleting
redundant bits recursively. And usually
redundant bits recursively. And usually
I end up with like a tenth of the code
I end up with like a tenth of the code
that I start with cuz it's just all
that I start with cuz it's just all
crap.
We were gonna actually do drone stuff
We were gonna actually do drone stuff
today, right?
Uh, my notifications are blowing up.
Okay. The general guy is here.

I think that was at least 100 followers
I think that was at least 100 followers
in in one stream, which is kind of

crazy. Yeah, it was uh I mean a week ago
we were at
we were at
I
I
think 8,000 something.
think 8,000 something.
Yeah,
Yeah,
it's going to bring a lot of new people
it's going to bring a lot of new people
to RL.
to RL.
We need help with this stuff, man. Like
We need help with this stuff, man. Like
we definitely need help with this stuff.
we definitely need help with this stuff.
We're going to eventually need people
We're going to eventually need people
who can help on the side at some point
who can help on the side at some point
or at least people who can help with the
or at least people who can help with the
other stuff I'm currently doing so I
other stuff I'm currently doing so I
have more time to do outgo stuff. But uh
have more time to do outgo stuff. But uh
yeah, I like I'm realistically in order
yeah, I like I'm realistically in order
to make RLB where it needs to be, I'm
to make RLB where it needs to be, I'm
gonna have to do a whole bunch of
gonna have to do a whole bunch of
algorithm side work. But like for Puffer
algorithm side work. But like for Puffer
to be where Puffer needs to be, I need
to be where Puffer needs to be, I need
to kind of make some solid applications
to kind of make some solid applications
of this first.
of this first.
So that's what I'm doing at the moment.
So that's what I'm doing at the moment.
Yeah, very say like we are going to get
Yeah, very say like we are going to get
some research benefits out of all these
some research benefits out of all these
applications as well, right? But it's
applications as well, right? But it's
the thing that we're not going to get is
the thing that we're not going to get is
like the core
like the core
the core algorithm uh work. That stuff
the core algorithm uh work. That stuff
is
is
usually much better done in isolation.
usually much better done in isolation.
What's the other stuff? If you look at
What's the other stuff? If you look at
um the guide that I posted today, the RL
um the guide that I posted today, the RL
guide,
guide,
sample efficiency is a big question
sample efficiency is a big question
right now and it's probably the most
right now and it's probably the most
covered topic in reinforcement learning,
covered topic in reinforcement learning,
but the coverage is all really bad. So
but the coverage is all really bad. So
essentially there are minimum of three
essentially there are minimum of three
competing ideas on how to do sample
competing ideas on how to do sample
efficient learning and it is unclear
efficient learning and it is unclear
uh to what capac like to what extent any
uh to what capac like to what extent any
of them work if they work how they work
of them work if they work how they work
why they work it's off policy learning
why they work it's off policy learning
is one model based is another search is
is one model based is another search is
another there probably some others that
another there probably some others that
I haven't even thought of in there
it's a whole mess
If I had to guess, I think it's like
If I had to guess, I think it's like
it might even end up being problem
it might even end up being problem
dependent, frankly. I don't know.
But we I think even with the stuff we
But we I think even with the stuff we
have now, we can solve like we can solve
have now, we can solve like we can solve
really like important problems in a ton
really like important problems in a ton
of areas with what we have right now.
Are these algorithms that currently
Are these algorithms that currently
exist or new new ones to be discovered?
exist or new new ones to be discovered?
So, what it probably is, frankly, it's
So, what it probably is, frankly, it's
going to look like me going through the
going to look like me going through the
last seven years worth of deep mind
last seven years worth of deep mind
research. Uh, ripping out all the fancy
research. Uh, ripping out all the fancy
bits that make the algorithms seem cool
bits that make the algorithms seem cool
and keeping the bits that actually make
and keeping the bits that actually make
the algorithms work and then running
the algorithms work and then running
tens of thousands of experiments to test
tens of thousands of experiments to test
all that. That's basically what I did on
all that. That's basically what I did on
PO for uh the 3 release that made it
PO for uh the 3 release that made it
work. It's going to be that at much
work. It's going to be that at much
larger scale though.

in RL. Uh we just don't use deep models
in RL. Uh we just don't use deep models
almost ever because they don't work and
almost ever because they don't work and
we don't really know why in general.
To be fair, we also know that we don't
To be fair, we also know that we don't
actually need deep models to solve
actually need deep models to solve
ludicrously complex problems in
ludicrously complex problems in
reinforcement learning. And I think

that's also unclear, right? Like shallow
that's also unclear, right? Like shallow
models kind of don't work in other areas

like to solve perception tasks for

ridiculously hard problems in RL.
Wait, did Yaxine post like 10 times
Wait, did Yaxine post like 10 times
while we were having that conversation?
I think he did.
Oh, no. Okay, he's been That's all since
Oh, no. Okay, he's been That's all since
then. Holy.
That's funny.
Cool. We don't use deep models because
Cool. We don't use deep models because
too many local solutions.

Local optima don't really exist.
Local optima don't really exist.
Uh they do exist in problem space for
Uh they do exist in problem space for
reinforcement learning because it's a

low dimensional problem, but that is
low dimensional problem, but that is
independent of the architecture used.
That's the technical explanation of
That's the technical explanation of
that.
Uh, I think he wants feedback on that
Uh, I think he wants feedback on that
PR, but we're going to do drum stuff.
Finn, Sam, are you still here?
Uh, yeah, I'm still around. I think Sam
Uh, yeah, I'm still around. I think Sam
will be, I don't know, maybe 45 minutes
will be, I don't know, maybe 45 minutes
and he'll be back.
and he'll be back.
Yeah, I know. we sort of got
Yeah, I know. we sort of got
sidetracked, but uh
sidetracked, but uh
that was a cool conversation and I think
that was a cool conversation and I think
a lot of people will get interested in
a lot of people will get interested in
uh some of the stuff we're working on
uh some of the stuff we're working on
from that. So, hey, maybe we'll even
from that. So, hey, maybe we'll even
have more people helping out with this
have more people helping out with this
stuff.
stuff.
Yeah,
Yeah,
I guess one of the things I should say
I guess one of the things I should say
in case we have new people here is if
in case we have new people here is if
you have experience in another field, uh
you have experience in another field, uh
that's also really helpful with RL
that's also really helpful with RL
because we're looking for all sorts of
because we're looking for all sorts of
problems in different fields uh where
problems in different fields uh where
people just kind of haven't thought of
people just kind of haven't thought of
building sims and trying RL. We built
building sims and trying RL. We built
lots of sims.
lots of sims.
Okay. So, the thing that I was going to
Okay. So, the thing that I was going to
tell you guys on the drone stuff is
tell you guys on the drone stuff is
if we just make every problem some form
if we just make every problem some form
of go to target, that should at the very
of go to target, that should at the very
least cover the rings, like the ring
least cover the rings, like the ring
task and the um all like the flag tasks
task and the um all like the flag tasks
and other things. So, what do you guys
and other things. So, what do you guys
think if I make one big sim with that
think if I make one big sim with that
where I try to keep the complexity as
where I try to keep the complexity as
low as possible? I have like the drone
low as possible? I have like the drone
stuff independent and it basically you
stuff independent and it basically you
can just load in different tasks, right?
can just load in different tasks, right?
So like you have an end that can put
So like you have an end that can put
rings, it can put targets or whatever
rings, it can put targets or whatever
and we just try to do that.
and we just try to do that.
Yeah, that sounds good. It'd be it'd be
Yeah, that sounds good. It'd be it'd be
a lot better than having 10 environments
a lot better than having 10 environments
with marginally different tasks. That
with marginally different tasks. That
wouldn't be great.
wouldn't be great.
Environments. Yeah.
Environments. Yeah.
Well, I don't always know, right?
Well, I don't always know, right?
Sometimes it is better to just have
Sometimes it is better to just have
separate stuff, but I'm thinking like do
separate stuff, but I'm thinking like do
we just get better
we just get better
better results out of um
better results out of um
training on more different stuff or
training on more different stuff or
should we like only train on racising?
should we like only train on racising?
I see. Uh
I see. Uh
yeah, I don't know. That could be cool.
yeah, I don't know. That could be cool.
It's usually the case that like when you
It's usually the case that like when you
have a few different tasks, it is
have a few different tasks, it is
initially harder than one task. Um, but
initially harder than one task. Um, but
then when you get like more and more
then when you get like more and more
training diversity, it actually makes it
training diversity, it actually makes it
easier. So the best number of tasks to
easier. So the best number of tasks to
train on is either one or as many as
train on is either one or as many as
possible,
possible,
right?
right?
If that makes sense.
If that makes sense.
That's usually how our like curriculum
That's usually how our like curriculum
learning RL works,
right? It's kind of like, you know, if
right? It's kind of like, you know, if
you just try to like learn to enough of
you just try to like learn to enough of
a field to solve one problem, for
a field to solve one problem, for
instance, that's generally pretty
instance, that's generally pretty
doable. Uh or if you try to like if you
doable. Uh or if you try to like if you
want to solve like five problems, then
want to solve like five problems, then
you're better off. You just got to learn
you're better off. You just got to learn
the field, right? It's it's one of
the field, right? It's it's one of
those.
those.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
In terms of the the sim to real stuff.
In terms of the the sim to real stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um me and Sam are we're a little bit
Um me and Sam are we're a little bit
busy for sort of like the next two
busy for sort of like the next two
weeks, but then after that we've got
weeks, but then after that we've got
like an entire month of just nothing. So
like an entire month of just nothing. So
most of the stuff will probably be done
most of the stuff will probably be done
in sort of late July, August.
in sort of late July, August.
Um, but there's there's a bunch of uh
Um, but there's there's a bunch of uh
physics stuff to be added until then.
physics stuff to be added until then.
Should still be busy.
Should still be busy.
Yeah. I mean, I'm going to try to get
Yeah. I mean, I'm going to try to get
like some really solid Sims and then
like some really solid Sims and then
it's just a question of how hard is it
it's just a question of how hard is it
to throw on the hardware. I mean, it's
to throw on the hardware. I mean, it's
it might be the case that we just throw
it might be the case that we just throw
the commands on the hardware and it
the commands on the hardware and it
works. Uh, I don't know. The perception
works. Uh, I don't know. The perception
stuff is going to be a little different.
stuff is going to be a little different.
Uh, I'm probably going to have to get
Uh, I'm probably going to have to get
myself a drone kit as well to help work
myself a drone kit as well to help work
on that because we do need to do state
on that because we do need to do state
estimation of some type, right?
estimation of some type, right?
Uh, there was a paper I read from Zurich
Uh, there was a paper I read from Zurich
where they just use the camera, but but
where they just use the camera, but but
yeah, state estimation probably not
yeah, state estimation probably not
hurt.
hurt.
Well, if you learn end to end with the
Well, if you learn end to end with the
camera again, your training gets a
camera again, your training gets a
thousandx slower.
thousandx slower.
Yeah. Yeah. Right.
Yeah. Yeah. Right.
So, that's just not fun ideally.
trying to think like what's the simplest
trying to think like what's the simplest
thing we could throw together to make uh
thing we could throw together to make uh
to make it work initially. It's probably
to make it work initially. It's probably
just like the hoops or whatever because
just like the hoops or whatever because
the hoops are almost like QR codes,
the hoops are almost like QR codes,
right? It's kind of like an offtheshelf
right? It's kind of like an offtheshelf
offtheshelf thing.
offtheshelf thing.
Mhm.
Mhm.
I don't know how you get like distance
I don't know how you get like distance
to those though from K like it does a
to those though from K like it does a
depth. It's like a depth estimation as
depth. It's like a depth estimation as
well, isn't it?
well, isn't it?
Yeah. Hello. I'm back.
Yeah. Hello. I'm back.
Where's
Where's
this
this
with the drone stuff? Like
with the drone stuff? Like
I think so I can get us one sim that
I think so I can get us one sim that
does this forming and does your stuff
does this forming and does your stuff
and it'll be really easy to load
and it'll be really easy to load
specific tasks in or to train all the
specific tasks in or to train all the
different tasks. like I can get a full
different tasks. like I can get a full
demos out of that for sure. Now the
demos out of that for sure. Now the
question is going to be to get it on the
question is going to be to get it on the
real hardware right there two things
real hardware right there two things
right there to real gap and then there's
right there to real gap and then there's
the perception part to actually estimate
the perception part to actually estimate
state.
state.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I I think the the latter would probably
I I think the the latter would probably
be the more difficult part but I'm not
be the more difficult part but I'm not
sure
sure
the state estimation.
the state estimation.
Uh yeah.
Uh yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,
I mean,
what's like the most basic thing we can
what's like the most basic thing we can
do for that?
I mean,
I mean,
just
a drone kit you're using. Is it possible
a drone kit you're using. Is it possible
to 3D print drones?
to 3D print drones?
Order a bunch of batteries? You need
Order a bunch of batteries? You need
motors and cameras and sensors and like
motors and cameras and sensors and like
you need chips. The only thing you can
you need chips. The only thing you can
print is a frame.
print is a frame.
A frame isn't even expensive. Like at
A frame isn't even expensive. Like at
that point, you're just you're just
that point, you're just you're just
causing yourself a whole bunch of
causing yourself a whole bunch of
assembly work or uh not saving really
assembly work or uh not saving really
any money or anything. The only reason
any money or anything. The only reason
we would like 3D print stuff is if we
we would like 3D print stuff is if we
wanted to play with different form
wanted to play with different form
factors or something.
factors or something.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Yeah.
Basic estimation.
There was there was that paper you sent
There was there was that paper you sent
me this morning as well, Finn. The It
me this morning as well, Finn. The It
was from Zurich again. What was that?
was from Zurich again. What was that?
Uh what? The champion level drone racing
Uh what? The champion level drone racing

No, the the first one. The
No, the the first one. The
Oh, yeah. The perception only one.
Oh, yeah. The perception only one.
Yeah, that seemed pretty cool.
Yeah, that seemed pretty cool.
I mean, if we could
I mean, if we could
It's so hard. Like getting that sim to
It's so hard. Like getting that sim to
real is way harder, I would think,
real is way harder, I would think,
is the annoying bit because like
is the annoying bit because like
when they do that in robotics,
when they do that in robotics,
right, they like
right, they like
They have a pretty clean deployment
They have a pretty clean deployment
setup for it. There's not really a bunch
setup for it. There's not really a bunch
of visual noise
of visual noise
getting a sim to real when like you have
getting a sim to real when like you have
a realistic moving background and such.
a realistic moving background and such.
That's
That's
Yeah,
Yeah,
I think that's going to be pretty
I think that's going to be pretty
obnoxious.
obnoxious.
It's not even either.
It's not even either.
Ideally, you just segment the the image,
Ideally, you just segment the the image,
right? And then it's kind of doesn't
right? And then it's kind of doesn't
really matter what the background is.
I mean, you can do that.
I mean, you can do that.
You really want to just know where
You really want to just know where
you want to know where the target is.
you want to know where the target is.
Like then at that point, you're not
Like then at that point, you're not
really doing you're not doing state
really doing you're not doing state
estimation at all. You're doing end to
estimation at all. You're doing end to
end.
end.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The only way we could do that, right,
The only way we could do that, right,
it's it makes the project much more
it's it makes the project much more
complicated. It's thing I was telling a
complicated. It's thing I was telling a
which is the batch renderer.
which is the batch renderer.
It makes it a lot more complicated.
It makes it a lot more complicated.
I think my preference here would be
I think my preference here would be
is there like a really basic state
is there like a really basic state
estimation thing that we can do to get
estimation thing that we can do to get
something to work first?
something to work first?
Uh yes is uh let me see what
Uh yes is uh let me see what
I mean isn't best case scenario
I mean isn't best case scenario
it the kind of
it the kind of
sim to real gap is so small that it
sim to real gap is so small that it
doesn't really matter but I think that's
doesn't really matter but I think that's
kind of
kind of
it's not the sim to real gap issue right
it's not the sim to real gap issue right
it's the state estimation problem
it's the state estimation problem
so you need to know where the targets
so you need to know where the targets
are right we're training on like the
are right we're training on like the
target
target
you need to know where the target is if
you need to know where the target is if
you instrument the targets. It's easy,
you instrument the targets. It's easy,
but that's cheating. Now, you can
but that's cheating. Now, you can
actually when we doing
actually when we doing
I was thinking of something else.
I was thinking of something else.
We actually like the flag demo for stuff
We actually like the flag demo for stuff
for instance, like that stuff, we can
for instance, like that stuff, we can
actually just cheat because
actually just cheat because
all we really need to know is where all
all we really need to know is where all
the drones are
the drones are
and they're allowed to talk to each
and they're allowed to talk to each
other, right? That's not cheating.
other, right? That's not cheating.
They're all your drones.
They're all your drones.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, the the kind of
Well, the the kind of
I suppose easy but very expensive way
I suppose easy but very expensive way
they they did it before. Did they did
they they did it before. Did they did
they not just have like 50 cameras in
they not just have like 50 cameras in
the room where they were?
the room where they were?
Yeah, one of their papers did, which is
Yeah, one of their papers did, which is
kind of kind of crazy.
kind of kind of crazy.
Just had like a massive warehouse filled
Just had like a massive warehouse filled
with cameras and the hoops and stuff and
with cameras and the hoops and stuff and
it could just track them.
it could just track them.
Yeah, that's super cheaty though. like
Yeah, that's super cheaty though. like
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's not going to work anywhere else.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. It's kind of a bit silly really.
Yeah. It's kind of a bit silly really.
I think accelerometer is probably the
I think accelerometer is probably the
way to go.
way to go.
I think 65 crypto.
I mean, at that point, you just like
I mean, at that point, you just like
record the positions of,
record the positions of,
you know, all the targets and just give
you know, all the targets and just give
it to the drone, right? Like there's no
it to the drone, right? Like there's no
reason to even have any perception.
Yeah,
Yeah,
we could. Well, you don't know your
we could. Well, you don't know your
absolute position is the annoying bit,
absolute position is the annoying bit,
right?
right?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You can like
You can like
you have to integrate from your starting
you have to integrate from your starting
position. And I'm pretty sure that type
position. And I'm pretty sure that type
of stuff is like really noisy, right?
of stuff is like really noisy, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
If you just like double integral your
If you just like double integral your
acceleration, it's really noisy.
That that's what you were trying for
That that's what you were trying for
our like original drone before we had
our like original drone before we had
the the new one and it just didn't work
the the new one and it just didn't work
at all.
at all.
Drone communication might be cheating if
Drone communication might be cheating if
you consider somebody might be trying to
you consider somebody might be trying to
interrupt the signal.
interrupt the signal.
Um I don't know like
Um I don't know like
How many things are there? I guess
How many things are there? I guess
technically they can jam the radar
technically they can jam the radar
without like impeding the drone
without like impeding the drone
if you want to think of it that way. So
if you want to think of it that way. So
you can interrupt communication and
you can interrupt communication and
still leave it online. I guess
still leave it online. I guess
technically
state the state estimation thing is
state the state estimation thing is
is tough.
I really don't want to do the the batch
I really don't want to do the the batch
render thing just on our own, you know?
render thing just on our own, you know?
Like I don't want to just like do the
Like I don't want to just like do the
batch render to make a cool demo work,
batch render to make a cool demo work,
right? Like the batch render thing is if
right? Like the batch render thing is if
we want to do perception based stuff

that will be part of a larger project in
that will be part of a larger project in
my mind.

Okay,
Okay,
depth camera. Yeah, we can get like a
depth camera. Yeah, we can get like a
depth sensor I guess. But I don't know
depth sensor I guess. But I don't know
how well that works cuz like okay, you
how well that works cuz like okay, you
have a camera and let's say you're
have a camera and let's say you're
basically doing QR code stuff that's off
basically doing QR code stuff that's off
the shelf, right? because it's

the targets.
They are painted with something so you
They are painted with something so you
can recognize them. That's pretty
can recognize them. That's pretty
standard,
you know. Um, ages ago, Finn, that like
you know. Um, ages ago, Finn, that like

running on his laptop.

Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
How many frames per second was that?

Uh, not enough.

Not enough. Okay.
Not enough. Okay.
I think it I mean on our computers,

Okay.
Okay.
There are there are faster ones, but
There are there are faster ones, but
Oh, you mean like the camera based

Yeah, I've worked on that before. That's
Yeah, I've worked on that before. That's
that's way too slow.
that's way too slow.
I mean, tech like I maybe if you really

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.
I think um I sent

Sorry, go on.
Sorry, go on.
I was just going to say I'll put a

Actually send about how they do their

Is it like super complicated?
Is it like super complicated?
Yeah. I mean it's complicated enough but
Yeah. I mean it's complicated enough but
it would be
it would be
great bit of a pain.
great bit of a pain.
I'm saying image.
I'm saying image.
It's probably
It's probably
I mean we've kind of got to get it
I mean we've kind of got to get it
working on like
working on like
is it strings before we
is it strings before we
Yeah, that is because it's trained
Yeah, that is because it's trained
right. It's like they're they're kind of
right. It's like they're they're kind of
just putting this calman filter. Yeah.
just putting this calman filter. Yeah.
So they're training on
So they're training on
essentially down sampled images. This is
essentially down sampled images. This is
basically the same thing as what if we
basically the same thing as what if we
just train on images with some
just train on images with some
pre-processing. So that's super slow.
pre-processing. So that's super slow.
That's not That's not exactly state
That's not That's not exactly state
estimation,
right?
right?
Yeah.
Is there if we instrument the things, is
Is there if we instrument the things, is
there like a uh
there like a uh
how hard is it to get a like a a
how hard is it to get a like a a
proximity sensor that gives you a
proximity sensor that gives you a
reliable estimate of how far you are
reliable estimate of how far you are
away from another sensor?
away from another sensor?
How was it done?
How was it done?
I I don't think it's exactly the same
I I don't think it's exactly the same
thing, but um they used a
thing, but um they used a
uh it was on the the drone websites when
uh it was on the the drone websites when
we were buying the parts. It's called
we were buying the parts. It's called
the Intel Real Sense camera. Uh, and
the Intel Real Sense camera. Uh, and
then they just like had that connected
then they just like had that connected
to some onboard
to some onboard
compute thing.
compute thing.
Uh, I I think it's basically just a kind
Uh, I I think it's basically just a kind
of an infrared based
of an infrared based
um depth sensor pretty much.
infrared base depth sensor.
Well, you need to also know that you're
Well, you need to also know that you're
looking at the targets.
looking at the targets.
Yeah,
but I I got the gist that going down the
but I I got the gist that going down the
the route of these Intel cameras means
the route of these Intel cameras means
you'd need to buy one of those kind of
you'd need to buy one of those kind of
Nvidia compute modules as well. And it's
Nvidia compute modules as well. And it's
just a a very expensive rabbit hole.
just a a very expensive rabbit hole.
You know, initially guys, we could just
You know, initially guys, we could just
punt on it for now and just be like,
punt on it for now and just be like,
"Hey, let's get the thing to run on the
"Hey, let's get the thing to run on the
real drone." Um, we have relative
real drone." Um, we have relative
we have relative targeting, right?
we have relative targeting, right?
So, what we could do
So, what we could do
is we could just make a thing, right,
is we could just make a thing, right,
where on your laptop, you can drag
where on your laptop, you can drag
around the target or whatever
around the target or whatever
and it'll just go to that
and it'll just go to that
because you basically you tell it, "All
because you basically you tell it, "All
right, the target's this far away."
right, the target's this far away."
Um,
Um,
you just do the basic integral or
you just do the basic integral or
whatever. It doesn't collapse because it
whatever. It doesn't collapse because it
gets reset every target.
gets reset every target.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So then like that should basically let
So then like that should basically let
you control the drone and it should be
you control the drone and it should be
able to go from like its current
able to go from like its current
position to any other position pretty
position to any other position pretty
easily. And like we can already start
easily. And like we can already start
throwing together some demos before we
throwing together some demos before we
have to do perception. Like my highest
have to do perception. Like my highest
priority here is to just get get the
priority here is to just get get the
neural net running on the drone in a way
neural net running on the drone in a way
that it's actually flying correctly,
that it's actually flying correctly,
right? Like the perception thing is kind
right? Like the perception thing is kind
of whatever. Like in my mind, this is
of whatever. Like in my mind, this is
this is like all the application
this is like all the application
specific crap, right? Like I think that
specific crap, right? Like I think that
even before we touch perception, we
even before we touch perception, we
should be able to come up with something
should be able to come up with something
cool enough
Like yeah, like what if we just give it
Like yeah, like what if we just give it
the
the
if we just like give it the course for
if we just like give it the course for
instance, right? Like literally just run
instance, right? Like literally just run
the exact policy. It's going to do all
the exact policy. It's going to do all
sorts of cool aerial maneuvers, isn't
sorts of cool aerial maneuvers, isn't
it?
it?
Mhm. You'd hope so. Yeah, that would be
Mhm. You'd hope so. Yeah, that would be
I'm pretty sure for these drone racing
I'm pretty sure for these drone racing
things, their their policy is literally
things, their their policy is literally
just on that one course anyway. So at
just on that one course anyway. So at
least then we know that we're at least
least then we know that we're at least
as good as
as good as
as the current best is
as the current best is
well depending on how what the gap is
well depending on how what the gap is
like what you could do is you could just
like what you could do is you could just
like set it up and measure right like
like set it up and measure right like
put a couple of hoops around no
put a couple of hoops around no
instrumentation no perception and like
instrumentation no perception and like
if the thing is accurate it'll just fly
if the thing is accurate it'll just fly
through them if they're in the same
through them if they're in the same
position as it thinks. I'm sure that the
position as it thinks. I'm sure that the
like it'll diverge eventually, but
like it'll diverge eventually, but
my priority here is I don't want to make
my priority here is I don't want to make
you guys do a bunch of boring ass
you guys do a bunch of boring ass
annoying perception work. Like the goal
annoying perception work. Like the goal
is to get something cool running on the
is to get something cool running on the
bot as quickly as possible. I think
bot as quickly as possible. I think
that'll be way more interesting for you
that'll be way more interesting for you
and that'll already make like a really
and that'll already make like a really
cool demo because you'll get like just
cool demo because you'll get like just
flying the horse in midair will get you
flying the horse in midair will get you
all sorts of like interesting aerial
all sorts of like interesting aerial
maneuvers, right?
maneuvers, right?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I think that that
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I think that that
should be really cool. And then once we
should be really cool. And then once we
once we've got some cool stuff, then we
once we've got some cool stuff, then we
could we'll know if we need well what to
could we'll know if we need well what to
what level we need perception.
what level we need perception.
I almost wonder well this probably be a
I almost wonder well this probably be a
pain in the ass if you can just like
pain in the ass if you can just like
throw some AR goggles on and like see
throw some AR goggles on and like see
the course like have it like run an AR
the course like have it like run an AR
course so we don't have to actually
course so we don't have to actually
Right.
Right.
Yeah,
Yeah,
that would be kind of cool.
Well, we've we've kind of got a a good
Well, we've we've kind of got a a good
controlled environment to do the the
controlled environment to do the the
drone in because we've um like booked
drone in because we've um like booked
out the exam hall basically which is
out the exam hall basically which is
like 500 person capacity. So, we've got
like 500 person capacity. So, we've got
a massive hall to fly around in at
a massive hall to fly around in at
speed.
speed.
So, we can probably
So, we can probably
probably even like stream some of it
probably even like stream some of it
from from our phone or something just so
from from our phone or something just so
that be awesome. You guys can see
infrared probably won't work due to
infrared probably won't work due to
distance constraints. Maybe more LAR.
distance constraints. Maybe more LAR.
Yeah, we don't want to really get into
Yeah, we don't want to really get into
that crap before we can avoid it, right?
that crap before we can avoid it, right?
Like
Like
that sounds cheap.
that sounds cheap.
The goal of um
The goal of um
the goal of a lot of what we're doing is
the goal of a lot of what we're doing is
to really showcase the tech and then
to really showcase the tech and then
like application specific tie-ins to
like application specific tie-ins to
tech. We can do that as part of like
tech. We can do that as part of like
formal engagements with companies and
formal engagements with companies and
clients and stuff, right? We want to the
clients and stuff, right? We want to the
core stuff that we do on our own is
core stuff that we do on our own is
mainly like keep it as we want to like
mainly like keep it as we want to like
show off as many cool things as we can
show off as many cool things as we can
that are like close to the tech. And I
that are like close to the tech. And I
think this is this qualifies because
think this is this qualifies because
this will be simil
this will be simil
this this is sim real like flying the
this this is sim real like flying the
course in the air. Um
course in the air. Um
the perception is a completely
the perception is a completely
independent problem, right?
independent problem, right?
It's a problem we know how to solve if
It's a problem we know how to solve if
we had to, right? There are two
we had to, right? There are two
different approaches. There's state
different approaches. There's state
estimation. It's literally been done
estimation. It's literally been done
already, right? It's just annoying.
already, right? It's just annoying.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh and then there is like hyper batch
Uh and then there is like hyper batch
simulation, right? It's hyper hyperfast
simulation, right? It's hyper hyperfast
sim for uh camera. That's like another
sim for uh camera. That's like another
thing you can do.
Yeah.
It shouldn't even be that crazy
It shouldn't even be that crazy
expensive I would think for something
expensive I would think for something
like this.
like this.
Like Madrona, you probably with Madrona
Like Madrona, you probably with Madrona
you could get a couple hundred thousand
you could get a couple hundred thousand
frames per second in order to scale
frames per second in order to scale
GPUs, but like we literally don't need
GPUs, but like we literally don't need
to do that initially at all. It's just
to do that initially at all. It's just
like get the drones running around doing
like get the drones running around doing
all sorts of crazy stuff autonomously.
all sorts of crazy stuff autonomously.
Could
Could
you find a USB A to A cable Finn or
you find a USB A to A cable Finn or
shall I uh
shall I uh
get one ready to
get one ready to
I mean I can look in like 10 minutes
I mean I can look in like 10 minutes
sure.
sure.
Okay.
Okay.
I think I've got one.
I think I've got one.
I think that's the the last thing we'll
I think that's the the last thing we'll
need.
need.
Oh. Um are we we still don't really need
Oh. Um are we we still don't really need
to get video back from the the drone's
to get video back from the the drone's
camera yet, do we? cuz that was the kind
camera yet, do we? cuz that was the kind
of the component we skipped out last
of the component we skipped out last
time because there was no no stuff I
time because there was no no stuff I
think when I looked the other day at the
think when I looked the other day at the
moment.
moment.
Yeah,
Yeah,
I think if you guys can just get and
I think if you guys can just get and
this way it's not going to take months
this way it's not going to take months
as well. I think if you guys can just
as well. I think if you guys can just
like can we run the code on the drone?
like can we run the code on the drone?
Can we get it to fly around and do like
Can we get it to fly around and do like
what looks like running the course? Just
what looks like running the course? Just
like watch on your basically just if you
like watch on your basically just if you
can see on your laptop like this is what
can see on your laptop like this is what
it thinks in the sim, right? Right. And
it thinks in the sim, right? Right. And
then you can like physically look at
then you can like physically look at
what the drone is doing and see that
what the drone is doing and see that
they're it like looks like they're doing
they're it like looks like they're doing
the same stuff, right?
the same stuff, right?
Yeah. Yeah, that would be really cool.
Yeah. Yeah, that would be really cool.
You can quantify.
You can quantify.
I'm hoping we can
I'm hoping we can
we can well hopefully we can get the the
we can well hopefully we can get the the
model running on the drone like kind of
model running on the drone like kind of
same day. I'm hoping kind of the actual
same day. I'm hoping kind of the actual
hardware part of it shouldn't be too
hardware part of it shouldn't be too
bad. Um, and all of this drone firmware
bad. Um, and all of this drone firmware
plays nicely, but we'll see.
plays nicely, but we'll see.
Yeah, askine about the there's like the
Yeah, askine about the there's like the
general software that's used for a lot
general software that's used for a lot
of things. He's played with that before,
of things. He's played with that before,
I think, from different on different
I think, from different on different
problems.
problems.
We may have to mess around with what the
We may have to mess around with what the
actions look like.
actions look like.
I don't know how nicely the drone will
I don't know how nicely the drone will
play with just giving it RPM commands,
play with just giving it RPM commands,
but
but
what do you usually give it? It sounded
what do you usually give it? It sounded
like you can do that, but
like you can do that, but
yeah,
yeah,
it's a bit
it's a bit
slightly less standard.
slightly less standard.
Yeah.
But either way, it should be fine.
But either way, it should be fine.
Yeah. I'm just That's the thing I'm kind
Yeah. I'm just That's the thing I'm kind
of slightly worried about because when
of slightly worried about because when
we were doing it
we were doing it
uh with the old drone, simply just
uh with the old drone, simply just
sending commands to the drone
sending commands to the drone
programmatically was pretty difficult.
programmatically was pretty difficult.
just
just
Yeah. So, the hope is that it's not with
Yeah. So, the hope is that it's not with
this. And if it is, we'll have to do
this. And if it is, we'll have to do
something else.
At least the hope is that this one at
At least the hope is that this one at
least the hope with this one is that
least the hope with this one is that
it's not going to break in five minutes
it's not going to break in five minutes
at least.
at least.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Like because the the ones they use for
Like because the the ones they use for
racing, they have unshielded
racing, they have unshielded
rotors.
rotors.
So,
So,
like you crash that thing at any speed
like you crash that thing at any speed
once, it's broken.
once, it's broken.
Well, the the the transmitter we got
Well, the the the transmitter we got
this time is kind of um you can just use
this time is kind of um you can just use
with any drone and it sounds like the
with any drone and it sounds like the
transmitter we've got is good and is
transmitter we've got is good and is
also pretty good for sending
also pretty good for sending
programmatic controls. So hopefully as
programmatic controls. So hopefully as
that's kind of the
that's kind of the
the key link this time, the actual drone
the key link this time, the actual drone
shouldn't really matter. It's an Johnny.
The guys are doing pretty well already.
We were looking at that earlier. the the
We were looking at that earlier. the the
list of the list of papers look good. I
list of the list of papers look good. I
need to I need to have a look through
need to I need to have a look through
that and see if there's anything I've
that and see if there's anything I've
missed out on.
missed out on.
What list of papers? Oh, the ones Yeah,
What list of papers? Oh, the ones Yeah,
that's like general
that's like general
there's general RL stuff in there. It's
there's general RL stuff in there. It's
really the best way to know uh
really the best way to know uh
to like learn this stuff. It's not it's
to like learn this stuff. It's not it's
not the uh the material that you'll find
not the uh the material that you'll find
pretty much anywhere else. Also,
pretty much anywhere else. Also,
it's like I have a very different
it's like I have a very different
approach to a lot of this stuff and it's
approach to a lot of this stuff and it's
it's honestly a lot easier like because
it's honestly a lot easier like because
if you have a really strong math
if you have a really strong math
background, like yeah, you'll just be
background, like yeah, you'll just be
fine doing all the formal stuff. But the
fine doing all the formal stuff. But the
thing is,
thing is,
it's not going to tell you how to
it's not going to tell you how to
actually do RL because none of the
actually do RL because none of the
format the formal math actually works.
format the formal math actually works.
And second of all, like if you don't
And second of all, like if you don't
have a really good math background, it's
have a really good math background, it's
going to be really hard and you're still
going to be really hard and you're still
not going to know how RL works. Whereas
not going to know how RL works. Whereas
if you just like are able to if you're
if you just like are able to if you're
able to do the material that I've sent,
able to do the material that I've sent,
like it relies more on programming.
like it relies more on programming.
It's more accessible in a sense because
It's more accessible in a sense because
maybe your code's not as good as mine,
maybe your code's not as good as mine,
but if you stick to the way that I've
but if you stick to the way that I've
suggested you do things, at least it'll
suggested you do things, at least it'll
be passively good. Um, and you'll
be passively good. Um, and you'll
actually get RL working. Like you will
actually get RL working. Like you will
provably have RL working on a new
provably have RL working on a new
problem, a new environment that you've

made, several new environments of
made, several new environments of
increasing complexity that you've made.
increasing complexity that you've made.
Um, and you fill in the theoretical gaps
Um, and you fill in the theoretical gaps
along the way. And the theoretical gaps
along the way. And the theoretical gaps
we're going to fill in aren't even the
we're going to fill in aren't even the
same as the ones in the the formal
same as the ones in the the formal
interest readard for instance because
interest readard for instance because
it's like those are just really old and
it's like those are just really old and
bad models of a lot of problems.
bad models of a lot of problems.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's mostly knowledge of like you know
It's mostly knowledge of like you know
newer more empirical models and what
newer more empirical models and what
they're based on.
Okay, I'm going to get you guys a sim
Okay, I'm going to get you guys a sim
right now. That's going to be the goal.
right now. That's going to be the goal.
Uh I'm going to see if I basically just
Uh I'm going to see if I basically just
merge the drone swarm and the drone
merge the drone swarm and the drone
racing environments.
racing environments.
Yeah, I think that would be good. I kind
Yeah, I think that would be good. I kind
of I really like the way you've done it
of I really like the way you've done it
in
in
the the swarm one at the minute where
the the swarm one at the minute where
you just kind of just switch between
you just kind of just switch between
them. I think if we just go with that,
them. I think if we just go with that,
that would be great. It's a little
that would be great. It's a little
annoying because like the rings are
annoying because like the rings are
going to be task specific
going to be task specific
and I also was going to put like
and I also was going to put like
obstacles at some point. I think it
obstacles at some point. I think it
would be cool to put like obstacles know
would be cool to put like obstacles know
we could just spawn like random spheres
we could just spawn like random spheres
some distance away from uh
some distance away from uh
just in case it's useful. I'll put in my
just in case it's useful. I'll put in my
original like Python
original like Python
uh collisions code in the development
uh collisions code in the development
channel cuz that that supports planes
channel cuz that that supports planes
and um
and um
well planes are hard. Spheres are really
well planes are hard. Spheres are really
easy, right?
easy, right?
It's just a rad,
It's just a rad,
right?
right?
Yeah. I sat and worked out all of the
Yeah. I sat and worked out all of the
linear algebra for it and it does work.
linear algebra for it and it does work.
It's just not very
It's just not very
It's still quadratic. It's annoying on
It's still quadratic. It's annoying on
hard and it I'm not envious of that
hard and it I'm not envious of that
stuff.
Yeah, it took a while.
Yeah, it took a while.
You know, there's not really a great way
You know, there's not really a great way
to do planes. Cubes you can do very
to do planes. Cubes you can do very
easily. Cubes you just do a bounding
easily. Cubes you just do a bounding
sphere, right?
sphere, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it's like pretty close.
the the original kind of plan back at
the the original kind of plan back at
end of last year probably with drone was
end of last year probably with drone was
getting it to kind of navigate
getting it to kind of navigate
um environments and stuff. Uh we've kind
um environments and stuff. Uh we've kind
of switched more over to
of switched more over to
kind of the the race. It was kind of
kind of the the race. It was kind of
more of like an exploring drone before I
more of like an exploring drone before I
suppose.
suppose.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um
Um
we can do that super easily in sim if
we can do that super easily in sim if
you guys want to.
you guys want to.
I mean, think about it. We just add a
I mean, think about it. We just add a
task. It's like get to the objective and
task. It's like get to the objective and
you're basically navigating through an
you're basically navigating through an
asteroid field, right?
asteroid field, right?
Mhm.
Mhm.
The only thing is like the um
The only thing is like the um
we have to change the ops a little bit
we have to change the ops a little bit
because it would be like you'd have to
because it would be like you'd have to
know
know
probably what we should do is there
probably what we should do is there
should just be like a ring buffer and
should just be like a ring buffer and
like a nearest buffer or something. So
like a nearest buffer or something. So
you can see the nearest rings because
you can see the nearest rings because
they have you need to actually know the
they have you need to actually know the
normal direction for those and that's
normal direction for those and that's
needed for racing. But everything else
needed for racing. But everything else
is just like an obstacle buffer. So like
is just like an obstacle buffer. So like
other drones are obstacles. Asteroids
other drones are obstacles. Asteroids
would be like obstacles.
would be like obstacles.
It's just like, "Hey, this is where it
It's just like, "Hey, this is where it
is. This is how big it is. Don't hit
is. This is how big it is. Don't hit
it."
it."
Yeah,
Yeah,
I can do I can get something like that
I can do I can get something like that
working. So then that would be like a
working. So then that would be like a
navigation type thing. Like, you know,
navigation type thing. Like, you know,
get to this bowl on the other side of
get to this bowl on the other side of
the map and don't crash into any of
the map and don't crash into any of
these obstacles.
these obstacles.
Mhm.
Mhm.
Cool.
Cool.
Yeah. I'm I'm looking back at the the
Yeah. I'm I'm looking back at the the
collision code now and there's some
collision code now and there's some
stuff which I'm not fully sure about now
stuff which I'm not fully sure about now
I look at it again because it is six
I look at it again because it is six
month old code but I think it it should
month old code but I think it it should
be all right.
be all right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, the other the other thing we did
Oh, the other the other thing we did
have originally which could be useful
have originally which could be useful
when when and if we do uh perception
when when and if we do uh perception
stuff is we we were able to uh train it
stuff is we we were able to uh train it
to look in a certain direction as well
to look in a certain direction as well
as moving to a a place so the camera is
as moving to a a place so the camera is
kind of facing in the right way.
kind of facing in the right way.
Yeah, that might be useful.
Yeah, that might be useful.
Um, so that I can actually that I'm not
Um, so that I can actually that I'm not
as concerned about because all I would
as concerned about because all I would
have to do for that is I would take the
have to do for that is I would take the
current state based observations and I
current state based observations and I
would make them only appear within a
would make them only appear within a
clone of vision. Right.
clone of vision. Right.
Right. Okay.
Right. Okay.
So, and then it's still the same state
So, and then it's still the same state
estimation problem
estimation problem
as before, right? Like you still have to
as before, right? Like you still have to
just do the state estimation, but then
just do the state estimation, but then
it should basically learn that it has to
it should basically learn that it has to
turn toward stuff to see it
turn toward stuff to see it
automatically.
automatically.
So that's not super hard. That's That's
So that's not super hard. That's That's
true.
true.
I think we we were going We were hoping
I think we we were going We were hoping
were we trying to get it to fly
were we trying to get it to fly
backwards or something? So, I can't
backwards or something? So, I can't
remember.
remember.
It has to spin and it like it takes a
It has to spin and it like it takes a
while to spin. So, it's like
while to spin. So, it's like
Yeah.
Yeah.
getting it to get new information like
getting it to get new information like
that can be a little tricky. Not that
that can be a little tricky. Not that
bad.

Well, hopefully we get a lot of new
Well, hopefully we get a lot of new
people into uh reinforcement learning
people into uh reinforcement learning
with this and I will have to just
with this and I will have to just
work on stuff
work on stuff
getting like work.
getting like work.
Yeah. When it probably be
Yeah. When it probably be
Sorry, go on Finn.
Sorry, go on Finn.
I was just going to ask when did when
I was just going to ask when did when
did you scene find this stuff? Like what
did you scene find this stuff? Like what
what's the what's the story there? When
what's the what's the story there? When

Oh, it was it's one of my other
Oh, it was it's one of my other
followers apparently just like added me
followers apparently just like added me
with Puffer Lib when he cuz like he was
with Puffer Lib when he cuz like he was
trying to do some RL thing. He just hops
trying to do some RL thing. He just hops
around and does a ton of different
around and does a ton of different
things and one of my followers like
things and one of my followers like
said, "Oh yeah, you should check out
said, "Oh yeah, you should check out
Joseph's Puffer Lib stuff."
Joseph's Puffer Lib stuff."
Oh, nice.
Oh, nice.
So, I have I have grassroots marketing.
So, I have I have grassroots marketing.
We just have Puffer Lib. We just have
We just have Puffer Lib. We just have
we have some people that use puffer lip
we have some people that use puffer lip
and they like it apparently. So we're
and they like it apparently. So we're
very happy about that.
very happy about that.
Um puffer lip could be way better than
Um puffer lip could be way better than
it is now though. It can be way way
it is now though. It can be way way
better. Going to do some applications on
better. Going to do some applications on
the current version before I really go
the current version before I really go
back and look at that.
Okay. So,
Okay. So,
I'm going to go use the bathroom and
I'm going to go use the bathroom and
grab coffee real quick and then I'm
grab coffee real quick and then I'm
going to see if I can actually code up
going to see if I can actually code up
the uh the single sim.
the uh the single sim.
I think I should be able to make a
I think I should be able to make a
decent dentonic today. Uh,
technically we could do
technically we could do
I'm going to see if we have like
I'm going to see if we have like
entirely different step functions per
entirely different step functions per
task or what cuz like technically
no I can't I can't actually make the
no I can't I can't actually make the
racing ends multi-agent because the
racing ends multi-agent because the
targets change when the drone goes
targets change when the drone goes
through them. It would be a cool thing
through them. It would be a cool thing
to have like a ton of drones flying the
to have like a ton of drones flying the
course. But
course. But
yeah,
yeah,
I mean, at least because it's PCGed for
I mean, at least because it's PCGed for
now, like if you were to just write if
now, like if you were to just write if
you were to just put all the rings down
you were to just put all the rings down
at the same time, then you could do it.
at the same time, then you could do it.
Well, I mean, we could do that, right?
Well, I mean, we could do that, right?
There's
There's
they are all created at at the start.
they are all created at at the start.
It's like a set
It's like a set
set buffer. If we just put all the rings
set buffer. If we just put all the rings
down and then it just when it resets the
down and then it just when it resets the
whole environment resets the force. Like
whole environment resets the force. Like
I could put all the drones in and just
I could put all the drones in and just
like have them all do the same force at
like have them all do the same force at
the same time.
the same time.
Yeah, it does that already. It just only
Yeah, it does that already. It just only
shows you them one by one or two by two,
shows you them one by one or two by two,
I guess.
I guess.
Okay.
Okay.
Shouldn't be too bad.
Shouldn't be too bad.
You just have to keep track of which
You just have to keep track of which
ring each drone is at. We probably we
ring each drone is at. We probably we
might need to make the map a bit larger
might need to make the map a bit larger
as well cuz like the collision checks
as well cuz like the collision checks
for for everything.
for for everything.
It's 10 by 10.
It's 10 by 10.
I think we we've kind of
I think we we've kind of
Yeah.
Yeah.
We've just got kind of like a
uh the Zurich people.
uh the Zurich people.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um
Um
pretty big. I'm not sure exactly, but
pretty big. I'm not sure exactly, but
bigger than 10 by 10 by 10.
bigger than 10 by 10 by 10.
Yeah,
Yeah,
it's probably like is it like 50 by 50
it's probably like is it like 50 by 50
by 10 or something?
by 10 or something?
I'd imagine so. Yeah.
I'd imagine so. Yeah.
All right. Well, I'm going to see if I
All right. Well, I'm going to see if I
can make us something cool out of this.
can make us something cool out of this.
The other thing I was thinking about is
The other thing I was thinking about is
like if I wanted to put all the
like if I wanted to put all the
different environments like together so
different environments like together so
you can see some drones making a flag,
you can see some drones making a flag,
some drones doing racing and whatever.
some drones doing racing and whatever.
Um, collision gets obnoxious if I do
Um, collision gets obnoxious if I do
that though.
that though.
It's super obnoxious.
It's super obnoxious.
I've just found just found it online.
I've just found just found it online.
The track is seven square gates arranged

total track length is 75 m.
total track length is 75 m.
30 by 30 by 8. Yeah, we'll just match
30 by 30 by 8. Yeah, we'll just match
that then.
that then.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mhm.
All right. I will try to just get
All right. I will try to just get
working on this. If you guys can get the
working on this. If you guys can get the
drone working, I will see if I can get
drone working, I will see if I can get
like a super stable super general
like a super stable super general
whatever drone whatever course demo
whatever drone whatever course demo
thing and like if the goal is like if we
thing and like if the goal is like if we
just get a really good policy that does
just get a really good policy that does
this then any perturbation of drone and
this then any perturbation of drone and
course should just be solvable
course should just be solvable
instantly. So you end up with like
instantly. So you end up with like
really robust self-correcting policies
really robust self-correcting policies
if you do this. That's the idea.
if you do this. That's the idea.
Mhm. We were working today a bit as well
Mhm. We were working today a bit as well
on improving the kind of like
on improving the kind of like
integration part. So using is it RK4 fin
integration part. So using is it RK4 fin
instead of oilers.
instead of oilers.
Yeah,
Yeah,
that would be Yes, that will be good.
that would be Yes, that will be good.
Please do not do forward oiler on uh
Please do not do forward oiler on uh
I actually do not know how stable RK4 is
I actually do not know how stable RK4 is
even going to be. Like you guys are
even going to be. Like you guys are
probably going to write want to write
probably going to write want to write
something to quantify that
something to quantify that
like the measurements are going to be
like the measurements are going to be
noisy.
It seems like the code for RK4 is going
It seems like the code for RK4 is going
to be pretty about five times anyway.
to be pretty about five times anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Isn't it Isn't it pretty short? I
Isn't it Isn't it pretty short? I
thought RK4 is pretty short.
thought RK4 is pretty short.
I mean, I think it depends how you write
I mean, I think it depends how you write
it, but it's not it's not short for

For like this is right here.
Is this not it?
Is this not it?

Hold on. There's a stream delay.
Or is it just like RK4 for one specific

going to actually finally build the sim
going to actually finally build the sim
instead of yapping all day. But we have
instead of yapping all day. But we have
had some pretty cool growth. So, it's
had some pretty cool growth. So, it's
worth it. But I'll be I'll be right
worth it. But I'll be I'll be right
back. Don't let me forget my mic.
Okay.
Just

Good to see the hard work paying off a

little bit.
Now we will actually build some sims.
Now we will actually build some sims.
I promised this many hours ago, but now
I promised this many hours ago, but now
we will actually build some.
How bad could this possibly be? Right?
Have 400 lines of code here.
Maybe what I do is I keep the drone

Uh these get deleted, right?
Uh these get deleted, right?
These are already in the main file.
Few observations is fine.

It's fine.
It's fine.
This is actually pretty clean.
So, all we really need is the ring
So, all we really need is the ring
buffer from here, right?
So when we init this we have to allocate
So when we init this we have to allocate
to allocate the ring buffer.
And that's pretty much it.
ring has a position.
It's actually
why don't we just zero the whole thing,
why don't we just zero the whole thing,
right?
Yes.
Yes.
Okay. So, we zero out all the rings.
Now, the observations,
the observations are going to need to be
the observations are going to need to be
slightly different.
Yeah, we need to add in the rings.
Yeah, we need to add in the rings.
We can just do the next ring. Like the

Uh we actually

Definitely want this.
Okay, so now we have our ring
and now let's get the plot to this ring.

I'll get it working for you. I'm not

I've been pretty lazy with my uh
I've been pretty lazy with my uh
streaming hours.
We don't need either of these facts,
We don't need either of these facts,
right?
Yeah. We just need these two.
Okay, so for drone swarm,
Okay, so for drone swarm,
we're going to add plus six before I
we're going to add plus six before I
forget to do this
forget to do this
because I added six observations.
It's cool.
I think this is good.
Now, when we do reset here,
we're going to pick a task. Okay.
And what we're going to do is
I wait these
and for now we'll just do it the simple
and for now we'll just do it the simple
way

race
and then this is going to have oops
All right,
you have set target.
If it's a race
then
then we need to do this generation
then we need to do this generation
stuff. Yeah,
we need to do this generation stuff.
Let's see if we clean this up a little
Let's see if we clean this up a little
bit. It's kind of a mess, right?
bit. It's kind of a mess, right?
buffer on one.
If

whatever we do this for now
for
agents
get something like this.
So, if it's a racing task, we do this.
So, if it's a racing task, we do this.
In some way, help me understand this.

And how can I help you? I'm a simple

There's like a whole introduction to

So, people always ask me that. I finally

put together like a comprehensive guide

if you're lacking on uh the fundamentals

I will put my X on the uh in the chat.
It's a much easier read than a lot of

Yeah. Of course,
Yeah. Of course,
the hope with a lot of the educational

now the thing is we've actually made it

into this space and to help with that.
So some of the educational material now
So some of the educational material now
is out there to like help people get
is out there to like help people get

into this space and actually help us
push forward all this research
push forward all this research
definitely to go through this get back

to you. Thank you.
to you. Thank you.
I mean literally all the contributors
I mean literally all the contributors
here like the only difference pretty
here like the only difference pretty
much is uh the ones who actually stuck
much is uh the ones who actually stuck
around and went through the material and
around and went through the material and
and wrote some environments uh have

gotten good and been able to do this. I
gotten good and been able to do this. I

I've given and not been able to do this.
I've given and not been able to do this.
You have to have some basic level of
You have to have some basic level of
programming maturity. That's the only
programming maturity. That's the only
thing I can't fix. I have my programming
thing I can't fix. I have my programming
guide on like how to learn that stuff
guide on like how to learn that stuff
quicker than normal, but that's the only
quicker than normal, but that's the only
thing I can't just like give you the
thing I can't just like give you the
information on.
You have to be able to at least write
You have to be able to at least write

I say is I have like this total mess of

hey not perfect.
hey not perfect.
All right. So
that's going to set the course.
We got to do the ring check, right?
Did we got to do the ring check right
out of bounds?
Yes. Down here.
Oh my gosh, another one of these.
I love the headphones are broken bots.
Hey, I couldn't pay for a

to get rid of that?
to get rid of that?
One of these days I'm gonna end up
One of these days I'm gonna end up
banning somebody who's not actually a

Okay, so this is the logic we need here.

from doing like the all the types of

been like kind of sucky.
But yeah, this is right here. Like these

Yeah. No, I understand. So one quick
Yeah. No, I understand. So one quick
question. Let's say I I'm trying to uh
question. Let's say I I'm trying to uh
build my own custom environment. Uh on
build my own custom environment. Uh on
that case uh if I use you know buffer
that case uh if I use you know buffer
command then do I need to put my
command then do I need to put my
environment inside um ocean?
environment inside um ocean?
Yes. Um if you the reason I suggest
Yes. Um if you the reason I suggest
doing it this way is because otherwise
doing it this way is because otherwise
you have to handle your own C extension
you have to handle your own C extension
build system which unless you really
build system which unless you really
know what you're doing you don't want to
know what you're doing you don't want to
deal with your own C extension build
deal with your own C extension build
system. It is incredibly painful and
system. It is incredibly painful and
makes it's like an undocumented buggy
makes it's like an undocumented buggy
mess and it's because of Python. So like
mess and it's because of Python. So like
you're gonna fight like language um
you're gonna fight like language um
language level and like systems tooling
language level and like systems tooling
level issues if you do it yourself. You
level issues if you do it yourself. You
can absolutely do it, but like
can absolutely do it, but like
you can make it a lot it's a lot easier
you can make it a lot it's a lot easier
if you just basically copy our template
if you just basically copy our template
and then do like work from there.
and then do like work from there.
Yeah. because I was um I was kind of
Yeah. because I was um I was kind of
play around with the buffer
play around with the buffer
uh importable.
uh importable.
It looks like I had to deal with
It looks like I had to deal with
everything
everything
from the beginning. So that's why I'm
from the beginning. So that's why I'm
kind of uh
kind of uh
you can sim if you really want it like
you can sim if you really want it like
let's say that you have your own
let's say that you have your own
environment project, right? And you want
environment project, right? And you want
to have it in its own repo and stuff.
to have it in its own repo and stuff.
If you really want to, you can probably
If you really want to, you can probably
just sim link it,
just sim link it,
right? You have your puffer installed.
right? You have your puffer installed.
You can probably just sim link it in
You can probably just sim link it in
ocean. You probably still have to add
ocean. You probably still have to add
like the one line to environment, but
like the one line to environment, but
you can keep your environment code
you can keep your environment code
separate if you have to.
separate if you have to.
Okay. And I can use a buffer command
Okay. And I can use a buffer command
with it.
with it.
As long as it's in as long as you either
As long as it's in as long as you either
have your environment or you have what
have your environment or you have what
should I think a sim link in there
should I think a sim link in there
should work just as well.
should work just as well.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay. Yeah. That that that will make my
Okay. Yeah. That that that will make my
life. We will eventually figure out a
life. We will eventually figure out a
way to make this experience better so
way to make this experience better so
that you can like more easily have
that you can like more easily have
environments in custom places. But the

thing is like
thing is like
you have to at some point you need to
you have to at some point you need to
invoke an extension build system in

order to get the bindings to work in
order to get the bindings to work in

Python and uh that's really obnoxious,
right?
right?
No, I I was kind of u trying out some uh
No, I I was kind of u trying out some uh
so I I need importable because you know
so I I need importable because you know
I'm trying to do something let's say so
I'm trying to do something let's say so
every time I come here and I'm I need to
every time I come here and I'm I need to
do all the commands instead of it's
do all the commands instead of it's
trying to build something as a platform
trying to build something as a platform
let's say I will interact from
let's say I will interact from
uh let's say a website and I can kind of
uh let's say a website and I can kind of
build general purpose uh thing so that I
build general purpose uh thing so that I
don't have to do everything manually
don't have to do everything manually
each time.
each time.
Y
Y
so that's why I was looking looking for
so that's why I was looking looking for
something that that I can integrate with
something that that I can integrate with
APIs like fast API or some other things
APIs like fast API or some other things
like importable here. So yeah, you can
like importable here. So yeah, you can
that's the reason I was absolutely all
that's the reason I was absolutely all
there like if you're relatively new to
there like if you're relatively new to
like the RL stuff though it the easiest
like the RL stuff though it the easiest
thing is going to be to play with stuff
thing is going to be to play with stuff
the way that we do it in our own
the way that we do it in our own
development first and then after that
development first and then after that
decide if you want to do all that other
decide if you want to do all that other
stuff right like I know it's very
stuff right like I know it's very
tempting to be like oh yeah let me just
tempting to be like oh yeah let me just
put this into something I'm familiar
put this into something I'm familiar
with first but like the way we do stuff
with first but like the way we do stuff
in our own internal dev is very very
in our own internal dev is very very
good for RL and um if you want to do it
good for RL and um if you want to do it
your own way, that's fine. But you
your own way, that's fine. But you
should absolutely like understand how
should absolutely like understand how
we're doing stuff first because RL is
we're doing stuff first because RL is
not trivial. And like there are a bunch
not trivial. And like there are a bunch
of moving parts. We've reduced it to as
of moving parts. We've reduced it to as
few moving parts as possible. But if you
few moving parts as possible. But if you
don't understand how those ones that are
don't understand how those ones that are
left uh are working together, you're not
left uh are working together, you're not
going to be in for a fun time.
going to be in for a fun time.
Yep. That that's why what I faced right
Yep. That that's why what I faced right
now.
now.
Yep. So
Yep. So
that then I I I changed that plan and
that then I I I changed that plan and
trying to understand as deep I can like
trying to understand as deep I can like
kind of recreating existing environment
kind of recreating existing environment
what we have on ocean
what we have on ocean
and then maybe start with like the
and then maybe start with like the
better of a time you're going to have
better of a time you're going to have
right the entire puffer lip source for
right the entire puffer lip source for
all this that you're going to touch is
all this that you're going to touch is
only a few a few thousand lines it's a
only a few a few thousand lines it's a
very short and succinct library uh it
very short and succinct library uh it
gives you a lot a lot of tools with not
gives you a lot a lot of tools with not
a lot of code and you can absolutely
a lot of code and you can absolutely
hack on it, but you're going to have a
hack on it, but you're going to have a
way better time if you understand how
way better time if you understand how
and why we're doing stuff first because
and why we're doing stuff first because
it's not the way that you will like it's
it's not the way that you will like it's
basically not the way anybody else does
basically not the way anybody else does
stuff and there's a very good reason for
stuff and there's a very good reason for
it,
it,
right?
right?
I understood. Yeah.
I understood. Yeah.
Like this is a this is like this is not
Like this is a this is like this is not
just like an out there library that does
just like an out there library that does
weird things for the sake of doing weird
weird things for the sake of doing weird
things. This is like reinforcement
things. This is like reinforcement
learning got nowhere for 10 years. Um,
learning got nowhere for 10 years. Um,
we had to completely rethink how it was
we had to completely rethink how it was
done in order to make everything fast
done in order to make everything fast
and sane and simple. That's why it is
and sane and simple. That's why it is
the way that it is.
It looks like
It looks like
it looks like you have this working now.
it looks like you have this working now.
Yeah. Yeah. No, thank you. Thank you for
Yeah. Yeah. No, thank you. Thank you for
your time. Yeah.
your time. Yeah.
All right. Yeah. I'm gonna hop off this,
All right. Yeah. I'm gonna hop off this,
right?
right?
Okay. All right.
Okay. All right.
Okay. Uh, looks like I got to go take a
Okay. Uh, looks like I got to go take a
call.
I'm going to go take a call, I think,
I'm going to go take a call, I think,
real quick. Um,
real quick. Um,
and then I've got two more meetings
and then I've got two more meetings
afterwards.
I'm going to give it like another
I'm going to give it like another
Let me at least see if I can just fix
Let me at least see if I can just fix
this one last bug and then I'll go see
this one last bug and then I'll go see
about my poll.
Why is this thing nearest?
Yes.
Okay. The intensity is n
max RPM because max RPM.
max RPM because max RPM.
Oh, I don't call it a drone dummy.
What's wrong with this?
Asan me copy.
Do I have this right?
Do I have this right?
Is it not getting is not getting cold or
Is it not getting is not getting cold or
something?
Is this not calic?
Is this not calic?
Oh yeah, this doesn't cal.
Okay, lovely.
This actually runs now.
Now,
can we train this on a specific task?
Oh, we need to adjust the binding file,
Oh, we need to adjust the binding file,
right? Cuz like we added max rings.
So, we'll just do
So, we'll just do
X rings.
Oops. All right, I got to go take a
Oops. All right, I got to go take a
call, it turns out. So, um, let me
call, it turns out. So, um, let me
answer this one question real quick.
answer this one question real quick.
Revisited my rain, uh, I revisited my
Revisited my rain, uh, I revisited my
implementation of the rainbow paper and
implementation of the rainbow paper and
got it
got it
to work with Puffer Lib. Have not tested
to work with Puffer Lib. Have not tested
it. What do you think I should do next?
it. What do you think I should do next?
Yeah. um get it on to puffer lib and run
Yeah. um get it on to puffer lib and run
it on like just pong and breakout
it on like just pong and breakout
basically. Just get the really basic
basically. Just get the really basic
environments working and then we'll go
environments working and then we'll go
next steps from there. That would be
next steps from there. That would be
yeah once you have something like that I
yeah once you have something like that I
will jump in and I will help more. I got
will jump in and I will help more. I got
to run yeah I got like three business
to run yeah I got like three business
meetings.
meetings.
I'd like to be streaming more stuff but
I'd like to be streaming more stuff but
hey got to grow the company. Um I will
hey got to grow the company. Um I will
be back probably tomorrow. What's
be back probably tomorrow. What's
tomorrow? Saturday. Yeah, I'll be back
tomorrow? Saturday. Yeah, I'll be back
tomorrow first thing with more stuff. If
tomorrow first thing with more stuff. If
you like what you see, if you're new
you like what you see, if you're new
