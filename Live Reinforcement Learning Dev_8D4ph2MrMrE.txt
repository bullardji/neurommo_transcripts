okay we should be
live
live
yeah there we
yeah there we
go how's it
going we've got some stuff to do today
let's
start with looking at some
start with looking at some
experiments I'm on quite late
experiments I'm on quite late
today goal is to
today goal is to
do 3ish showers maybe three a shower
do 3ish showers maybe three a shower
stream uh and we're going to do some
stream uh and we're going to do some
work on the mooba maybe some work on
work on the mooba maybe some work on
some other ends and a bunch of stuff hey
some other ends and a bunch of stuff hey
linky how's it going
okay no new runs on Saturday it
okay no new runs on Saturday it
says let's see what we
says let's see what we
have going on
here screwed up my hand a little bit
we should have two
we should have two
sweeps number one number
two Space Invaders
here is getting better we're going to
here is getting better we're going to
see if it how long it takes maybe it
see if it how long it takes maybe it
should be able to figure something
should be able to figure something
better out
better out
eventually we'll run for a while
and look at that perfect
and look at that perfect
timing we have a nice 2.1k
timing we have a nice 2.1k
ELO set of
ELO set of
parameters so I guess what we're going
parameters so I guess what we're going
to do is we're going to look at these
to do is we're going to look at these
set these as defaults train this
set these as defaults train this
model and hopefully that will give us a
model and hopefully that will give us a
nice new policy to play with
nice new policy to play with
we'll do some other stuff on the
we'll do some other stuff on the
environment today few other
environment today few other
things we be
good mainly though this will be
good mainly though this will be
a few hours just to get a little bit of
a few hours just to get a little bit of
Dev in um and then the main thing I'd be
Dev in um and then the main thing I'd be
working on this weekend is finally
working on this weekend is finally
finishing that video that will just free
finishing that video that will just free
up a lot of mental band
up a lot of mental band
with I don't know if I'll be able to
with I don't know if I'll be able to
finish it this weekend either it's a lot
finish it this weekend either it's a lot
of work it's a lot a lot of work
of work it's a lot a lot of work
I got
I got
um the final like camera footage for
um the final like camera footage for
that I'm going to have to
that I'm going to have to
get I'm waiting until Sunday I got I
get I'm waiting until Sunday I got I
bought some lighting set up and I'm
bought some lighting set up and I'm
going to hopefully be able to film that
going to hopefully be able to film that
in here we'll
in here we'll
see um but yeah it's it's like a pretty
see um but yeah it's it's like a pretty
extensive I it's like a 20 minute
extensive I it's like a 20 minute
script to have to do uh to go through
script to have to do uh to go through
right pretty well
oh look there are all of our stats This
oh look there are all of our stats This
Is
Good
Good
Hat okay these are our policies here
um we actually might want to train this
um we actually might want to train this
locally because we're not going to
locally because we're not going to
really need to mess up this sweep yeah
really need to mess up this sweep yeah
we'll train this locally for now that'll
we'll train this locally for now that'll
be
better hey bet
welcome got start docker
cool
we are setting hyper parameters to these
we are setting hyper parameters to these
ones which apparently are
ones which apparently are
good I'm a little bit concerned how low
good I'm a little bit concerned how low
the death reward uh how like small the
the death reward uh how like small the
death penalty
death penalty
is I guess it wasn't huge to begin
is I guess it wasn't huge to begin
with but uh I mean I guess I could buy
with but uh I mean I guess I could buy
it
it
what's the XP
what's the XP
reward very
reward very
low Tower reward is
low Tower reward is
high and then distance reward is 0.0
high and then distance reward is 0.0
because that's what we set this to be we
because that's what we set this to be we
wanted it to not be uh constrained
wanted it to not be uh constrained
by having to
by having to
rush
rush
basically and let's see the other prams
basically and let's see the other prams
batch size is the same BPT Horizon of 16
batch size is the same BPT Horizon of 16
is
is
good checkpoint in LEL
good checkpoint in LEL
50 clip
coefficient where is this it goes from
coefficient where is this it goes from
o0 point that's a very low clip
o0 point that's a very low clip
coefficient uh
coefficient uh
entropy very low
entropy yeah very low entropy
reasonable
Lambda very reasonable
Lambda very reasonable
Lambda uh slightly
Lambda uh slightly
low oops did I just do that backwards
low oops did I just do that backwards
yes I did uh slightly low gamma but
yes I did uh slightly low gamma but
higher than before is probably trending
higher than before is probably trending
in the correct
in the correct
direction uh learning rate goes
direction uh learning rate goes
substantially
substantially
lower probably a good thing and then Max
lower probably a good thing and then Max
grad Norm uh also gets
grad Norm uh also gets
lowered mini batch size stays the
same okay the value function
same okay the value function
coefficients are actually like kind of
coefficients are actually like kind of
reasonable which is nice to
reasonable which is nice to
see that's the clip
see that's the clip
coefficient so the clip is very
coefficient so the clip is very
low uh and then the value function
low uh and then the value function
coefficient
coefficient
is kind kind of reasonable
is kind kind of reasonable
here and that's
here and that's
it and how long did this train for
232 we're actually going to use the
232 we're actually going to use the
exact number just because
stability okay
MOBA mode train VC
MOBA mode train VC
multiprocessing
track
Baseline uh I probably should
just should do this just in case yeah
just should do this just in case yeah
it's
fine going here
and there we
and there we
go so whoops I guess this we have to
go so whoops I guess this we have to
leave this up in the background I'll
leave this up in the background I'll
just move
this I will just move this onto whoops
this I will just move this onto whoops
the other
screen working on hold on let me pull
screen working on hold on let me pull
the chat so I can see it working
the chat so I can see it working
on making spaces default policy faster
on making spaces default policy faster
for non
for non
ulated testing shows very slightly loss
ulated testing shows very slightly loss
some yeah well you have checks in the uh
some yeah well you have checks in the uh
the forward pass
basically
basically
1K I don't know if it's 1K of how many
1K I don't know if it's 1K of how many
if it's even statistically
if it's even statistically
significant but yeah generally you want
significant but yeah generally you want
to avoid doing stuff in the forward
to avoid doing stuff in the forward
pass that's like every
pass that's like every
conditional every Loop
conditional every Loop
I'm trying to think what I want to even
I'm trying to think what I want to even
do today because I uh the main thing I
do today because I uh the main thing I
had in my head was getting the video
had in my head was getting the video
stuff done and I made some decent
stuff done and I made some decent
progress on
progress on
it there's a lot of stuff we can do I'm
it there's a lot of stuff we can do I'm
trying to think if it's time to start
trying to think if it's time to start
thinking about data structures in the
thinking about data structures in the
MOBA or if there things that
MOBA or if there things that
initially I still need to do on
this it is less
Okay
Okay
so start a stream I guess uh yeah see
so start a stream I guess uh yeah see
you in a few hours but I guess I'm gonna
you in a few hours but I guess I'm gonna
at the start here I might as well talk
at the start here I might as well talk
through uh some of my thoughts
through uh some of my thoughts
on the environment stuff with
on the environment stuff with
puffer
puffer
so there are a few issues at the moment
so there are a few issues at the moment
right there's kind of a lot of
right there's kind of a lot of
boilerplate for each environment just
boilerplate for each environment just
because of matching the puffer
because of matching the puffer
API um the clients are really fast to
API um the clients are really fast to
write in puffer I mean in uh in Python
write in puffer I mean in uh in Python
but they're not super
but they're not super
performant uh we also
performant uh we also
have the Sims themselves like the grid
have the Sims themselves like the grid
system or whatever is kind of reused
system or whatever is kind of reused
everywhere and there are a bunch of bugs
everywhere and there are a bunch of bugs
that come up from um interacting with
that come up from um interacting with
the grid system and like leaving ghosts
the grid system and like leaving ghosts
on the field or
whatever so I think that
whatever so I think that
there's probably a reasonably easy way
there's probably a reasonably easy way
to make I don't want to say like a full
to make I don't want to say like a full
engine because I actually really like
engine because I actually really like
stuff like all this stuff working just
stuff like all this stuff working just
from scratch but maybe like the grid
from scratch but maybe like the grid
itself can be a component or
itself can be a component or
something
something
um yeah there's like some there are a
um yeah there's like some there are a
few like structural things I think that
few like structural things I think that
could be made easier across these
could be made easier across these
various different
various different
environments uh the other thing is it
environments uh the other thing is it
does annoy me not having these things be
does annoy me not having these things be
like runnable on web and not having like
like runnable on web and not having like
the debug tools right not having like a
the debug tools right not having like a
basic debugger that plays nicely the
basic debugger that plays nicely the
scon one looks okay but it's not really
scon one looks okay but it's not really
what I want
um I at the same time I'm like do I
um I at the same time I'm like do I
really want to just start porting all
really want to just start porting all
these different Sims to
these different Sims to
see is that the way to go
let's think about this what's left in
let's think about this what's left in
the MOBA that I haven't implemented
the MOBA that I haven't implemented
feature-wise
that I actually want to
implement like maybe we want to add some
implement like maybe we want to add some
sort of vision
sort of vision
control
maybe
um we have the abilities they're easy to
balance I mean really at this point it
balance I mean really at this point it
just needs to look a little
just needs to look a little
nicer we need to see what strategies can
nicer we need to see what strategies can
be learned on
be learned on
it and clean it up a bit like we can
it and clean it up a bit like we can
potentially add Vision later but pretty
potentially add Vision later but pretty
much we have all the core stuff I wanted
much we have all the core stuff I wanted
with this
I wouldn't mind doing a little bit
crunchier systems work
today I think it's a it's not a bad time
today I think it's a it's not a bad time
honestly for us to just like cuz I mean
honestly for us to just like cuz I mean
logistically I'm only going to have like
logistically I'm only going to have like
three or so hours today to play with
three or so hours today to play with
some stuff I might be starting more Sims
some stuff I might be starting more Sims
next week I have existing
next week I have existing
Sims uh outside of this mooba that like
Sims uh outside of this mooba that like
also need to be finalized and Polished
also need to be finalized and Polished
up and their main things that bother me
up and their main things that bother me
are just a little bit of Jank around
are just a little bit of Jank around
like General API and
like General API and
stuff
stuff
and a bit of stuff about the data
and a bit of stuff about the data
structures I'd
say yeah I'm trying think if this is the
say yeah I'm trying think if this is the
highest priority thing with puffer at
highest priority thing with puffer at
the moment and I think that outside
the moment and I think that outside
of the video it kind of is like making
of the video it kind of is like making
these environments really good really
these environments really good really
stable really performant and really easy
stable really performant and really easy
to use and
to use and
run is kind of the most important
thing the only thing that really gives
thing the only thing that really gives
me a pause at all is the fact that I've
me a pause at all is the fact that I've
basically told viewers like yeah go
basically told viewers like yeah go
ahead and just Implement stuff in cython
ahead and just Implement stuff in cython
and that is correct like there is no
and that is correct like there is no
performance reason to not just do stuff
performance reason to not just do stuff
in scyon and for most devs it's going to
in scyon and for most devs it's going to
be
be
easier and I think even for me it'll be
easier and I think even for me it'll be
easier maybe what I should do at the
easier maybe what I should do at the
moment you know what would be cool why
moment you know what would be cool why
don't we go to the snake end for a bit
don't we go to the snake end for a bit
which is uh the sea snake en and see if
which is uh the sea snake en and see if
I can figure out ways to
I can figure out ways to
like fix the little pieces that bother
like fix the little pieces that bother
me with how I had to implement that like
me with how I had to implement that like
the things that I had to do and see that
the things that I had to do and see that
I would have had easier in scon as well
I would have had easier in scon as well
as like the bindings to python let me
as like the bindings to python let me
see if I can like make that project
see if I can like make that project
really clean and
really clean and
simple
because if I can make that if I can get
because if I can make that if I can get
that project to the point where I'm
that project to the point where I'm
satisfied that
it's like uh as minimal as it can
it's like uh as minimal as it can
be then I think from there it would be
be then I think from there it would be
quite easy to move more stuff to C and
quite easy to move more stuff to C and
the other nice thing is you can
the other nice thing is you can
technically even do it
technically even do it
incrementally
incrementally
because yeah you can technically even do
because yeah you can technically even do
things
things
incrementally because syon can import C
incrementally because syon can import C
files right so I can just start like
files right so I can just start like
putting utilities and stuff into C
putting utilities and stuff into C
and like making sure with the Moa stuff
and like making sure with the Moa stuff
is good I can probably incrementally
Port probably wouldn't be that
hard okay well I mean I think that
hard okay well I mean I think that
people generally like the low-l stuff
people generally like the low-l stuff
and um I mean not as much as me screwing
and um I mean not as much as me screwing
around with Graphics right but unless we
around with Graphics right but unless we
have folks like actively looking at the
have folks like actively looking at the
graphics with me and helping on stuff I
graphics with me and helping on stuff I
think I'm going to look spend a little
think I'm going to look spend a little
bit of time looking at these for now uh
bit of time looking at these for now uh
the one thing though before I do that
the one thing though before I do that
is it would be really nice to get GPU
is it would be really nice to get GPU
Drive stuff
Drive stuff
working but I kind of have other
working but I kind of have other
experiments going at the moment and
experiments going at the moment and
we're sort of Hardware capped so I might
we're sort of Hardware capped so I might
leave that for a few more
leave that for a few more
days
days
yeah I I want to do this for now because
yeah I I want to do this for now because
this kind of affects my for how I'm
this kind of affects my for how I'm
going to do stuff in the future
going to do stuff in the future
and um the the video is going to be
and um the the video is going to be
taking basically all my other mental
taking basically all my other mental
bandwidth uh over the weekend um I'm
bandwidth uh over the weekend um I'm
hoping I actually can record at least a
hoping I actually can record at least a
few of the final clips for that over the
few of the final clips for that over the
weekend
weekend
but I'm not confident I'll be able to do
but I'm not confident I'll be able to do
that I only get the camera the camera
that I only get the camera the camera
equipment on Sunday I don't know what
equipment on Sunday I don't know what
time
time
so basically before then I'm going to be
so basically before then I'm going to be
going through the script refining it
going through the script refining it
practicing it
practicing it
and doing other basic video editing
and doing other basic video editing
things
things
okay let's start on let's start on a few
okay let's start on let's start on a few
cool things and we have the MOBA and
cool things and we have the MOBA and
training in the background while we're
training in the background while we're
looking at this but uh yeah let let's
looking at this but uh yeah let let's
start on a few things so I want two
start on a few things so I want two
windows
here we'll do like this
here we'll do like this
today some
gaps cool
okay I'm trying to think how I want to
okay I'm trying to think how I want to
change the
initial bindings
I think what I want to do
I think what I want to do
is snake.
is snake.
pie C snake.
pie C snake.
pie and then
let's see if this what happens here sea
let's see if this what happens here sea
snake has no
Let's do let's do like
this okay so here is uh the snen running
this okay so here is uh the snen running
in rib it's very
nice now we are going to want to make
nice now we are going to want to make
these M's in
C so now we need to figure out C
extensions Pi object
no I hate
this set string I hate all this
stuff I really do not want to have to
stuff I really do not want to have to
put Pi [ __ ] into
put Pi [ __ ] into
C so that's a no
definitely don't want to do
this C types wrapper
this
maybe what do we think about this
maybe what do we think about this
versus I think I should start with what
versus I think I should start with what
I know and then see how simple it
I know and then see how simple it
is so the thing I know how to do at the
is so the thing I know how to do at the
moment is I know how to do this from
moment is I know how to do this from
scyon
right why is my desktop
right why is my desktop
complaining oh it's complaining cuz I'm
complaining oh it's complaining cuz I'm
training a model that's
training a model that's
fine uh let me make sure we don't have
fine uh let me make sure we don't have
the best cooling setup at the moment let
the best cooling setup at the moment let
me just make
me just make
sure we have uh temperatures that are
sure we have uh temperatures that are
not about to shut me off due to
not about to shut me off due to
thermals oh that's not good at
thermals oh that's not good at
all uh hold
on [ __ ] uh what do I do about that
I guess I can't be training models
I guess I can't be training models
locally until I get better
locally until I get better
cooling that's
awkward how long until this one is
done 13 minutes
okay here's what I'm going to
okay here's what I'm going to
do going to kill
do going to kill
that this will go back down to something
that this will go back down to something
insane
again I'm going to make I'm just going
again I'm going to make I'm just going
to run it over the other process on the
to run it over the other process on the
desktop
and I have to commit this don't
I yeah the problem is there's there are
I yeah the problem is there's there are
no case fans at the moment and it's like
no case fans at the moment and it's like
a mini ITX so it has a small cooler
yeah let
me for [ __ ]
sake for
okay these are the right settings
whatever see if this runs
oh
well uh I guess I can't run this policy
well uh I guess I can't run this policy
for a
for a
while that's okay we'll do something
while that's okay we'll do something
else anyways we'll just do something
else anyways we'll just do something
else let's just do the snake stuff uh
else let's just do the snake stuff uh
this will be important anyways and this
this will be important anyways and this
will get potentially change the
will get potentially change the
Moa I'm not dealing with this right now
okay so really what I want here
okay so really what I want here
is like this thing maybe
h
so we're going to
do import
do import
this this is going to take us a little
this this is going to take us a little
bit to figure out how to do
properly so we include snake.
sea
snake and then we'll
do okay so all this stuff here
you have all these various different
you have all these various different
variables and then you
do c snake star
do c snake star
snake
snake
n and then you
do yeah this
do yeah this
right so you basically just write this
right so you basically just write this
giant rapper thing
do you need to store any of these
do you need to store any of these
variables
or can I just do like
this uh Char
this uh Char
grid and I just tab like
grid and I just tab like
this and then
can I just do this
these twitch Bots are really
obnoxious okay so now you have the
obnoxious okay so now you have the
environment
and then we want to do step
right
right
snake yeah I'm messing with some C code
snake yeah I'm messing with some C code
welcome I can look at some of the art
welcome I can look at some of the art
stuff too as as well now if you'd like
stuff too as as well now if you'd like
I'm just looking at some lowl stuff
I'm just looking at some lowl stuff
trying to figure out some like because
trying to figure out some like because
like now we have people talking about
like now we have people talking about
tower defenses we got people talking
tower defenses we got people talking
about you know PVP Sims we've got
about you know PVP Sims we've got
potentially artwork for stuff we've got
potentially artwork for stuff we've got
this I've got other people talking to me
this I've got other people talking to me
about different environments so I'm
about different environments so I'm
trying to figure out some of the lower
trying to figure out some of the lower
level stuff as to like how I'm going to
level stuff as to like how I'm going to
make it easier for everybody to organize
make it easier for everybody to organize
and contribute all these environments
and contribute all these environments
without having like tons and tons and
without having like tons and tons and
tons of repeated buggy
tons of repeated buggy
code busy busy
code busy busy
yeah you
yeah you
know I look at
know I look at
Art I pull Discord
up let me look at this Frame that you
up let me look at this Frame that you
sent
me can I
so this
is like some of these background
elements you have this outlined
okay I was actually thinking about um
okay I was actually thinking about um
I was thinking about the assets
I was thinking about the assets
and it would make sense I think that
and it would make sense I think that
there might be these actually might fit
there might be these actually might fit
the
the
Moa and I could use the puffers as
Moa and I could use the puffers as
minions and then I could use your
minions and then I could use your
Sprites as like the heroes since they're
Sprites as like the heroes since they're
like visually distinct and
like visually distinct and
such
such
um yeah I was thinking about doing
that do you think they're a spot where
that do you think they're a spot where
it would be a good idea for me to import
it would be a good idea for me to import
them and play around with them at the
them and play around with them at the
moment or um yeah what do you think we
moment or um yeah what do you think we
should do with
should do with
that if you want to see what they look
that if you want to see what they look
like in the main game I'd be down to do
like in the main game I'd be down to do
that if not I can just work on the C for
that if not I can just work on the C for
a bit
the background elements are cool as
well plan on giving you full animation
well plan on giving you full animation
sets
sets
awesome I could do it with the Statics
awesome I could do it with the Statics
at the moment cuz it'll like it would be
at the moment cuz it'll like it would be
some work to load in the animation sets
some work to load in the animation sets
in the first place cuz I have to do like
in the first place cuz I have to do like
rib doesn't give you an animation system
rib doesn't give you an animation system
I have to do it manually frame by frame
idle a cast attack death
idle a cast attack death
hurt uh I think that if you want to like
hurt uh I think that if you want to like
just get something to start with the two
just get something to start with the two
most important ones I honestly the most
most important ones I honestly the most
important one is just the move animation
important one is just the move animation
like I guess idle and move
right how do you do your animation sets
right how do you do your animation sets
as well do you just do do uh Sprite
as well do you just do do uh Sprite
sheets or what do you do and also what's
sheets or what do you do and also what's
the source res of these that's uh those
the source res of these that's uh those
are two important things to
know I wouldn't mind doing this real
know I wouldn't mind doing this real
quick since you have cool art for me I
quick since you have cool art for me I
wouldn't mind real quick just taking a
wouldn't mind real quick just taking a
look and seeing if I can import
these scaled 32
32 48 48 canvas for okay
that matches the current resolution for
that matches the current resolution for
sure uh it's going to be tiny on a 4K
sure uh it's going to be tiny on a 4K
you'd have to like exact upscale to
you'd have to like exact upscale to
maintain the pixel like the pixel art
maintain the pixel like the pixel art
style 12 frames are under
perfect I think it's going to it's
perfect I think it's going to it's
substantially less than 12 isn't it like
substantially less than 12 isn't it like
how many are these
they're
they're
nice 2X or 4X when doing yeah that's
nice 2X or 4X when doing yeah that's
fine I know it's like a total pain to do
fine I know it's like a total pain to do
it at higher res and then it's like hard
it at higher res and then it's like hard
to like get pixel art consistent with
to like get pixel art consistent with
higher
higher
res the only thing I was initially
res the only thing I was initially
worried about is like the fact that
worried about is like the fact that
we've got this kind of smooth like
we've got this kind of smooth like
Shader feel for the Moa and I don't know
Shader feel for the Moa and I don't know
how the pixel art uh conflicts maybe
how the pixel art uh conflicts maybe
with that but we'll load these in and
with that but we'll load these in and
let's see
do you have these on a sheet at the
do you have these on a sheet at the
moment that I can uh do you have these
moment that I can uh do you have these
on like a transparent sheet 3232 or what
on like a transparent sheet 3232 or what
should I do load these
should I do load these
in I showed you the sheet that I had
in I showed you the sheet that I had
before
right if you just have these in like any
right if you just have these in like any
reasonable format I can slot them in
reasonable format I can slot them in
real quick
imagine my 300 by 300 plus tarot
imagine my 300 by 300 plus tarot
cards single sheet I mean I'll I'll show
cards single sheet I mean I'll I'll show
you what I was going to do with them um
um oh I guess I have to change the
um oh I guess I have to change the
Sprite sheet don't
Sprite sheet don't
I yeah I have to change the Sprite sheet
I yeah I have to change the Sprite sheet
anyways I'm going to have to like exact
anyways I'm going to have to like exact
upscale them uh photos get rid of
this cuz I think the source sheets for
this cuz I think the source sheets for
the mm Mo
the mm Mo
[Music]
[Music]
or let me double check I'm pretty sure
or let me double check I'm pretty sure
the store sheet is 128 128 and then it
the store sheet is 128 128 and then it
gets
downscaled so these are like the assets
downscaled so these are like the assets
I have at the moment I could just put
I have at the moment I could just put
them in here right
yeah I have it on one
sheet I can show you the way I've done
sheet I can show you the way I've done
animations in the past for stuff but
animations in the past for stuff but
like I think you'll know it's pretty
like I think you'll know it's pretty
standard right like with animations I
standard right like with animations I
just do them in a row so you basically
just do them in a row so you basically
just like increment the position in the
just like increment the position in the
Sprite sheet by whatever the the frame
Sprite sheet by whatever the the frame
size
is man in some way doing like pixel
is man in some way doing like pixel
animation is gets to be harder than
animation is gets to be harder than
doing like 3D animation because you
doing like 3D animation because you
can't like reuse
can't like reuse
stuff as spr should have the option
stuff as spr should have the option
well I mean the render engine that I
well I mean the render engine that I
have is
have is
um
um
custom it's not hard for me to figure
custom it's not hard for me to figure
stuff out
though get you an artist who can do
both heck yeah
this e
just do
this
for
for
e
e e
right for
oh did you send him to me a long time
ago oh you sent me
ago oh you sent me
wow you actually holy hell I didn't
wow you actually holy hell I didn't
realize you did this many key frames
realize you did this many key frames
[ __ ] that must have taken a while thank
you oh what you did something with the
you oh what you did something with the
Stars as
Stars as
well
wait this is
wait this is
Sweet
Holy two major keys
oh I
see I've made animation systems before I
see I've made animation systems before I
gotta I want more of these stupid things
gotta I want more of these stupid things
in C because I don't know what it is
in C because I don't know what it is
with scon it's like the code ends up
with scon it's like the code ends up
just being so un so hard to reuse
just being so un so hard to reuse
compared to see
but I should at some point I will make
but I should at some point I will make
like a render thing that has like a
like a render thing that has like a
little animation system so I I should be
little animation system so I I should be
able to support like variable timing or
able to support like variable timing or
whatever per frame
whatever per frame
maybe but yeah these is great for now
maybe but yeah these is great for now
this format's amazing for
now I mean I had like the assets I had
now I mean I had like the assets I had
to work with before it was like I bought
to work with before it was like I bought
a bunch of these assets and I had to do
a bunch of these assets and I had to do
all this work collating Sprite sheets it
all this work collating Sprite sheets it
was like thousands of like
was like thousands of like
procedural stuff things for the Sprite
procedural stuff things for the Sprite
sheets and then like I got to it and you
sheets and then like I got to it and you
had to like overlay them in specific
had to like overlay them in specific
orders that were not consistent and then
orders that were not consistent and then
like specific frames had different
like specific frames had different
timings in
timings in
milliseconds yeah it was
milliseconds yeah it was
rough this is nice and
rough this is nice and
easy engine Dev crazy is not
easy engine Dev crazy is not
hard it's really not
hard I've been looking for reasons to
hard I've been looking for reasons to
write more
C
frankly global
don't [ __ ] with variable
don't [ __ ] with variable
timing repeat the cell
timing repeat the cell
yeah uh careful with 100 millisecs
yeah uh careful with 100 millisecs
because it's
because it's
currently there are five and I could
currently there are five and I could
change this technically but there
change this technically but there
currently the environment runs at an
currently the environment runs at an
internal rate of five ticks per second
internal rate of five ticks per second
so if you're going to run 60 frames per
so if you're going to run 60 frames per
second that means you
second that means you
have um
have um
well I mean I guess it's the standard
well I mean I guess it's the standard
like whatever 1 over 60
like whatever 1 over 60
right but like 100 millisecond intervals
right but like 100 millisecond intervals
may or may not be available
basically I think if you wanted to do
basically I think if you wanted to do
like the really rough crunchy
like the really rough crunchy
animations and like you wanted to have
animations and like you wanted to have
one frame per game tick then it would be
one frame per game tick then it would be
0.2 like it would be 200 milliseconds
0.2 like it would be 200 milliseconds
but then if you wanted to do like proper
but then if you wanted to do like proper
animation
animation
it would be you know 12 12 key frames
it would be you know 12 12 key frames
and then the Whole Thing is. 2 seconds
and then the Whole Thing is. 2 seconds
but that's going to be really really
but that's going to be really really
slow I mean that's going to be really
slow I mean that's going to be really
really fast for some of these so we'll
really fast for some of these so we'll
have to figure some stuff out but
have to figure some stuff out but
regardless you would use raw c
regardless you would use raw c
yeah I like
C I mean I've been doing syon for a lot
C I mean I've been doing syon for a lot
of this and I've been wanting to Port
of this and I've been wanting to Port
more of it into C so I can use it on the
more of it into C so I can use it on the
web
web
plus it's just it's it's kind of
fun I get a few nice
things I really I haven't written C in
things I really I haven't written C in
like 10 years until this like little
like 10 years until this like little
snake project I did this is C right here
snake project I did this is C right here
um yeah it's nice if you want to play
um yeah it's nice if you want to play
with it it's on the web like this is the
with it it's on the web like this is the
reason I do
it you can just go to puffer
it you can just go to puffer
Ai and there you go go here snake in
Ai and there you go go here snake in
your browser played against RL
your browser played against RL
agents you can just play this yellow
snake renderer
snake Okay this
snake Okay this
works
then
close there we
go so I'm sure that I'll have to fix
go so I'm sure that I'll have to fix
this but
this but
like as far as a binding file goes I
like as far as a binding file goes I
could still use syon for it this would
could still use syon for it this would
be substantially less painful than the
be substantially less painful than the
corresponding p
bind it's still kind of
bind it's still kind of
gross I don't really like it that much
but let me see what the render uh args
but let me see what the render uh args
are withd height
are withd height
colors and tile

great I have to fix merge [ __ ]

I know I have been looking to just write
I know I have been looking to just write
way more C I think I'm going to enjoy
way more C I think I'm going to enjoy
that there well I may or may not there's
that there well I may or may not there's
it's kind of conditional on me being
it's kind of conditional on me being
able to figure out there are a couple
able to figure out there are a couple
small things I haven't figure been able
small things I haven't figure been able
to figure out how to do and see yet like
cleanly pretty much the only thing I
cleanly pretty much the only thing I
haven't been able to figure out how to
haven't been able to figure out how to
do cleanly is manipulating um
do cleanly is manipulating um
multi-dimensional arrays if I can figure
multi-dimensional arrays if I can figure
out how to do that then like yeah C is
out how to do that then like yeah C is
just as easy as anything else and like
just as easy as anything else and like
very
nice where's this thing
oh jeez is
this welcome YouTube
this welcome YouTube
folks we're on late today because I have
folks we're on late today because I have
to work uh on there's a video I'm
to work uh on there's a video I'm
working on for the
working on for the
channel take some time so I put in some
channel take some time so I put in some
hours on that first but we're here we're
hours on that first but we're here we're
doing some cool lowl stuff I am
doing some cool lowl stuff I am
currently very confused with it but uh
currently very confused with it but uh
we'll figure it out and I'm hoping we
we'll figure it out and I'm hoping we
can build something pretty
can build something pretty
cool I'm essentially using the snake
cool I'm essentially using the snake
game that I wrote which is way
simpler as an opportunity to figure out
simpler as an opportunity to figure out
if there are some infrastructure
if there are some infrastructure
improvements I can make to the
MOBA I was literally looking up DLC

why I hate
why I hate
C++ there's too much
C++ there's too much
[ __ ] I do not use C++ if I can at

all avoid it like
ever hooking it into my

nice and fast for sure I mean have you
nice and fast for sure I mean have you
seen the C have you seen the uh the

source code for the snake
source code for the snake

this is pretty nice for
this is pretty nice for
Sims also what Sims are you working on
Sims also what Sims are you working on
I'm curious to
know I'll link it to
know I'll link it to
you the main thing with puffer is Sims
Iran so there are multiple different
Iran so there are multiple different
versions of uh the game in here but if
versions of uh the game in here but if
you want the one that is raw
you want the one that is raw
C is not that bad right
C is not that bad right
here there's also a scon version that's
here there's also a scon version that's
almost the same
do you have to do this
from I built the Sim in C and the dlll
from I built the Sim in C and the dlll
in C++
yeah I mean any like compiled language
yeah I mean any like compiled language
without I forget if C has C does have
without I forget if C has C does have
garbage collection right
but uh basically any like compiled
but uh basically any like compiled
language without extra [ __ ] should
language without extra [ __ ] should
be able to be made fast for
Sims C def exter FR okay this is the

this is different the ones at work it

very are very specific I
see well one of the main things I'm
see well one of the main things I'm
going to be doing with puffer um on the
going to be doing with puffer um on the
business side is making it easier for
business side is making it easier for
companies

to do high perf simulators and

that's the main Jam here
I see so this needs to be

compiled

trying to figure this out I haven't like
trying to figure this out I haven't like
this is not a space I work in very
this is not a space I work in very
frequently um I the reason I'm like
frequently um I the reason I'm like
looking at making uh putting all the
looking at making uh putting all the
Sims into C is because it makes them
Sims into C is because it makes them
easy to run on the web and like the
easy to run on the web and like the
scyon code that I'm writing is

much just the same as the C would be so
much just the same as the C would be so
I'm looking at this a porting option
I'm looking at this a porting option
like I did I did a trial right with the
like I did I did a trial right with the
snake Sim and this works really well so
snake Sim and this works really well so
I'm looking at porting more complex

for viewers in the meantime what I'm
for viewers in the meantime what I'm
doing at the moment um there's like a

low-level ones that are written in scon

version of the snake environment that I
version of the snake environment that I
wrote and I'm writing the glue for that
wrote and I'm writing the glue for that

and then I'm going to see if I can
reduce the amount of glue required to
reduce the amount of glue required to
the point that like I'm essentially
the point that like I'm essentially
happy with this for puffer lib overall

than infecting the C

see these memory views these make it

and like all the data structures that I

there's a lot of stuff going on here um
there's a lot of stuff going on here um
when you're running the full training
when you're running the full training
syst you're allocating giant blocks of

those blocks into the C code which is
those blocks into the C code which is
then going to write into them so your

some obscure piece of
documentation let me know if that okay
documentation let me know if that okay
let me see if I can fix this one fix
let me see if I can fix this one fix
this one thing and then I'll I'll check
this one thing and then I'll I'll check
that uh South
oh do you just go straight to the data
oh do you just go straight to the data
that's kind of obvious isn't
it okay I guess I'm just
it okay I guess I'm just
dumb uh we'll fix this later I see what
dumb uh we'll fix this later I see what
I was doing wrong let's see uh this
I was doing wrong let's see uh this
Sprite
sheet look at
these it's pretty awesome
these it's pretty awesome
I love just being able to like Dev on
I love just being able to like Dev on
stuff and have artwork like cool artwork
stuff and have artwork like cool artwork
appear that I can use to actually make
appear that I can use to actually make
all these Sims look good this is pretty
awesome it's kind of cool in a way too
awesome it's kind of cool in a way too
because it's like I know how to write my
because it's like I know how to write my
own code I don't know how to do any of
own code I don't know how to do any of
this stuff I haven't even begun to
this stuff I haven't even begun to
flex oh wa I can't do do hold
flex oh wa I can't do do hold
on I have to do uh
whoops the funny thing is I haven't
whoops the funny thing is I haven't
either on the code
side uh I
think I have to make a
new what did you do 128
yeah and
yeah and
then
then

size we do resample nearest

neighbor hard
neighbor hard
edges
okay that didn't work
it why the heck didn't that
it why the heck didn't that
work that looks garbage um it didn't
work that looks garbage um it didn't
upscale your pixel art
correctly I forget what it is I I just
correctly I forget what it is I I just
don't know what the setting is I thought
don't know what the setting is I thought
it was nearest neighbor hard edges but
it was nearest neighbor hard edges but
it's not doing an exact upscale I know
it's not doing an exact upscale I know
how to write the code for this I just
how to write the code for this I just
like I have to move it over to Linux and
like I have to move it over to Linux and
then like write a little script and
then like write a little script and
[Music]
[Music]
whatever right do you know how to do
whatever right do you know how to do
it I mean it's just like a it's just
it I mean it's just like a it's just
like a replace like every pixel with
like a replace like every pixel with
like four pixels type thing
like four pixels type thing
right yeah because these look so much
right yeah because these look so much
better than the
well this looks like it's
well this looks like it's
right but then whatever for whatever
right but then whatever for whatever
reason when I actually apply it it
reason when I actually apply it it
doesn't
work like the preview is correct but
work like the preview is correct but
then the actual thing is wrong
then the actual thing is wrong
done what did you do is it a Photoshop
done what did you do is it a Photoshop
setting or I guess you're an aspite
setting or I guess you're an aspite
right so you're not going to all right
right so you're not going to all right
oh yeah those are so much better I
oh yeah those are so much better I
actually now that I can see your work
actually now that I can see your work
full size this is way way
nicer cuz before I could only see like
nicer cuz before I could only see like
the shittily upscaled versions right so
the shittily upscaled versions right so
these are way way
these are way way
nicer do
nicer do
this we do
this we do
what do I send
these this
maybe okay
aspite is what is intended I
aspite is what is intended I
see I mean I hate all the Adobe stuff as
see I mean I hate all the Adobe stuff as
well it's just like it's kind of
well it's just like it's kind of
convenient having all the stuff in one
convenient having all the stuff in one
spot cuz like I use I started using like
spot cuz like I use I started using like
Premiere Pro for videos and then there's
Premiere Pro for videos and then there's
like illustrator I got Photoshop which I
like illustrator I got Photoshop which I
actually know how to use sort of like I
actually know how to use sort of like I
honestly hate all the Adobe [ __ ] though
honestly hate all the Adobe [ __ ] though
but it's like freaking
industry see users we're going to load
industry see users we're going to load
this artwork in
okay
so let's
so let's
do we have this gross UV map somewhere
do we have this gross UV map somewhere
in
here disgusting amount of shitty python
here disgusting amount of shitty python
code here
11 12 13
14 so wait
14 so wait
it's it's six
it's it's six
through 6 through 10 and 11 through
through 6 through 10 and 11 through
15 here this is what I do when I'm
15 here this is what I do when I'm
lazy CU I just
lazy CU I just
like can't be bothered remembering
things and then your artwork is
so 11 is support which one is supposed
so 11 is support which one is supposed
to be
Wich good do devs are
spoiled honestly I'm not tempted by any
spoiled honestly I'm not tempted by any
like I'm not really tempted by any of
like I'm not really tempted by any of
the engines
really like rib I'm way happier just
really like rib I'm way happier just
like building [ __ ] in SE and shipping
it or I guess most of my stuff's in scon
it or I guess most of my stuff's in scon
but same
but same
thing take that back look it's a great
thing take that back look it's a great
tool for game devs it's great for game
tool for game devs it's great for game
devs but like I don't want to write
devs but like I don't want to write
something in a script that's for that
something in a script that's for that
engine right I don't want to be writing
engine right I don't want to be writing
stuff in GD script it's only for a front
stuff in GD script it's only for a front
end anyways so like I'd have to come up
end anyways so like I'd have to come up
with packet logic to like get the SIM
with packet logic to like get the SIM
into the into that in the first place to
into the into that in the first place to
be able to do the front end I really
be able to do the front end I really
like
like
rayb with rust bindings I refuse to
rayb with rust bindings I refuse to
touch rust I do not touch rust one
touch rust I do not touch rust one
bit color coding Accord to your sim blue

tank
tank
okay so this is blue is tank so X is 128
okay so this is blue is tank so X is 128
I believe and then Y
is bindings for many so the thing that
is bindings for many so the thing that
I'm doing is a little bit weird though
I'm doing is a little bit weird though
cuz these aren't games that are just

Sim is a standalone that needs to run in

whatever language like C scon Python and

then like it's just the rendering and
then like it's just the rendering and
user controls that are done in the
user controls that are done in the
engine so it's much more decoupled than
engine so it's much more decoupled than
you would typic
see I don't know maybe it would make
see I don't know maybe it would make
stuff easier
stuff easier
but for now it's been pretty easy just
but for now it's been pretty easy just
writing my own stuff in
RB uh colorcoded blue blue is tank
RB uh colorcoded blue blue is tank
orange is burst
orange is burst
so I go to
here 256
here 256
256 and

then green is support which is up
here

384 well you don't you just don't have a
384 well you don't you just don't have a
red one right like you said oranges
burst oh wait why are there only
burst oh wait why are there only
four did I miss one
I think I missed one hold
on yeah I totally missed one my
on yeah I totally missed one my
bad my bad let me fix
that whoops working on a turn-based game
that whoops working on a turn-based game
right now in gdau adding AI opponents
right now in gdau adding AI opponents
using Python and rust fairly
using Python and rust fairly
straightforward if your code is clean
straightforward if your code is clean
depends what type of AI you're talking
depends what type of AI you're talking
about um if you want to do reinforcement
about um if you want to do reinforcement
learning and you want to do it
learning and you want to do it
effectively there are very specific
effectively there are very specific
considerations if you just mean like
considerations if you just mean like
classic scripts or stuff then yeah
classic scripts or stuff then yeah
that's pretty that's very very easy by
that's pretty that's very very easy by
comparison you can kind of do that in
whatever but yeah the um it's B
whatever but yeah the um it's B
basically it's the RL side is a whole
basically it's the RL side is a whole
different Beast
okay we
have I got to redo all these which is a
have I got to redo all these which is a
pain support
pain support
shrimp is in green which is 384 256
shrimp is in green which is 384 256
oh I can't but I can't see
oh I can't but I can't see
the hold
on okay so now it's we're on Row
three so support shrimp is
256 uh assassin is red
256 uh assassin is red
which is
256 burst
256 burst
is 128 256 and then
is 128 256 and then
tank is 0 to 56 and
tank is 0 to 56 and
then
assassin is three wait three
wait no this is carry
wait no this is carry
right yes which is
zero
zero
yes and then what we do is we
yes and then what we do is we
copy copy these and then we relabel
copy copy these and then we relabel
these to be

if you give me an art
Channel you can put it in gen would do

you want a
you want a
specific I find that the more channels

you add to discords like the just the
you add to discords like the just the
more garbage and like harder it is to

track stuff you can put stuff in gen and

if you post like you know so like if we

this
morning exter C
art is you design Dan okay fair
enough I can give you a roll or whatever
enough I can give you a roll or whatever
in the Discord if you want I need to
in the Discord if you want I need to
know if you care about
know if you care about
that obviously contributors get listed
that obviously contributors get listed
on the main page including

nonte uh
mod man
holy [ __ ] look at
holy [ __ ] look at
this uh I think that I need to the
this uh I think that I need to the
towers are
towers are
Knights let me fix
Knights let me fix
that let me fix the towers being
that let me fix the towers being
Knights uh
okay here we
okay here we
go this is with your art in
it this will yeah there you go though
that's
that's
sweet it's not going to look as good in
sweet it's not going to look as good in
as um you know it needs the animations I
as um you know it needs the animations I
think more so because like the puffers
think more so because like the puffers
you can kind of get away with not having
you can kind of get away with not having
them animated because they're kind of
them animated because they're kind of
just
Dopey like they're fish it would be
Dopey like they're fish it would be
better if even those
swam moving oh well the shrimp it has a
swam moving oh well the shrimp it has a
a move speed buff
a move speed buff
right so you can do
this and it also has like jump attack so
this and it also has like jump attack so
it can like do this you see like the
it can like do this you see like the
dash
AOE of course you're not very strong at
AOE of course you're not very strong at
the
start these fit way more than I thought
start these fit way more than I thought
that they would though I'll I'll give
that they would though I'll I'll give
you that like these fit way more than I
you that like these fit way more than I
thought that they would
thought that they would
they're kind of small on the
screen I I guess I'm on a 1440p monitor
screen I I guess I'm on a 1440p monitor
with no scaling up on this
but that's pretty
but that's pretty
sweet that's pretty
sweet are they there are these agents
sweet are they there are these agents
using neuronet models yeah of course
using neuronet models yeah of course
they all are hold on let me use a rest
they all are hold on let me use a rest
from real quick I'll be right back and
from real quick I'll be right back and
we'll keep uh we got another hour and a
we'll keep uh we got another hour and a
half of Devon Me Maybe maybe two we'll
see
e
e e
going to need that animation player
going to need that animation player
right
now you have an animation player that
now you have an animation player that
you can use yourself for Dev
you can use yourself for Dev
right I just need to tell you that the
right I just need to tell you that the
timings so let me give you this at the
timings so let me give you this at the
time being so right now um the way that
time being so right now um the way that
I have right now the one issue is that
like the frame ints are a little bit
like the frame ints are a little bit
weird because technically the way I'm
weird because technically the way I'm
doing it right now the animations are a
doing it right now the animations are a
maximum of. 2 seconds which is like way
maximum of. 2 seconds which is like way
too uh way way way too fast
too uh way way way too fast
um I'm going to be able to fix
um I'm going to be able to fix
that but I'm going to have to think
that but I'm going to have to think
about the animation system a little bit
about the animation system a little bit
and the reason for that is that the game
and the reason for that is that the game
ticks themselves are. 2 seconds so there
ticks themselves are. 2 seconds so there
are 12 frames in
are 12 frames in
between uh each game tick so like
between uh each game tick so like
technically yeah you can just slot the
technically yeah you can just slot the
12 animation like the set the animations
12 animation like the set the animations
and they're just going to be really
and they're just going to be really
really fast until I figure out how to
really fast until I figure out how to
slow stuff down right and spread the
slow stuff down right and spread the
animations
out and I'll make some cool animation
out and I'll make some cool animation
system
cool we've integrated these these are
awesome e
cool there you go your stuff is now
cool there you go your stuff is now
added to the MOBA
officially once we actually like put the
officially once we actually like put the
anms in properly and do some stuff you
anms in properly and do some stuff you
can feel free to DM me um however you
can feel free to DM me um however you
would like to be listed on the uh
would like to be listed on the uh
contributors page though I do those in
contributors page though I do those in
batches it's a little bit annoying to
batches it's a little bit annoying to
rebuild the
rebuild the
website I should fix that so it's just
website I should fix that so it's just
like readed from a txt or
something let's go back to the C code
something let's go back to the C code
maybe for a little bit unless you have
maybe for a little bit unless you have
other things to do with the art
other things to do with the art
immediately um how's the stream
immediately um how's the stream
doing very good cred ISM the job is done
doing very good cred ISM the job is done
fair
enough we're going to make some real
enough we're going to make some real
cool stuff here I'm going to leave your
cool stuff here I'm going to leave your
artwork up
artwork up
on we'll leave your artwork up here for

a bit on the

oops how do I let's make make this nicer

click there we go it's
cool I actually like the it's so hard to

tell initially that the it's got like

the puffer fish head but once you see it
the puffer fish head but once you see it
it's like it's so

no and there's a good reason for that so

infrastructure limitation that makes
infrastructure limitation that makes
them pretty clunky to work with uh but
them pretty clunky to work with uh but
the much bigger issue is just that
the much bigger issue is just that
they're slow and it's very very seldom
they're slow and it's very very seldom
Justified to put a model that slow into

more data with a smaller model like DOTA

didn't need a Transformer DOTA was

you the entire C++ programming

the angle bracket is a scyon thing I
think worse than rust but not as bad as

granted there are a couple C things I

still need to figure out how to do
when you write C++ sure but when you
when you write C++ sure but when you
write C you should spend zero time
write C you should spend zero time
thinking about that
in Star snake so this is an

weird freaking borrow check mechanic
weird freaking borrow check mechanic
that nobody asked

writing code for

it's very

because otherwise if you didn't have

issue that needs to be solved at the

language level but actually it's just
language level but actually it's just
solved at the compiler level and in fact
solved at the compiler level and in fact
you'll even get runtime checks for out
you'll even get runtime checks for out
of bounds and stuff so that's not a

either variable type SE snake is
either variable type SE snake is

I guess you can't
I guess you can't

huge yes if you
I hated C in undergrad I hated it was
I hated C in undergrad I hated it was

absolutely no ability to check array
bounds and like address like memory for

you is God awful but the thing is you
you is God awful but the thing is you
can solve it I like that you can solve
can solve it I like that you can solve
it at compile time uh and even runtime
it at compile time uh and even runtime
you can just compile with extra Flags
you can just compile with extra Flags
rather than having to like clunky your

programming language Right add a whole
programming language Right add a whole
bunch of Jank to the programming
bunch of Jank to the programming
language to do
it type python object
it type python object
really knit SE snake
okay these do return
pointers time to switch to Zig I looked
pointers time to switch to Zig I looked
at it thus far I haven't seen a need for
at it thus far I haven't seen a need for
it thus far I have not seen a need for
it thus far I have not seen a need for
Zig and it seems to add it seems to make
Zig and it seems to add it seems to make
C heavier which is
C heavier which is
like I don't want heavy
C like the number of features I want on
C like the number of features I want on
top of c are very small basically you
top of c are very small basically you
see this feature right here this feature
see this feature right here this feature
right here where you can have um easier

ways to manage like multi-dimensional

I'm happy all I want
I'm happy all I want
in fact if anybody knows a good way of

dealing with this type of data in C let
dealing with this type of data in C let
me know because this is the one thing
me know because this is the one thing
that's currently driving me crazy that I
that's currently driving me crazy that I
can do in scon but not in C like when I
can do in scon but not in C like when I
do this in C I have to I have to
do this in C I have to I have to
manually compute the indices for like
manually compute the indices for like
the flat arrays and it drives me nuts
the flat arrays and it drives me nuts
it's the only complaint I have
[Music]
[Music]
cannot select attribute of incomplete
cannot select attribute of incomplete
type SE
type SE
snake you have to do like
Arrow I don't know because it's yeah no
Arrow I don't know because it's yeah no
you can't do this in
scyon comp
scyon comp
time cross
compile yeah well that's true for C
wait if that's true B you can literally
wait if that's true B you can literally
use the zig build tool on C code
so honestly the r like the rust
so honestly the r like the rust
Community is just like the arch
Community is just like the arch
Community it's a bunch of technical
Community it's a bunch of technical
people who like really care about their
people who like really care about their
tools it's just like like is this really

the thing that you picked like was
the thing that you picked like was
memory safety the hill you wanted to die
memory safety the hill you wanted to die
on right like for Arch it's like was

rolling releases the hell you wanted to
rolling releases the hell you wanted to
die on really of all the problems you
die on really of all the problems you
could
solve I don't know about
solve I don't know about
that do you have to do a
zero
zero
cannot incomplete type sea snake is so
cannot incomplete type sea snake is so
weird
weird
one language to rule them
all I don't know C and python stack is
all I don't know C and python stack is
very
very
nice syon is really good if I could just
nice syon is really good if I could just
compile scon to web assembly like I'd
compile scon to web assembly like I'd
probably be set
but JavaScript uh please no
but JavaScript uh please no
please not
JavaScript you see that I'm writing C so
JavaScript you see that I'm writing C so
it can be on web this is because I
it can be on web this is because I
prefer to write C that to uh
JavaScript it would literally rather
JavaScript it would literally rather
write C than JavaScript
what do you use to compile the web
what do you use to compile the web
assembly M
scripton apparently there's now uh there
scripton apparently there's now uh there
might be native support
now WM
now WM
no uh m scripton
I'm also sick of the scon build times
there the other motive for this
e probably I could figure out a way to
e probably I could figure out a way to
speed them
speed them
up yeah they're a bit slow because you
up yeah they're a bit slow because you
have to transpile like it makes a 30,000
have to transpile like it makes a 30,000
line C file and then compiles that which
line C file and then compiles that which
is really obnoxious
I'm just going to paste errors into this
I'm just going to paste errors into this
because this is literally just me not
because this is literally just me not
knowing
docks oops
oh I'm just
oh I'm just
dumb this is like python rot
brain there we
brain there we
go uh maybe not wait
RB oh it needs theh
file need the H
file need the H
file does it not have the H file
just doesn't have the do h
this is the one other obnoxious thing
this is the one other obnoxious thing
with
with
the
the
path you have to
export what's this stupid I'm still not
export what's this stupid I'm still not
used to end
used to end
variables give me export
variables give me export
command for
if this thing decides not to respond I
if this thing decides not to respond I
deserve it for because I should really
deserve it for because I should really
just do this
this is where it is right rb.
yeah I see
it did I do that wrong
my lab
really
I'll fix that in a second I'll be right
I'll fix that in a second I'll be right
back restro real
back restro real
quick
see
e
e e
all
all
right hello
folks so what we're doing briefly is we
folks so what we're doing briefly is we
are we have a scyon version of a snake
are we have a scyon version of a snake
environment originally written in Python
environment originally written in Python
and then I also orted it to
and then I also orted it to
C um so now what I'm trying to do is I'm
C um so now what I'm trying to do is I'm
trying to see if I can get uh an easy
trying to see if I can get uh an easy
way to make bindings for this
way to make bindings for this
environment to python
environment to python
uh not just for the snake environment
uh not just for the snake environment
the point here is currently that there's
the point here is currently that there's
a bunch of Jank that occurs for API
a bunch of Jank that occurs for API
compatibility for integration between
compatibility for integration between
Python and lower level stuff and I'm
Python and lower level stuff and I'm
using this s en as an
using this s en as an
opportunity to see if I can make stuff
opportunity to see if I can make stuff
simpler and easier to work with and if I
simpler and easier to work with and if I
can that's going to enable us to do some
can that's going to enable us to do some
lower level stuff with the mooba lower
lower level stuff with the mooba lower
level stuff with other M's and to to not
level stuff with other M's and to to not
have such a bad time of all of it so
have such a bad time of all of it so
that's what we're looking at at the
that's what we're looking at at the
moment and yeah let's keep figuring this
moment and yeah let's keep figuring this
out of course this does involve uh a
out of course this does involve uh a
number of just silly errors like me not
number of just silly errors like me not
being able to compile stuff what OS is
being able to compile stuff what OS is
this this is technically windows but not
this this is technically windows but not
really because this is all running in
really because this is all running in
WSL which is a bunto but it's inside of
WSL which is a bunto but it's inside of
a Docker container which is also a bunto
a Docker container which is also a bunto
the docker container is puffer tank and
the docker container is puffer tank and
you can kind of just put that on
you can kind of just put that on
whatever machine and always have this
whatever machine and always have this
exact exact same Dev
environment that's what this
is so technically this is puffer
tank ra. H why is this
not am I including this from the long
not am I including this from the long
the wrong spot
oh yeah I am including it from the wrong
oh yeah I am including it from the wrong
spot l
still
no okay now I'm
no okay now I'm
confused the path right environments
confused the path right environments

[Music]
amd64 um
is there just more stuff that I have to
is there just more stuff that I have to
pass that I'm not
realizing probably
right uh I could
thing is if I compile it as a standalone
thing is if I compile it as a standalone
it gets
annoying it gets really annoying if I
annoying it gets really annoying if I
try to compile it as a
standalone CU then I can't trigger
standalone CU then I can't trigger
rebuild
oh did I mess up my library
path I think I just messed up the
path I think I just messed up the
library path let me just open a
library path let me just open a
new
terminal so there you asked about what
terminal so there you asked about what
I'm using there you go so from WSL
I'm using there you go so from WSL
starts the tank and then I have my nice
starts the tank and then I have my nice
uh my nice container with all my stuff
uh my nice container with all my stuff
in
it okay
okay there we go
how does it
work
ah that is
ah that is
different appears to
work did the snake environment compile
incompatible pointer
type well we'll see what's uh whether
type well we'll see what's uh whether
this messes up or
not under Define symbol and
drawing undefined symbol and
drawing this is just like the last one
drawing this is just like the last one
in the file right
sh jeez how many freaking twitch Bots
sh jeez how many freaking twitch Bots
are there that's
are there that's
ridiculous it's like two a
day Linker couldn't
find oh okay so you can do
maybe
maybe
this maybe I have to modify the setup
do
extension forces equal
I that get
include
RB Five Point
okay
I like how it thinks C++ for some dumb
reason right set up
tools
tools
okay so does this do it
uh there is nice size
uh there is nice size
snake environements
snake environements
ocean
snake I don't know why I did it with
snake I don't know why I did it with
dots that was that's
bizarre okay
and then we run the
demo still undefined
symbol but hold on we're probably doing
symbol but hold on we're probably doing
something screwy from here
right from SI snake import snake
and then undefined symbol end
drawing why
let's recompile let me make sure it's
let's recompile let me make sure it's
actually
compiling appears to be
do we get compile error
somewhere
struct assignment to se snake from
struct assignment to se snake from
incompatible pointers type sne snake
incompatible pointers type sne snake
star
I'm pie
if a stru does not type deft
thought it was type
thought it was type
Deft it is type deft
let me see
R SE
R SE
snake struct
renderer is it like SE struck or
renderer is it like SE struck or
something weird
ah but if they were not correctly
linked reset takes
linked reset takes
see snake
star this is exactly what it was
before no discernable
differences incompatible pointer
type so this is like not getting defined
type so this is like not getting defined
correctly
correctly
[Music]
somehow what wait this is like is there
somehow what wait this is like is there
supposed to be a valid error message
supposed to be a valid error message
here because it's like The Arrow is not
here because it's like The Arrow is not
lining up
invalid assignment from incompatible
invalid assignment from incompatible
pointer
type why is this carrot right here is it
type why is this carrot right here is it
supposed to be
oh jeez I can't tell where this is
oh jeez I can't tell where this is
supposed to
be
stupid but one of these pams looks
stupid but one of these pams looks
wrong about a
wrong about a
line and a bit
line and a bit
in
in
so probably like herish with height Max
so probably like herish with height Max
selang
selang
something like
something like
that say
width

[Music]
Len let me make sure that this is the

in Max snake
Lang unsigned in

Star rewards view is a float
star then do I call all these with
star then do I call all these with
[Music]
[Music]
with the right views yes I
do man this is so weird I
can't assignment to type struct
wait this is totally the type def thing
wait this is totally the type def thing
isn't
it is this valid is this like valid can
it is this valid is this like valid can
you do this
okay well apparently
let me take this one out for now I think
let me take this one out for now I think
that this will be good but not
yet okay so this was the one that was
yet okay so this was the one that was
buggy and now type dstruct
buggy and now type dstruct
syntax error
do I need to do
like okay hold
like okay hold
on we're going to find
this assignment two
was right up here
was right up here
somewhere assignment to struct se snake
somewhere assignment to struct se snake
star from incompatible pointer SE snake
star from incompatible pointer SE snake
star
okay so this thinks that this is a
okay so this thinks that this is a
struct instead of a type dat struct is
struct instead of a type dat struct is
it like a c struct or
something is this actually for freaking
something is this actually for freaking
it are you got to be kidding me does
it are you got to be kidding me does
this now
work that's so [ __ ]
work that's so [ __ ]
obnoxious apparently there is a keyword
obnoxious apparently there is a keyword
which is C type
death that you need if you're going to
death that you need if you're going to
bind to a type def struct instead of a
bind to a type def struct instead of a
normal struct I
normal struct I
guess g
okay so we still have this undefined
okay so we still have this undefined
symbol but this now
symbol but this now
compiles this now compiles cleanly at
least isn't learning
least isn't learning
fun yeah I'm having so much fun
stupid undefined symbol and drawing okay
stupid undefined symbol and drawing okay
so this is like a link [ __ ]
thing right so this is why I was trying
thing right so this is why I was trying
to define the extension
is it like Dash L rib do I need to pass
is it like Dash L rib do I need to pass
this
um do I need to pass all the rib
Flags there a lot of them
right e
about
this do I
this do I
see uh I don't see the flags being added
see uh I don't see the flags being added
here
I don't see the
flags I don't see elrb I don't see any
flags I don't see elrb I don't see any
of the flags I just
of the flags I just
specified so I'm guessing this is not
specified so I'm guessing this is not
going to work because the flags weren't
going to work because the flags weren't
used
yeah why don't these get used
I guess this is where I start trying to
build this extension so I can explicitly
build this extension so I can explicitly
link uh all the stuff that I need for
link uh all the stuff that I need for
this
dash
dash well hold on weird to have these
dash well hold on weird to have these
these two syntax
next
this oh there's the elrb
this oh there's the elrb
it got added
now still
no look right here we got all of our
flags building SI snake extension
remove
this okay so now it can set it up
this okay so now it can set it up
again
again
[Music]
copying right
copying right
there I think this is the one it
there I think this is the one it
wants let me try something
ah this one
ah this one
works this one I believe
works
so it's just compiling to the wrong spot
so it's just compiling to the wrong spot
let me look that
up but we figured it
up but we figured it
out and actually if I can do this then
out and actually if I can do this then
this will be really nice to
have 713 I got to hurry this up though
have 713 I got to hurry this up though
because I'm getting hungry
for for
it's obnoxious
okay
okay now we can
open uh SE snake
open uh SE snake
pi and we can see what's wrong with this
so this is what we're calling it
with this is what we're calling it with
with this is what we're calling it with
and then this is the signature it's
and then this is the signature it's
expecting grid snakes observation
expecting grid snakes observation
lengths pointers
lengths pointers
lifetimes colors actions rewards food

Vision snake length corpse food Corpse
Vision snake length corpse food Corpse
Death um that is weird because this
Death um that is weird because this
looks correct to
looks correct to
me let's see
why snake in nit takes from
one to 13 positional arguments is that
correct one two three four five six
correct one two three four five six
seven8
seven8
10 16 no it definitely takes
um definitely take 17
and wait
and wait
snake in a reset
yeah this is definitely correct and then
yeah this is definitely correct and then
it comes from s snake
here oh maybe
I might have uh I might
I might have uh I might
have gotten something wrong
here let's try
build building the extension
and where did it build
to not
there it show me
these are
these are
copies this one
built SI
snake. o
oh wait build
temp
wait build lib
okay so it's just not respecting the
okay so it's just not respecting the
output directory right
so that time it flashed the uh the
so that time it flashed the uh the
renderer up on the screen like a blank
canvas something's very weird with these
canvas something's very weird with these
extensions
I'm trying to think how I want to do
I'm trying to think how I want to do
this
it's not respecting the
oh it just I don't know where it did
oh it just I don't know where it did
with
my wait runtime Library
dur it's just not it's this ARG is not
dur it's just not it's this ARG is not
good I guess it's not doing anything
good I guess it's not doing anything
with this
this build file is so [ __ ]
this is the right way isn't
this is the right way isn't
it yeah this is the right
way but wait if I do it this way
h
oh that's stupid
oh that's stupid
I'll try specifying the package
location but I don't I don't understand
location but I don't I don't understand
this thing I don't understand why the
this thing I don't understand why the
hell it's like
this it should find the package
here why is it like
here why is it like
this like seriously why does scyon eyes
this like seriously why does scyon eyes
behave different
behave different
when
you when you specify it one way versus
you when you specify it one way versus
the
other let me comment this as well
man like why is it like
this I'm getting really hungry I'm going
this I'm getting really hungry I'm going
to order food I'm going to keep working
to order food I'm going to keep working
on this though until food gets here
I really hate
Packaging
e e
okay it's
okay it's
there let me figure this out me to
there let me figure this out me to
Christmas is the
Christmas is the
worst
worst
um I'm just the thing like I'm not sure
is having to compile this through scon
is having to compile this through scon
and the like through pip in the first
and the like through pip in the first
place is
place is
dumb
um we should just be able to build this
um we should just be able to build this
and freaking import it
no not
this e
you must declare them yourself isn't
you must declare them yourself isn't
that just
stupid like why do you need to redefine
stupid like why do you need to redefine
something that already has a static
something that already has a static
definition
I mean regardless
though do I need to link is this what I
though do I need to link is this what I
need to do do I need to compile it
separately then I'm still going to have
separately then I'm still going to have
the problem with this stupid extension
the problem with this stupid extension
thing I hate this like setup tools
thing I hate this like setup tools
extension because it like it screws up
extension because it like it screws up
where it puts the build
where it puts the build
files hey JBL I'm trying to figure out
files hey JBL I'm trying to figure out
how to like I'm trying to fix us up some
how to like I'm trying to fix us up some
infra so that we can have like nice ways
infra so that we can have like nice ways
of dealing with all these different
of dealing with all these different
environments and I'm even trying to
environments and I'm even trying to
increase interoperability with C but I'm
increase interoperability with C but I'm
just getting stuck on like compiling
just getting stuck on like compiling
stuff correctly here and it's such a
stuff correctly here and it's such a
pain in the ass
I'm also starving so food should be here
I'm also starving so food should be here
soon
but like what the
heck maybe I can do this as the C
heck maybe I can do this as the C
extension
and
then e
I'm just so conf confused as to how this
I'm just so conf confused as to how this
is supposed to
work yeah the funny thing is like this
work yeah the funny thing is like this
is all python just being a pain in the
is all python just being a pain in the
ass the C is easy isn't that [ __ ] that
ass the C is easy isn't that [ __ ] that
like the python build system for this is
like the python build system for this is
the thing that's the problem the C build
the thing that's the problem the C build
is

occasionally we end up just fighting

low-level Shenanigans here um but this
low-level Shenanigans here um but this
is what's required to get this stuff to

work so what I'm trying to figure out
work so what I'm trying to figure out
how to do now is I'm trying to make a
how to do now is I'm trying to make a
nice way to have like really complex and
nice way to have like really complex and
interesting M's that can be written in C
interesting M's that can be written in C

nice with puffer lib really really fast
nice with puffer lib really really fast
we have all this working at the moment
we have all this working at the moment
in scyon we have it separately working
in scyon we have it separately working
in C but there's just a lot of overhead
in C but there's just a lot of overhead

all the stuff from neural MMO was fine
all the stuff from neural MMO was fine
and correct it's just like it needed to
and correct it's just like it needed to
be implemented faster is all it is
be implemented faster is all it is
python is just too slow for something
python is just too slow for something
like that that was the main issue there
like that that was the main issue there
were a few other design things with
were a few other design things with
neural MMO that really held the project
neural MMO that really held the project
back that I had no way of knowing I
back that I had no way of knowing I
don't think anybody knew back then um
don't think anybody knew back then um
there's more stuff for neural MMO that
there's more stuff for neural MMO that
will be coming as well uh and more
will be coming as well uh and more
generally like lots of stuff for complex
generally like lots of stuff for complex
Sims we're already like a 100 to a
Sims we're already like a 100 to a
thousand times faster than any of the
thousand times faster than any of the
stuff I did in my thesis and just three
stuff I did in my thesis and just three
months later so things are moving way
months later so things are moving way
way way faster now I'm out of
Academia oh I think I see
maybe this is still going to put the
maybe this is still going to put the
damn code in the wrong directory though
we have lots more um lots more stuff
we have lots more um lots more stuff
coming as well with um simulators in
coming as well with um simulators in
fact we're now have we've gotten to the
fact we're now have we've gotten to the
point where it's easy enough that many
point where it's easy enough that many
viewers are starting to look at like
viewers are starting to look at like
building M's and stuff for puffer and
building M's and stuff for puffer and
it's relatively straightforward to do
it's relatively straightforward to do
and it's only getting easier so like
and it's only getting easier so like
right now things like uh arcade game
right now things like uh arcade game
level are pretty easy to build um I'm
level are pretty easy to build um I'm
building stuff like you know the MOBA
building stuff like you know the MOBA
I'm building all sorts of other Sims but
I'm building all sorts of other Sims but
uh soon it's going to be easier for
uh soon it's going to be easier for
people to do that type of stuff as
people to do that type of stuff as
well and just to get a few of the issues
well and just to get a few of the issues
out of here
oh this is snake game
shouldn't this be snake.

I I have not actually seen these
interesting that looks cool though
is it that o
you can actually encode symmetries in
you can actually encode symmetries in
matter conservation okay that's
matter conservation okay that's
interesting
interesting
that's very
interesting Material Science looking to
interesting Material Science looking to
simplify complex models with
simplify complex models with
ML rarely does ML simplify things but
ML rarely does ML simplify things but
sometimes those look interesting I
sometimes those look interesting I
hadn't I don't know I haven't seen
hadn't I don't know I haven't seen
uh I haven't seen those
okay what
should be lib
snake. looks like jbl's seen him
a r r CS
what Dash o
oh you have to do that's
weird snake doso
do you have to re-include everything
do you have to re-include everything
like
that a r r
that a r r
CS for
I mean this isn't going to work for me
I mean this isn't going to work for me
either I need a local
build for
oh you can do it in one
oh you can do it in one
step you can apparently do it in one
step you can apparently do it in one
step with clang very nice
what
what
um does this need to have something else
can command
can command
Flags Okay uh there's lib snake.
Soo there's lib lib snake.
Soo there's lib lib snake.
Soo
Soo
so where's food hold
so where's food hold
on food is here in roughly 10 minutes or
so I'm going to see how if I can make
so I'm going to see how if I can make
any progress on this but uh
any progress on this but uh
likely we'll have to pick this up next
likely we'll have to pick this up next
week and I'm going to be grinding on the
week and I'm going to be grinding on the
the video as much as I can over the
the video as much as I can over the
weekend see if I can get close to
weekend see if I can get close to
finishing that that's really got to be
finishing that that's really got to be
done
done
soon main
thing e
you link against the doso
Li snake
Li snake
here this just has to be Library
here this just has to be Library
snake right
does this actually work here if this
does this actually work here if this
works this would be
works this would be
amazing I don't think it will
cuz I hate this extension thing
cuz I hate this extension thing
here it's just really obnoxious it like
here it's just really obnoxious it like
doesn't work ever
then we just take this extension
then we just take this extension
here put this up here just in case we
here put this up here just in case we
need
it we uncomment the SI snake
so unknown option extra compile args
so unknown option extra compile args
building SI
snake do we have L snake in
here
snake. anyone here have experience with
snake. anyone here have experience with
NCA make ruce models in certain
NCA make ruce models in certain
applications
there's some aive people I know that do
there's some aive people I know that do
um this is a really cool
project Kevin
project Kevin
prance this is a really cool
project runs really fast e
he really undersold it here this is not
he really undersold it here this is not
an order of magnitude faster it's like a
an order of magnitude faster it's like a
ton of orders of magnitude faster
is that a falling sandim yeah kind of
I'm not seeing the uh the linked Library
I'm not seeing the uh the linked Library
here so I think it's not linking my
here so I think it's not linking my
library
correctly yeah it's a fair bit more
so
so
interestingly we still get the undefined
interestingly we still get the undefined
symbol
issue this seg faults well you can't do
issue this seg faults well you can't do
that with a shared library right I'm
that with a shared library right I'm
going to have to like take some time to
going to have to like take some time to
really understand the build system here
really understand the build system here
both the C build system and how it
both the C build system and how it
interacts with python
interacts with python
unfortunately um I guess in the meantime
unfortunately um I guess in the meantime
we can take a quick look
we can take a quick look
at our train
at our train
runs which we'll pick back
runs which we'll pick back
up uh next
week so we have this one and we have
week so we have this one and we have
this one
this one
right so for Space
right so for Space
Invaders oh it's actually it's starting
Invaders oh it's actually it's starting
to take off a little bit you can
to take off a little bit you can
see I think we'll get some uh some
see I think we'll get some uh some
better runs than this we still have
better runs than this we still have
another 200 experiments to go uh the
another 200 experiments to go uh the
slope is not the best here you'd think
slope is not the best here you'd think
it would find some better stuff but you
it would find some better stuff but you
never know and
never know and
then here we are at 2168 ELO
then here we are at 2168 ELO
so looks like it found a slightly better
so looks like it found a slightly better
one than before this is a nicer shape to
one than before this is a nicer shape to
it looks like we will have some nice
it looks like we will have some nice
Bots for the MOA at least so that is
Bots for the MOA at least so that is
good to
good to
know but yeah I'm going to
know but yeah I'm going to
be man as soon as I finish this video
be man as soon as I finish this video
the dev speed is going to pick back up a
the dev speed is going to pick back up a
ton because I'm just I'm losing so many
ton because I'm just I'm losing so many
hours a week to having to do this stuff
and I really want to have I need more
and I really want to have I need more
time in the week
time in the week
because I usually have like an off
because I usually have like an off
stream day a week where I'll just like
stream day a week where I'll just like
try to figure out some like kind of this
try to figure out some like kind of this
type of stuff which is really boring to
type of stuff which is really boring to
watch and I haven't been able to do that
watch and I haven't been able to do that
so I've had to do a little of it on
so I've had to do a little of it on
stream but it's really not
great so yeah I'm hoping that soon uh
great so yeah I'm hoping that soon uh
I'll just finish this video and we'll be
I'll just finish this video and we'll be
set there but
set there but
anyways um if you haven't seen this
anyways um if you haven't seen this

otherwise I will see you next week
otherwise I will see you next week
thanks everyone

Kind: captions
Language: en
okay we should be
live
live
yeah there we
yeah there we
go how's it
going we've got some stuff to do today
let's
start with looking at some
start with looking at some
experiments I'm on quite late
experiments I'm on quite late
today goal is to
today goal is to
do 3ish showers maybe three a shower
do 3ish showers maybe three a shower
stream uh and we're going to do some
stream uh and we're going to do some
work on the mooba maybe some work on
work on the mooba maybe some work on
some other ends and a bunch of stuff hey
some other ends and a bunch of stuff hey
linky how's it going
okay no new runs on Saturday it
okay no new runs on Saturday it
says let's see what we
says let's see what we
have going on
here screwed up my hand a little bit
we should have two
we should have two
sweeps number one number
two Space Invaders
here is getting better we're going to
here is getting better we're going to
see if it how long it takes maybe it
see if it how long it takes maybe it
should be able to figure something
should be able to figure something
better out
better out
eventually we'll run for a while
and look at that perfect
and look at that perfect
timing we have a nice 2.1k
timing we have a nice 2.1k
ELO set of
ELO set of
parameters so I guess what we're going
parameters so I guess what we're going
to do is we're going to look at these
to do is we're going to look at these
set these as defaults train this
set these as defaults train this
model and hopefully that will give us a
model and hopefully that will give us a
nice new policy to play with
nice new policy to play with
we'll do some other stuff on the
we'll do some other stuff on the
environment today few other
environment today few other
things we be
good mainly though this will be
good mainly though this will be
a few hours just to get a little bit of
a few hours just to get a little bit of
Dev in um and then the main thing I'd be
Dev in um and then the main thing I'd be
working on this weekend is finally
working on this weekend is finally
finishing that video that will just free
finishing that video that will just free
up a lot of mental band
up a lot of mental band
with I don't know if I'll be able to
with I don't know if I'll be able to
finish it this weekend either it's a lot
finish it this weekend either it's a lot
of work it's a lot a lot of work
of work it's a lot a lot of work
I got
I got
um the final like camera footage for
um the final like camera footage for
that I'm going to have to
that I'm going to have to
get I'm waiting until Sunday I got I
get I'm waiting until Sunday I got I
bought some lighting set up and I'm
bought some lighting set up and I'm
going to hopefully be able to film that
going to hopefully be able to film that
in here we'll
in here we'll
see um but yeah it's it's like a pretty
see um but yeah it's it's like a pretty
extensive I it's like a 20 minute
extensive I it's like a 20 minute
script to have to do uh to go through
script to have to do uh to go through
right pretty well
oh look there are all of our stats This
oh look there are all of our stats This
Is
Good
Good
Hat okay these are our policies here
um we actually might want to train this
um we actually might want to train this
locally because we're not going to
locally because we're not going to
really need to mess up this sweep yeah
really need to mess up this sweep yeah
we'll train this locally for now that'll
we'll train this locally for now that'll
be
better hey bet
welcome got start docker
cool
we are setting hyper parameters to these
we are setting hyper parameters to these
ones which apparently are
ones which apparently are
good I'm a little bit concerned how low
good I'm a little bit concerned how low
the death reward uh how like small the
the death reward uh how like small the
death penalty
death penalty
is I guess it wasn't huge to begin
is I guess it wasn't huge to begin
with but uh I mean I guess I could buy
with but uh I mean I guess I could buy
it
it
what's the XP
what's the XP
reward very
reward very
low Tower reward is
low Tower reward is
high and then distance reward is 0.0
high and then distance reward is 0.0
because that's what we set this to be we
because that's what we set this to be we
wanted it to not be uh constrained
wanted it to not be uh constrained
by having to
by having to
rush
rush
basically and let's see the other prams
basically and let's see the other prams
batch size is the same BPT Horizon of 16
batch size is the same BPT Horizon of 16
is
is
good checkpoint in LEL
good checkpoint in LEL
50 clip
coefficient where is this it goes from
coefficient where is this it goes from
o0 point that's a very low clip
o0 point that's a very low clip
coefficient uh
coefficient uh
entropy very low
entropy yeah very low entropy
reasonable
Lambda very reasonable
Lambda very reasonable
Lambda uh slightly
Lambda uh slightly
low oops did I just do that backwards
low oops did I just do that backwards
yes I did uh slightly low gamma but
yes I did uh slightly low gamma but
higher than before is probably trending
higher than before is probably trending
in the correct
in the correct
direction uh learning rate goes
direction uh learning rate goes
substantially
substantially
lower probably a good thing and then Max
lower probably a good thing and then Max
grad Norm uh also gets
grad Norm uh also gets
lowered mini batch size stays the
same okay the value function
same okay the value function
coefficients are actually like kind of
coefficients are actually like kind of
reasonable which is nice to
reasonable which is nice to
see that's the clip
see that's the clip
coefficient so the clip is very
coefficient so the clip is very
low uh and then the value function
low uh and then the value function
coefficient
coefficient
is kind kind of reasonable
is kind kind of reasonable
here and that's
here and that's
it and how long did this train for
232 we're actually going to use the
232 we're actually going to use the
exact number just because
stability okay
MOBA mode train VC
MOBA mode train VC
multiprocessing
track
Baseline uh I probably should
just should do this just in case yeah
just should do this just in case yeah
it's
fine going here
and there we
and there we
go so whoops I guess this we have to
go so whoops I guess this we have to
leave this up in the background I'll
leave this up in the background I'll
just move
this I will just move this onto whoops
this I will just move this onto whoops
the other
screen working on hold on let me pull
screen working on hold on let me pull
the chat so I can see it working
the chat so I can see it working
on making spaces default policy faster
on making spaces default policy faster
for non
for non
ulated testing shows very slightly loss
ulated testing shows very slightly loss
some yeah well you have checks in the uh
some yeah well you have checks in the uh
the forward pass
basically
basically
1K I don't know if it's 1K of how many
1K I don't know if it's 1K of how many
if it's even statistically
if it's even statistically
significant but yeah generally you want
significant but yeah generally you want
to avoid doing stuff in the forward
to avoid doing stuff in the forward
pass that's like every
pass that's like every
conditional every Loop
conditional every Loop
I'm trying to think what I want to even
I'm trying to think what I want to even
do today because I uh the main thing I
do today because I uh the main thing I
had in my head was getting the video
had in my head was getting the video
stuff done and I made some decent
stuff done and I made some decent
progress on
progress on
it there's a lot of stuff we can do I'm
it there's a lot of stuff we can do I'm
trying to think if it's time to start
trying to think if it's time to start
thinking about data structures in the
thinking about data structures in the
MOBA or if there things that
MOBA or if there things that
initially I still need to do on
this it is less
Okay
Okay
so start a stream I guess uh yeah see
so start a stream I guess uh yeah see
you in a few hours but I guess I'm gonna
you in a few hours but I guess I'm gonna
at the start here I might as well talk
at the start here I might as well talk
through uh some of my thoughts
through uh some of my thoughts
on the environment stuff with
on the environment stuff with
puffer
puffer
so there are a few issues at the moment
so there are a few issues at the moment
right there's kind of a lot of
right there's kind of a lot of
boilerplate for each environment just
boilerplate for each environment just
because of matching the puffer
because of matching the puffer
API um the clients are really fast to
API um the clients are really fast to
write in puffer I mean in uh in Python
write in puffer I mean in uh in Python
but they're not super
but they're not super
performant uh we also
performant uh we also
have the Sims themselves like the grid
have the Sims themselves like the grid
system or whatever is kind of reused
system or whatever is kind of reused
everywhere and there are a bunch of bugs
everywhere and there are a bunch of bugs
that come up from um interacting with
that come up from um interacting with
the grid system and like leaving ghosts
the grid system and like leaving ghosts
on the field or
whatever so I think that
whatever so I think that
there's probably a reasonably easy way
there's probably a reasonably easy way
to make I don't want to say like a full
to make I don't want to say like a full
engine because I actually really like
engine because I actually really like
stuff like all this stuff working just
stuff like all this stuff working just
from scratch but maybe like the grid
from scratch but maybe like the grid
itself can be a component or
itself can be a component or
something
something
um yeah there's like some there are a
um yeah there's like some there are a
few like structural things I think that
few like structural things I think that
could be made easier across these
could be made easier across these
various different
various different
environments uh the other thing is it
environments uh the other thing is it
does annoy me not having these things be
does annoy me not having these things be
like runnable on web and not having like
like runnable on web and not having like
the debug tools right not having like a
the debug tools right not having like a
basic debugger that plays nicely the
basic debugger that plays nicely the
scon one looks okay but it's not really
scon one looks okay but it's not really
what I want
um I at the same time I'm like do I
um I at the same time I'm like do I
really want to just start porting all
really want to just start porting all
these different Sims to
these different Sims to
see is that the way to go
let's think about this what's left in
let's think about this what's left in
the MOBA that I haven't implemented
the MOBA that I haven't implemented
feature-wise
that I actually want to
implement like maybe we want to add some
implement like maybe we want to add some
sort of vision
sort of vision
control
maybe
um we have the abilities they're easy to
balance I mean really at this point it
balance I mean really at this point it
just needs to look a little
just needs to look a little
nicer we need to see what strategies can
nicer we need to see what strategies can
be learned on
be learned on
it and clean it up a bit like we can
it and clean it up a bit like we can
potentially add Vision later but pretty
potentially add Vision later but pretty
much we have all the core stuff I wanted
much we have all the core stuff I wanted
with this
I wouldn't mind doing a little bit
crunchier systems work
today I think it's a it's not a bad time
today I think it's a it's not a bad time
honestly for us to just like cuz I mean
honestly for us to just like cuz I mean
logistically I'm only going to have like
logistically I'm only going to have like
three or so hours today to play with
three or so hours today to play with
some stuff I might be starting more Sims
some stuff I might be starting more Sims
next week I have existing
next week I have existing
Sims uh outside of this mooba that like
Sims uh outside of this mooba that like
also need to be finalized and Polished
also need to be finalized and Polished
up and their main things that bother me
up and their main things that bother me
are just a little bit of Jank around
are just a little bit of Jank around
like General API and
like General API and
stuff
stuff
and a bit of stuff about the data
and a bit of stuff about the data
structures I'd
say yeah I'm trying think if this is the
say yeah I'm trying think if this is the
highest priority thing with puffer at
highest priority thing with puffer at
the moment and I think that outside
the moment and I think that outside
of the video it kind of is like making
of the video it kind of is like making
these environments really good really
these environments really good really
stable really performant and really easy
stable really performant and really easy
to use and
to use and
run is kind of the most important
thing the only thing that really gives
thing the only thing that really gives
me a pause at all is the fact that I've
me a pause at all is the fact that I've
basically told viewers like yeah go
basically told viewers like yeah go
ahead and just Implement stuff in cython
ahead and just Implement stuff in cython
and that is correct like there is no
and that is correct like there is no
performance reason to not just do stuff
performance reason to not just do stuff
in scyon and for most devs it's going to
in scyon and for most devs it's going to
be
be
easier and I think even for me it'll be
easier and I think even for me it'll be
easier maybe what I should do at the
easier maybe what I should do at the
moment you know what would be cool why
moment you know what would be cool why
don't we go to the snake end for a bit
don't we go to the snake end for a bit
which is uh the sea snake en and see if
which is uh the sea snake en and see if
I can figure out ways to
I can figure out ways to
like fix the little pieces that bother
like fix the little pieces that bother
me with how I had to implement that like
me with how I had to implement that like
the things that I had to do and see that
the things that I had to do and see that
I would have had easier in scon as well
I would have had easier in scon as well
as like the bindings to python let me
as like the bindings to python let me
see if I can like make that project
see if I can like make that project
really clean and
really clean and
simple
because if I can make that if I can get
because if I can make that if I can get
that project to the point where I'm
that project to the point where I'm
satisfied that
it's like uh as minimal as it can
it's like uh as minimal as it can
be then I think from there it would be
be then I think from there it would be
quite easy to move more stuff to C and
quite easy to move more stuff to C and
the other nice thing is you can
the other nice thing is you can
technically even do it
technically even do it
incrementally
incrementally
because yeah you can technically even do
because yeah you can technically even do
things
things
incrementally because syon can import C
incrementally because syon can import C
files right so I can just start like
files right so I can just start like
putting utilities and stuff into C
putting utilities and stuff into C
and like making sure with the Moa stuff
and like making sure with the Moa stuff
is good I can probably incrementally
Port probably wouldn't be that
hard okay well I mean I think that
hard okay well I mean I think that
people generally like the low-l stuff
people generally like the low-l stuff
and um I mean not as much as me screwing
and um I mean not as much as me screwing
around with Graphics right but unless we
around with Graphics right but unless we
have folks like actively looking at the
have folks like actively looking at the
graphics with me and helping on stuff I
graphics with me and helping on stuff I
think I'm going to look spend a little
think I'm going to look spend a little
bit of time looking at these for now uh
bit of time looking at these for now uh
the one thing though before I do that
the one thing though before I do that
is it would be really nice to get GPU
is it would be really nice to get GPU
Drive stuff
Drive stuff
working but I kind of have other
working but I kind of have other
experiments going at the moment and
experiments going at the moment and
we're sort of Hardware capped so I might
we're sort of Hardware capped so I might
leave that for a few more
leave that for a few more
days
days
yeah I I want to do this for now because
yeah I I want to do this for now because
this kind of affects my for how I'm
this kind of affects my for how I'm
going to do stuff in the future
going to do stuff in the future
and um the the video is going to be
and um the the video is going to be
taking basically all my other mental
taking basically all my other mental
bandwidth uh over the weekend um I'm
bandwidth uh over the weekend um I'm
hoping I actually can record at least a
hoping I actually can record at least a
few of the final clips for that over the
few of the final clips for that over the
weekend
weekend
but I'm not confident I'll be able to do
but I'm not confident I'll be able to do
that I only get the camera the camera
that I only get the camera the camera
equipment on Sunday I don't know what
equipment on Sunday I don't know what
time
time
so basically before then I'm going to be
so basically before then I'm going to be
going through the script refining it
going through the script refining it
practicing it
practicing it
and doing other basic video editing
and doing other basic video editing
things
things
okay let's start on let's start on a few
okay let's start on let's start on a few
cool things and we have the MOBA and
cool things and we have the MOBA and
training in the background while we're
training in the background while we're
looking at this but uh yeah let let's
looking at this but uh yeah let let's
start on a few things so I want two
start on a few things so I want two
windows
here we'll do like this
here we'll do like this
today some
gaps cool
okay I'm trying to think how I want to
okay I'm trying to think how I want to
change the
initial bindings
I think what I want to do
I think what I want to do
is snake.
is snake.
pie C snake.
pie C snake.
pie and then
let's see if this what happens here sea
let's see if this what happens here sea
snake has no
Let's do let's do like
this okay so here is uh the snen running
this okay so here is uh the snen running
in rib it's very
nice now we are going to want to make
nice now we are going to want to make
these M's in
C so now we need to figure out C
extensions Pi object
no I hate
this set string I hate all this
stuff I really do not want to have to
stuff I really do not want to have to
put Pi [ __ ] into
put Pi [ __ ] into
C so that's a no
definitely don't want to do
this C types wrapper
this
maybe what do we think about this
maybe what do we think about this
versus I think I should start with what
versus I think I should start with what
I know and then see how simple it
I know and then see how simple it
is so the thing I know how to do at the
is so the thing I know how to do at the
moment is I know how to do this from
moment is I know how to do this from
scyon
right why is my desktop
right why is my desktop
complaining oh it's complaining cuz I'm
complaining oh it's complaining cuz I'm
training a model that's
training a model that's
fine uh let me make sure we don't have
fine uh let me make sure we don't have
the best cooling setup at the moment let
the best cooling setup at the moment let
me just make
me just make
sure we have uh temperatures that are
sure we have uh temperatures that are
not about to shut me off due to
not about to shut me off due to
thermals oh that's not good at
thermals oh that's not good at
all uh hold
on [ __ ] uh what do I do about that
I guess I can't be training models
I guess I can't be training models
locally until I get better
locally until I get better
cooling that's
awkward how long until this one is
done 13 minutes
okay here's what I'm going to
okay here's what I'm going to
do going to kill
do going to kill
that this will go back down to something
that this will go back down to something
insane
again I'm going to make I'm just going
again I'm going to make I'm just going
to run it over the other process on the
to run it over the other process on the
desktop
and I have to commit this don't
I yeah the problem is there's there are
I yeah the problem is there's there are
no case fans at the moment and it's like
no case fans at the moment and it's like
a mini ITX so it has a small cooler
yeah let
me for [ __ ]
sake for
okay these are the right settings
whatever see if this runs
oh
well uh I guess I can't run this policy
well uh I guess I can't run this policy
for a
for a
while that's okay we'll do something
while that's okay we'll do something
else anyways we'll just do something
else anyways we'll just do something
else let's just do the snake stuff uh
else let's just do the snake stuff uh
this will be important anyways and this
this will be important anyways and this
will get potentially change the
will get potentially change the
Moa I'm not dealing with this right now
okay so really what I want here
okay so really what I want here
is like this thing maybe
h
so we're going to
do import
do import
this this is going to take us a little
this this is going to take us a little
bit to figure out how to do
properly so we include snake.
sea
snake and then we'll
do okay so all this stuff here
you have all these various different
you have all these various different
variables and then you
do c snake star
do c snake star
snake
snake
n and then you
do yeah this
do yeah this
right so you basically just write this
right so you basically just write this
giant rapper thing
do you need to store any of these
do you need to store any of these
variables
or can I just do like
this uh Char
this uh Char
grid and I just tab like
grid and I just tab like
this and then
can I just do this
these twitch Bots are really
obnoxious okay so now you have the
obnoxious okay so now you have the
environment
and then we want to do step
right
right
snake yeah I'm messing with some C code
snake yeah I'm messing with some C code
welcome I can look at some of the art
welcome I can look at some of the art
stuff too as as well now if you'd like
stuff too as as well now if you'd like
I'm just looking at some lowl stuff
I'm just looking at some lowl stuff
trying to figure out some like because
trying to figure out some like because
like now we have people talking about
like now we have people talking about
tower defenses we got people talking
tower defenses we got people talking
about you know PVP Sims we've got
about you know PVP Sims we've got
potentially artwork for stuff we've got
potentially artwork for stuff we've got
this I've got other people talking to me
this I've got other people talking to me
about different environments so I'm
about different environments so I'm
trying to figure out some of the lower
trying to figure out some of the lower
level stuff as to like how I'm going to
level stuff as to like how I'm going to
make it easier for everybody to organize
make it easier for everybody to organize
and contribute all these environments
and contribute all these environments
without having like tons and tons and
without having like tons and tons and
tons of repeated buggy
tons of repeated buggy
code busy busy
code busy busy
yeah you
yeah you
know I look at
know I look at
Art I pull Discord
up let me look at this Frame that you
up let me look at this Frame that you
sent
me can I
so this
is like some of these background
elements you have this outlined
okay I was actually thinking about um
okay I was actually thinking about um
I was thinking about the assets
I was thinking about the assets
and it would make sense I think that
and it would make sense I think that
there might be these actually might fit
there might be these actually might fit
the
the
Moa and I could use the puffers as
Moa and I could use the puffers as
minions and then I could use your
minions and then I could use your
Sprites as like the heroes since they're
Sprites as like the heroes since they're
like visually distinct and
like visually distinct and
such
such
um yeah I was thinking about doing
that do you think they're a spot where
that do you think they're a spot where
it would be a good idea for me to import
it would be a good idea for me to import
them and play around with them at the
them and play around with them at the
moment or um yeah what do you think we
moment or um yeah what do you think we
should do with
should do with
that if you want to see what they look
that if you want to see what they look
like in the main game I'd be down to do
like in the main game I'd be down to do
that if not I can just work on the C for
that if not I can just work on the C for
a bit
the background elements are cool as
well plan on giving you full animation
well plan on giving you full animation
sets
sets
awesome I could do it with the Statics
awesome I could do it with the Statics
at the moment cuz it'll like it would be
at the moment cuz it'll like it would be
some work to load in the animation sets
some work to load in the animation sets
in the first place cuz I have to do like
in the first place cuz I have to do like
rib doesn't give you an animation system
rib doesn't give you an animation system
I have to do it manually frame by frame
idle a cast attack death
idle a cast attack death
hurt uh I think that if you want to like
hurt uh I think that if you want to like
just get something to start with the two
just get something to start with the two
most important ones I honestly the most
most important ones I honestly the most
important one is just the move animation
important one is just the move animation
like I guess idle and move
right how do you do your animation sets
right how do you do your animation sets
as well do you just do do uh Sprite
as well do you just do do uh Sprite
sheets or what do you do and also what's
sheets or what do you do and also what's
the source res of these that's uh those
the source res of these that's uh those
are two important things to
know I wouldn't mind doing this real
know I wouldn't mind doing this real
quick since you have cool art for me I
quick since you have cool art for me I
wouldn't mind real quick just taking a
wouldn't mind real quick just taking a
look and seeing if I can import
these scaled 32
32 48 48 canvas for okay
that matches the current resolution for
that matches the current resolution for
sure uh it's going to be tiny on a 4K
sure uh it's going to be tiny on a 4K
you'd have to like exact upscale to
you'd have to like exact upscale to
maintain the pixel like the pixel art
maintain the pixel like the pixel art
style 12 frames are under
perfect I think it's going to it's
perfect I think it's going to it's
substantially less than 12 isn't it like
substantially less than 12 isn't it like
how many are these
they're
they're
nice 2X or 4X when doing yeah that's
nice 2X or 4X when doing yeah that's
fine I know it's like a total pain to do
fine I know it's like a total pain to do
it at higher res and then it's like hard
it at higher res and then it's like hard
to like get pixel art consistent with
to like get pixel art consistent with
higher
higher
res the only thing I was initially
res the only thing I was initially
worried about is like the fact that
worried about is like the fact that
we've got this kind of smooth like
we've got this kind of smooth like
Shader feel for the Moa and I don't know
Shader feel for the Moa and I don't know
how the pixel art uh conflicts maybe
how the pixel art uh conflicts maybe
with that but we'll load these in and
with that but we'll load these in and
let's see
do you have these on a sheet at the
do you have these on a sheet at the
moment that I can uh do you have these
moment that I can uh do you have these
on like a transparent sheet 3232 or what
on like a transparent sheet 3232 or what
should I do load these
should I do load these
in I showed you the sheet that I had
in I showed you the sheet that I had
before
right if you just have these in like any
right if you just have these in like any
reasonable format I can slot them in
reasonable format I can slot them in
real quick
imagine my 300 by 300 plus tarot
imagine my 300 by 300 plus tarot
cards single sheet I mean I'll I'll show
cards single sheet I mean I'll I'll show
you what I was going to do with them um
um oh I guess I have to change the
um oh I guess I have to change the
Sprite sheet don't
Sprite sheet don't
I yeah I have to change the Sprite sheet
I yeah I have to change the Sprite sheet
anyways I'm going to have to like exact
anyways I'm going to have to like exact
upscale them uh photos get rid of
this cuz I think the source sheets for
this cuz I think the source sheets for
the mm Mo
the mm Mo
[Music]
[Music]
or let me double check I'm pretty sure
or let me double check I'm pretty sure
the store sheet is 128 128 and then it
the store sheet is 128 128 and then it
gets
downscaled so these are like the assets
downscaled so these are like the assets
I have at the moment I could just put
I have at the moment I could just put
them in here right
yeah I have it on one
sheet I can show you the way I've done
sheet I can show you the way I've done
animations in the past for stuff but
animations in the past for stuff but
like I think you'll know it's pretty
like I think you'll know it's pretty
standard right like with animations I
standard right like with animations I
just do them in a row so you basically
just do them in a row so you basically
just like increment the position in the
just like increment the position in the
Sprite sheet by whatever the the frame
Sprite sheet by whatever the the frame
size
is man in some way doing like pixel
is man in some way doing like pixel
animation is gets to be harder than
animation is gets to be harder than
doing like 3D animation because you
doing like 3D animation because you
can't like reuse
can't like reuse
stuff as spr should have the option
stuff as spr should have the option
well I mean the render engine that I
well I mean the render engine that I
have is
have is
um
um
custom it's not hard for me to figure
custom it's not hard for me to figure
stuff out
though get you an artist who can do
both heck yeah
this e
just do
this
for
for
e
e e
right for
oh did you send him to me a long time
ago oh you sent me
ago oh you sent me
wow you actually holy hell I didn't
wow you actually holy hell I didn't
realize you did this many key frames
realize you did this many key frames
[ __ ] that must have taken a while thank
you oh what you did something with the
you oh what you did something with the
Stars as
Stars as
well
wait this is
wait this is
Sweet
Holy two major keys
oh I
see I've made animation systems before I
see I've made animation systems before I
gotta I want more of these stupid things
gotta I want more of these stupid things
in C because I don't know what it is
in C because I don't know what it is
with scon it's like the code ends up
with scon it's like the code ends up
just being so un so hard to reuse
just being so un so hard to reuse
compared to see
but I should at some point I will make
but I should at some point I will make
like a render thing that has like a
like a render thing that has like a
little animation system so I I should be
little animation system so I I should be
able to support like variable timing or
able to support like variable timing or
whatever per frame
whatever per frame
maybe but yeah these is great for now
maybe but yeah these is great for now
this format's amazing for
now I mean I had like the assets I had
now I mean I had like the assets I had
to work with before it was like I bought
to work with before it was like I bought
a bunch of these assets and I had to do
a bunch of these assets and I had to do
all this work collating Sprite sheets it
all this work collating Sprite sheets it
was like thousands of like
was like thousands of like
procedural stuff things for the Sprite
procedural stuff things for the Sprite
sheets and then like I got to it and you
sheets and then like I got to it and you
had to like overlay them in specific
had to like overlay them in specific
orders that were not consistent and then
orders that were not consistent and then
like specific frames had different
like specific frames had different
timings in
timings in
milliseconds yeah it was
milliseconds yeah it was
rough this is nice and
rough this is nice and
easy engine Dev crazy is not
easy engine Dev crazy is not
hard it's really not
hard I've been looking for reasons to
hard I've been looking for reasons to
write more
C
frankly global
don't [ __ ] with variable
don't [ __ ] with variable
timing repeat the cell
timing repeat the cell
yeah uh careful with 100 millisecs
yeah uh careful with 100 millisecs
because it's
because it's
currently there are five and I could
currently there are five and I could
change this technically but there
change this technically but there
currently the environment runs at an
currently the environment runs at an
internal rate of five ticks per second
internal rate of five ticks per second
so if you're going to run 60 frames per
so if you're going to run 60 frames per
second that means you
second that means you
have um
have um
well I mean I guess it's the standard
well I mean I guess it's the standard
like whatever 1 over 60
like whatever 1 over 60
right but like 100 millisecond intervals
right but like 100 millisecond intervals
may or may not be available
basically I think if you wanted to do
basically I think if you wanted to do
like the really rough crunchy
like the really rough crunchy
animations and like you wanted to have
animations and like you wanted to have
one frame per game tick then it would be
one frame per game tick then it would be
0.2 like it would be 200 milliseconds
0.2 like it would be 200 milliseconds
but then if you wanted to do like proper
but then if you wanted to do like proper
animation
animation
it would be you know 12 12 key frames
it would be you know 12 12 key frames
and then the Whole Thing is. 2 seconds
and then the Whole Thing is. 2 seconds
but that's going to be really really
but that's going to be really really
slow I mean that's going to be really
slow I mean that's going to be really
really fast for some of these so we'll
really fast for some of these so we'll
have to figure some stuff out but
have to figure some stuff out but
regardless you would use raw c
regardless you would use raw c
yeah I like
C I mean I've been doing syon for a lot
C I mean I've been doing syon for a lot
of this and I've been wanting to Port
of this and I've been wanting to Port
more of it into C so I can use it on the
more of it into C so I can use it on the
web
web
plus it's just it's it's kind of
fun I get a few nice
things I really I haven't written C in
things I really I haven't written C in
like 10 years until this like little
like 10 years until this like little
snake project I did this is C right here
snake project I did this is C right here
um yeah it's nice if you want to play
um yeah it's nice if you want to play
with it it's on the web like this is the
with it it's on the web like this is the
reason I do
it you can just go to puffer
it you can just go to puffer
Ai and there you go go here snake in
Ai and there you go go here snake in
your browser played against RL
your browser played against RL
agents you can just play this yellow
snake renderer
snake Okay this
snake Okay this
works
then
close there we
go so I'm sure that I'll have to fix
go so I'm sure that I'll have to fix
this but
this but
like as far as a binding file goes I
like as far as a binding file goes I
could still use syon for it this would
could still use syon for it this would
be substantially less painful than the
be substantially less painful than the
corresponding p
bind it's still kind of
bind it's still kind of
gross I don't really like it that much
but let me see what the render uh args
but let me see what the render uh args
are withd height
are withd height
colors and tile
size 80 45 16
great I have to fix merge [ __ ]
[ __ ]
I know I have been looking to just write
I know I have been looking to just write
way more C I think I'm going to enjoy
way more C I think I'm going to enjoy
that there well I may or may not there's
that there well I may or may not there's
it's kind of conditional on me being
it's kind of conditional on me being
able to figure out there are a couple
able to figure out there are a couple
small things I haven't figure been able
small things I haven't figure been able
to figure out how to do and see yet like
cleanly pretty much the only thing I
cleanly pretty much the only thing I
haven't been able to figure out how to
haven't been able to figure out how to
do cleanly is manipulating um
do cleanly is manipulating um
multi-dimensional arrays if I can figure
multi-dimensional arrays if I can figure
out how to do that then like yeah C is
out how to do that then like yeah C is
just as easy as anything else and like
just as easy as anything else and like
very
nice where's this thing
oh jeez is
this welcome YouTube
this welcome YouTube
folks we're on late today because I have
folks we're on late today because I have
to work uh on there's a video I'm
to work uh on there's a video I'm
working on for the
working on for the
channel take some time so I put in some
channel take some time so I put in some
hours on that first but we're here we're
hours on that first but we're here we're
doing some cool lowl stuff I am
doing some cool lowl stuff I am
currently very confused with it but uh
currently very confused with it but uh
we'll figure it out and I'm hoping we
we'll figure it out and I'm hoping we
can build something pretty
can build something pretty
cool I'm essentially using the snake
cool I'm essentially using the snake
game that I wrote which is way
simpler as an opportunity to figure out
simpler as an opportunity to figure out
if there are some infrastructure
if there are some infrastructure
improvements I can make to the
MOBA I was literally looking up DLC
MOBA I was literally looking up DLC
Plus+ this morning yeah I that's this is
Plus+ this morning yeah I that's this is
why I hate
why I hate
C++ there's too much
C++ there's too much
[ __ ] I do not use C++ if I can at
[ __ ] I do not use C++ if I can at
all avoid it like
ever hooking it into my
ever hooking it into my
simulation yeah you can make stuff run
simulation yeah you can make stuff run
nice and fast for sure I mean have you
nice and fast for sure I mean have you
seen the C have you seen the uh the
seen the C have you seen the uh the
source code for the snake
source code for the snake
game for uh have you seen the source
game for uh have you seen the source
code for this
this is pretty nice for
this is pretty nice for
Sims also what Sims are you working on
Sims also what Sims are you working on
I'm curious to
know I'll link it to
know I'll link it to
you the main thing with puffer is Sims
Iran so there are multiple different
Iran so there are multiple different
versions of uh the game in here but if
versions of uh the game in here but if
you want the one that is raw
you want the one that is raw
C is not that bad right
C is not that bad right
here there's also a scon version that's
here there's also a scon version that's
almost the same
do you have to do this
from I built the Sim in C and the dlll
from I built the Sim in C and the dlll
in C++
yeah I mean any like compiled language
yeah I mean any like compiled language
without I forget if C has C does have
without I forget if C has C does have
garbage collection right
but uh basically any like compiled
but uh basically any like compiled
language without extra [ __ ] should
language without extra [ __ ] should
be able to be made fast for
Sims C def exter FR okay this is the
Sims C def exter FR okay this is the
Annoying Thing
but this is annoying because it's
but this is annoying because it's
already typed
generalized multi-purpose simulator
generalized multi-purpose simulator
has two s one rolls of
has two s one rolls of
die on every core for X minutes many
die on every core for X minutes many
times it's been a slot machine
okay I's see
okay I's see
interesting
interesting
cool fun to see people working on
cool fun to see people working on
various
Sims presumably this is for work stuff
do I have to add like this extra [ __ ]
do I have to add like this extra [ __ ]
header
header
H we have some simulations at work but
H we have some simulations at work but
this is different the ones at work it
this is different the ones at work it
very are very specific I
see well one of the main things I'm
see well one of the main things I'm
going to be doing with puffer um on the
going to be doing with puffer um on the
business side is making it easier for
business side is making it easier for
companies
companies
to do high perf simulators and
to do high perf simulators and
simulations in a way that they can be
simulations in a way that they can be
used incredibly efficiently with
used incredibly efficiently with
reinforcement learning
that's the main Jam here
I see so this needs to be
I see so this needs to be
compiled
separately
separately no I don't want to compile as
separately no I don't want to compile as
part of the scon module I have to
part of the scon module I have to
compile separately
haven't done it in
Linux same thing right
stuck in windows Game Dev
stuck in windows Game Dev
World some of the windows platform
World some of the windows platform
specific stuff is a
pain oh haven't come
pain oh haven't come
yeah the linking stuff is a pain I'm
yeah the linking stuff is a pain I'm
trying to figure this out I haven't like
trying to figure this out I haven't like
this is not a space I work in very
this is not a space I work in very
frequently um I the reason I'm like
frequently um I the reason I'm like
looking at making uh putting all the
looking at making uh putting all the
Sims into C is because it makes them
Sims into C is because it makes them
easy to run on the web and like the
easy to run on the web and like the
scyon code that I'm writing is
scyon code that I'm writing is
essentially one to one with what the C
essentially one to one with what the C
would be I'm not using any fancy
would be I'm not using any fancy
features other than I like I have one
features other than I like I have one
feature I like that's for um makes it
feature I like that's for um makes it
easy to work with multi-dimensional
easy to work with multi-dimensional
arrays but other than that it's pretty
arrays but other than that it's pretty
much just the same as the C would be so
much just the same as the C would be so
I'm looking at this a porting option
I'm looking at this a porting option
like I did I did a trial right with the
like I did I did a trial right with the
snake Sim and this works really well so
snake Sim and this works really well so
I'm looking at porting more complex
I'm looking at porting more complex
stuff potentially
well hold on I can actually make it
well hold on I can actually make it
compiled as part of this ithon for now
compiled as part of this ithon for now
at
at
least that removes the problem of having
least that removes the problem of having
to
to
do dll
let's just for now
hello
welcome do I have to include the whole
welcome do I have to include the whole
signature here
really I hope I don't actually have to
really I hope I don't actually have to
do this this because this is gross this
do this this because this is gross this
is like a gross amount of just header
is like a gross amount of just header
stuff
[Music]

renderer
okay put this down
here cannot what is what is wrong with
here cannot what is what is wrong with
all this stuff let's
all this stuff let's
see
so call with wrong number of arguments
so call with wrong number of arguments
I'm assuming this is just
the what is
the what is
this did it hallucinate this or is this

lazy CU I just
lazy CU I just
like can't be bothered remembering
things and then your artwork is
so 11 is support which one is supposed
so 11 is support which one is supposed
to be
Wich good do devs are
spoiled honestly I'm not tempted by any
spoiled honestly I'm not tempted by any
like I'm not really tempted by any of
like I'm not really tempted by any of
the engines
really like rib I'm way happier just
really like rib I'm way happier just
like building [ __ ] in SE and shipping
it or I guess most of my stuff's in scon

be able to do the front end I really
be able to do the front end I really

I believe and then Y

I think I missed one hold

bad my bad let me fix

if you give me an art

you add to discords like the just the

mod man
holy [ __ ] look at

Knights uh
okay here we
okay here we
go this is with your art in
it this will yeah there you go though
that's
that's
sweet it's not going to look as good in
sweet it's not going to look as good in
as um you know it needs the animations I
as um you know it needs the animations I
think more so because like the puffers
think more so because like the puffers
you can kind of get away with not having
you can kind of get away with not having
them animated because they're kind of
them animated because they're kind of
just
Dopey like they're fish it would be
Dopey like they're fish it would be
better if even those
swam moving oh well the shrimp it has a
swam moving oh well the shrimp it has a
a move speed buff
a move speed buff
right so you can do
this and it also has like jump attack so
this and it also has like jump attack so
it can like do this you see like the
it can like do this you see like the
dash
AOE of course you're not very strong at
AOE of course you're not very strong at
the
start these fit way more than I thought
start these fit way more than I thought
that they would though I'll I'll give
that they would though I'll I'll give
you that like these fit way more than I
you that like these fit way more than I
thought that they would
thought that they would
they're kind of small on the
screen I I guess I'm on a 1440p monitor
screen I I guess I'm on a 1440p monitor
with no scaling up on this
but that's pretty
but that's pretty
sweet that's pretty
sweet are they there are these agents
sweet are they there are these agents
using neuronet models yeah of course
using neuronet models yeah of course
they all are hold on let me use a rest
they all are hold on let me use a rest
from real quick I'll be right back and
from real quick I'll be right back and
we'll keep uh we got another hour and a
we'll keep uh we got another hour and a
half of Devon Me Maybe maybe two we'll
see
e
e e
going to need that animation player
going to need that animation player
right
now you have an animation player that
now you have an animation player that
you can use yourself for Dev
you can use yourself for Dev
right I just need to tell you that the
right I just need to tell you that the
timings so let me give you this at the
timings so let me give you this at the
time being so right now um the way that
time being so right now um the way that
I have right now the one issue is that
like the frame ints are a little bit
like the frame ints are a little bit
weird because technically the way I'm
weird because technically the way I'm
doing it right now the animations are a
doing it right now the animations are a
maximum of. 2 seconds which is like way
maximum of. 2 seconds which is like way
too uh way way way too fast
too uh way way way too fast
um I'm going to be able to fix
um I'm going to be able to fix
that but I'm going to have to think
that but I'm going to have to think
about the animation system a little bit
about the animation system a little bit
and the reason for that is that the game
and the reason for that is that the game
ticks themselves are. 2 seconds so there
ticks themselves are. 2 seconds so there
are 12 frames in
are 12 frames in
between uh each game tick so like
between uh each game tick so like
technically yeah you can just slot the
technically yeah you can just slot the
12 animation like the set the animations
12 animation like the set the animations
and they're just going to be really
and they're just going to be really
really fast until I figure out how to
really fast until I figure out how to
slow stuff down right and spread the
slow stuff down right and spread the
animations
out and I'll make some cool animation
out and I'll make some cool animation
system
cool we've integrated these these are
awesome e
cool there you go your stuff is now
cool there you go your stuff is now
added to the MOBA
officially once we actually like put the
officially once we actually like put the
anms in properly and do some stuff you
anms in properly and do some stuff you
can feel free to DM me um however you
can feel free to DM me um however you
would like to be listed on the uh
would like to be listed on the uh
contributors page though I do those in
contributors page though I do those in
batches it's a little bit annoying to
batches it's a little bit annoying to

really knit SE snake
okay these do return

that's currently driving me crazy that I
that's currently driving me crazy that I
can do in scon but not in C like when I

you can't do this in

scyon comp
time cross
compile yeah well that's true for C
wait if that's true B you can literally
wait if that's true B you can literally
use the zig build tool on C code
so honestly the r like the rust

rolling releases the hell you wanted to

that do you have to do a

cannot incomplete type sea snake is so
cannot incomplete type sea snake is so
weird
weird
one language to rule them
all I don't know C and python stack is
all I don't know C and python stack is
very
very
nice syon is really good if I could just
nice syon is really good if I could just
compile scon to web assembly like I'd
compile scon to web assembly like I'd
probably be set
but JavaScript uh please no
but JavaScript uh please no
please not
JavaScript you see that I'm writing C so
JavaScript you see that I'm writing C so
it can be on web this is because I
it can be on web this is because I
prefer to write C that to uh
JavaScript it would literally rather
JavaScript it would literally rather
write C than JavaScript
what do you use to compile the web
what do you use to compile the web
assembly M
scripton apparently there's now uh there
scripton apparently there's now uh there
might be native support
now WM
now WM
no uh m scripton
I'm also sick of the scon build times
there the other motive for this
e probably I could figure out a way to
e probably I could figure out a way to
speed them
speed them
up yeah they're a bit slow because you
up yeah they're a bit slow because you
have to transpile like it makes a 30,000
have to transpile like it makes a 30,000
line C file and then compiles that which
line C file and then compiles that which
is really obnoxious
I'm just going to paste errors into this
I'm just going to paste errors into this
because this is literally just me not
because this is literally just me not
knowing
docks oops
oh I'm just
oh I'm just
dumb this is like python rot
brain there we
brain there we
go uh maybe not wait
RB oh it needs theh
file need the H
file need the H
file does it not have the H file
just doesn't have the do h
this is the one other obnoxious thing
this is the one other obnoxious thing
with
with
the
the
path you have to
export what's this stupid I'm still not
export what's this stupid I'm still not
used to end
used to end
variables give me export
variables give me export
command for
if this thing decides not to respond I
if this thing decides not to respond I
deserve it for because I should really
deserve it for because I should really
just do this
this is where it is right rb.
yeah I see
it did I do that wrong
my lab
really
I'll fix that in a second I'll be right
I'll fix that in a second I'll be right
back restro real
back restro real
quick
see
e
e e
all
all
right hello
folks so what we're doing briefly is we
folks so what we're doing briefly is we
are we have a scyon version of a snake
are we have a scyon version of a snake
environment originally written in Python
environment originally written in Python
and then I also orted it to
and then I also orted it to
C um so now what I'm trying to do is I'm
C um so now what I'm trying to do is I'm
trying to see if I can get uh an easy
trying to see if I can get uh an easy
way to make bindings for this
way to make bindings for this
environment to python
environment to python
uh not just for the snake environment
uh not just for the snake environment
the point here is currently that there's
the point here is currently that there's
a bunch of Jank that occurs for API
a bunch of Jank that occurs for API
compatibility for integration between
compatibility for integration between
Python and lower level stuff and I'm
Python and lower level stuff and I'm
using this s en as an
using this s en as an
opportunity to see if I can make stuff
opportunity to see if I can make stuff
simpler and easier to work with and if I
simpler and easier to work with and if I
can that's going to enable us to do some
can that's going to enable us to do some
lower level stuff with the mooba lower
lower level stuff with the mooba lower
level stuff with other M's and to to not
level stuff with other M's and to to not
have such a bad time of all of it so
have such a bad time of all of it so
that's what we're looking at at the
that's what we're looking at at the
moment and yeah let's keep figuring this
moment and yeah let's keep figuring this
out of course this does involve uh a
out of course this does involve uh a
number of just silly errors like me not
number of just silly errors like me not
being able to compile stuff what OS is
being able to compile stuff what OS is
this this is technically windows but not
this this is technically windows but not
really because this is all running in
really because this is all running in
WSL which is a bunto but it's inside of
WSL which is a bunto but it's inside of
a Docker container which is also a bunto
a Docker container which is also a bunto
the docker container is puffer tank and
the docker container is puffer tank and
you can kind of just put that on
you can kind of just put that on
whatever machine and always have this
whatever machine and always have this
exact exact same Dev
environment that's what this
is so technically this is puffer
tank ra. H why is this
not am I including this from the long
not am I including this from the long
the wrong spot
oh yeah I am including it from the wrong
oh yeah I am including it from the wrong
spot l
still
no okay now I'm
no okay now I'm
confused the path right environments
confused the path right environments

amd64 um
is there just more stuff that I have to
is there just more stuff that I have to
pass that I'm not
realizing probably
right uh I could
thing is if I compile it as a standalone
thing is if I compile it as a standalone
it gets
annoying it gets really annoying if I
annoying it gets really annoying if I
try to compile it as a
standalone CU then I can't trigger
standalone CU then I can't trigger
rebuild
oh did I mess up my library
path I think I just messed up the
path I think I just messed up the
library path let me just open a
library path let me just open a
new
terminal so there you asked about what
terminal so there you asked about what
I'm using there you go so from WSL
I'm using there you go so from WSL
starts the tank and then I have my nice
starts the tank and then I have my nice
uh my nice container with all my stuff
uh my nice container with all my stuff
in
it okay
okay there we go
how does it
work
ah that is
ah that is
different appears to
work did the snake environment compile
incompatible pointer
type well we'll see what's uh whether
type well we'll see what's uh whether
this messes up or
not under Define symbol and
drawing undefined symbol and
drawing this is just like the last one
drawing this is just like the last one
in the file right
sh jeez how many freaking twitch Bots
sh jeez how many freaking twitch Bots
are there that's
are there that's
ridiculous it's like two a
day Linker couldn't
find oh okay so you can do
maybe
maybe
this maybe I have to modify the setup
do
extension forces equal
I that get
include
RB Five Point
okay
I like how it thinks C++ for some dumb
reason right set up
tools
tools
okay so does this do it
uh there is nice size
uh there is nice size
snake environements
snake environements
ocean
snake I don't know why I did it with
snake I don't know why I did it with
dots that was that's
bizarre okay
and then we run the
demo still undefined
symbol but hold on we're probably doing
symbol but hold on we're probably doing
something screwy from here
right from SI snake import snake
and then undefined symbol end
drawing why
let's recompile let me make sure it's
let's recompile let me make sure it's
actually
compiling appears to be
do we get compile error
somewhere
struct assignment to se snake from
struct assignment to se snake from
incompatible pointers type sne snake
incompatible pointers type sne snake
star
I'm pie
if a stru does not type deft
thought it was type
thought it was type
Deft it is type deft
let me see
R SE
R SE
snake struct
renderer is it like SE struck or
renderer is it like SE struck or
something weird
ah but if they were not correctly
linked reset takes
linked reset takes
see snake
star this is exactly what it was
before no discernable
differences incompatible pointer
type so this is like not getting defined
type so this is like not getting defined
correctly
correctly

somehow what wait this is like is there
somehow what wait this is like is there
supposed to be a valid error message
supposed to be a valid error message
here because it's like The Arrow is not

lining up
invalid assignment from incompatible
invalid assignment from incompatible

supposed to be
oh jeez I can't tell where this is
oh jeez I can't tell where this is

be

Star rewards view is a float
star then do I call all these with
star then do I call all these with
[Music]
[Music]
with the right views yes I
do man this is so weird I
can't assignment to type struct
wait this is totally the type def thing
wait this is totally the type def thing
isn't
it is this valid is this like valid can
it is this valid is this like valid can
you do this
okay well apparently
let me take this one out for now I think
let me take this one out for now I think
that this will be good but not
yet okay so this was the one that was
yet okay so this was the one that was
buggy and now type dstruct
buggy and now type dstruct
syntax error
do I need to do
like okay hold
like okay hold
on we're going to find
this assignment two
was right up here
was right up here
somewhere assignment to struct se snake
somewhere assignment to struct se snake
star from incompatible pointer SE snake

star
okay so this thinks that this is a
okay so this thinks that this is a
struct instead of a type dat struct is
struct instead of a type dat struct is
it like a c struct or
something is this actually for freaking
something is this actually for freaking
it are you got to be kidding me does
it are you got to be kidding me does
this now
work that's so [ __ ]
work that's so [ __ ]
obnoxious apparently there is a keyword
obnoxious apparently there is a keyword
which is C type
death that you need if you're going to
death that you need if you're going to
bind to a type def struct instead of a
bind to a type def struct instead of a
normal struct I
normal struct I
guess g
okay so we still have this undefined
okay so we still have this undefined
symbol but this now
symbol but this now
compiles this now compiles cleanly at
least isn't learning
least isn't learning
fun yeah I'm having so much fun
stupid undefined symbol and drawing okay
stupid undefined symbol and drawing okay
so this is like a link [ __ ]
thing right so this is why I was trying
thing right so this is why I was trying
to define the extension
is it like Dash L rib do I need to pass
is it like Dash L rib do I need to pass
this
um do I need to pass all the rib
Flags there a lot of them
right e
about
this do I
this do I
see uh I don't see the flags being added
see uh I don't see the flags being added
here
I don't see the
flags I don't see elrb I don't see any
flags I don't see elrb I don't see any
of the flags I just
of the flags I just
specified so I'm guessing this is not
specified so I'm guessing this is not
going to work because the flags weren't
going to work because the flags weren't
used
yeah why don't these get used
I guess this is where I start trying to
build this extension so I can explicitly
build this extension so I can explicitly
link uh all the stuff that I need for
link uh all the stuff that I need for
this
dash
dash well hold on weird to have these
dash well hold on weird to have these
these two syntax
next
this oh there's the elrb
this oh there's the elrb
it got added
now still
no look right here we got all of our
flags building SI snake extension
remove
this okay so now it can set it up
this okay so now it can set it up
again
again
[Music]
copying right
copying right
there I think this is the one it
there I think this is the one it
wants let me try something
ah this one
ah this one
works this one I believe
works
so it's just compiling to the wrong spot
so it's just compiling to the wrong spot
let me look that
up but we figured it
up but we figured it
out and actually if I can do this then
out and actually if I can do this then
this will be really nice to
have 713 I got to hurry this up though
have 713 I got to hurry this up though
because I'm getting hungry
for for
it's obnoxious
okay
okay now we can
open uh SE snake
open uh SE snake
pi and we can see what's wrong with this
so this is what we're calling it
with this is what we're calling it with
with this is what we're calling it with
and then this is the signature it's
and then this is the signature it's
expecting grid snakes observation

Death um that is weird because this
Death um that is weird because this
looks correct to
looks correct to
me let's see
why snake in nit takes from
one to 13 positional arguments is that
correct one two three four five six
correct one two three four five six
seven8
seven8
10 16 no it definitely takes
um definitely take 17
and wait
and wait
snake in a reset
yeah this is definitely correct and then
yeah this is definitely correct and then
it comes from s snake
here oh maybe
I might have uh I might
I might have uh I might
have gotten something wrong
here let's try
build building the extension
and where did it build
to not
there it show me
these are
these are
copies this one
built SI
snake. o
oh wait build
temp
wait build lib
okay so it's just not respecting the
okay so it's just not respecting the
output directory right
so that time it flashed the uh the
so that time it flashed the uh the
renderer up on the screen like a blank
canvas something's very weird with these
canvas something's very weird with these
extensions
I'm trying to think how I want to do
I'm trying to think how I want to do
this
it's not respecting the
oh it just I don't know where it did
oh it just I don't know where it did
with
my wait runtime Library
dur it's just not it's this ARG is not
dur it's just not it's this ARG is not
good I guess it's not doing anything
good I guess it's not doing anything
with this
this build file is so [ __ ]
this is the right way isn't
this is the right way isn't
it yeah this is the right
way but wait if I do it this way
h
oh that's stupid
oh that's stupid
I'll try specifying the package
location but I don't I don't understand
location but I don't I don't understand
this thing I don't understand why the
this thing I don't understand why the
hell it's like
this it should find the package
here why is it like
here why is it like
this like seriously why does scyon eyes
this like seriously why does scyon eyes
behave different
behave different
when
you when you specify it one way versus
you when you specify it one way versus
the
other let me comment this as well
man like why is it like
this I'm getting really hungry I'm going
this I'm getting really hungry I'm going
to order food I'm going to keep working
to order food I'm going to keep working
on this though until food gets here
I really hate
Packaging
e e
okay it's
okay it's
there let me figure this out me to
there let me figure this out me to
Christmas is the
Christmas is the
worst
worst
um I'm just the thing like I'm not sure
is having to compile this through scon
is having to compile this through scon
and the like through pip in the first
and the like through pip in the first
place is
place is
dumb
um we should just be able to build this
um we should just be able to build this
and freaking import it
no not
this e
you must declare them yourself isn't
you must declare them yourself isn't
that just
stupid like why do you need to redefine
stupid like why do you need to redefine
something that already has a static
something that already has a static
definition
I mean regardless
though do I need to link is this what I
though do I need to link is this what I
need to do do I need to compile it
separately then I'm still going to have
separately then I'm still going to have
the problem with this stupid extension

thing I hate this like setup tools

just getting stuck on like compiling

stuff correctly here and it's such a

pain in the ass
I'm also starving so food should be here
I'm also starving so food should be here
soon
but like what the
heck maybe I can do this as the C
heck maybe I can do this as the C
extension
and
then e
I'm just so conf confused as to how this
I'm just so conf confused as to how this
is supposed to

does this actually work here if this

works this would be
amazing I don't think it will
cuz I hate this extension thing
cuz I hate this extension thing
here it's just really obnoxious it like
here it's just really obnoxious it like
doesn't work ever
then we just take this extension
then we just take this extension
here put this up here just in case we
here put this up here just in case we
need
it we uncomment the SI snake

is that a falling sandim yeah kind of
I'm not seeing the uh the linked Library
I'm not seeing the uh the linked Library
here so I think it's not linking my
here so I think it's not linking my
library
correctly yeah it's a fair bit more
so
so
interestingly we still get the undefined
interestingly we still get the undefined
symbol
issue this seg faults well you can't do
issue this seg faults well you can't do
that with a shared library right I'm
that with a shared library right I'm
going to have to like take some time to
going to have to like take some time to
really understand the build system here

unfortunately um I guess in the meantime

we can take a quick look
we can take a quick look
at our train

runs which we'll pick back

up uh next

Invaders oh it's actually it's starting
to take off a little bit you can

see I think we'll get some uh some
see I think we'll get some uh some
better runs than this we still have
better runs than this we still have
another 200 experiments to go uh the
another 200 experiments to go uh the
slope is not the best here you'd think
slope is not the best here you'd think
it would find some better stuff but you
it would find some better stuff but you
never know and
never know and
then here we are at 2168 ELO
then here we are at 2168 ELO
so looks like it found a slightly better
so looks like it found a slightly better
one than before this is a nicer shape to
