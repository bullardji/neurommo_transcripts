Let's see if Finn and Sam are around.
Okay. So, I've put that in the Discord.

see puffer

puffer drone.
Okay, so this is random policy on drone

Then we also have

Is it not drone swarm?
Ah, okay.
Grab his puff for 11.
We're going to work on some cool tech.

It's going to be domain randomization

We have two different sims.
I'm going to see if we can get like a

I'm trying to think where I want to

start with this because there are two

It makes sense to have like a domain

randomized drone.
It probably does, right?
All right, let's try that. So, basically
All right, let's try that. So, basically
what I'm trying to think here is if I
what I'm trying to think here is if I
can just make like a drone.h that'll
can just make like a drone.h that'll
work for both of these

I think we will do that. We'll start

We're going to get this to work with

There are other randomizations I think

and my internet did not go down. So,
and my internet did not go down. So,
it's like it's reream being weird.
Stupid thing.
Okay, we don't need this.
Keep drone.
We'll get rid of everything that depends

on the end

So we'll just keep basically this 180

which is mostly just the map and stuff.
And then we should be able to cut out.
Like most of this stuff, I would think.
Which directory is it going to live in?
Which directory is it going to live in?
I don't know, Sam. For now, we'll just
I don't know, Sam. For now, we'll just

And we'll figure that out later if we

For now, I just kind of want to get the

math to be reusable because like you're

going to see what I have to do is I'm

going to have to add randomizations into

a lot of the math and uh I don't want to

have to do that multiple times.
So maybe something like this, right?
What turns you in OBS, man?
Are we back?
