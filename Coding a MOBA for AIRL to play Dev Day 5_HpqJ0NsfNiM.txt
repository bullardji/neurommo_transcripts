Kind: captions
Language: en
okay we are
live I'm do a couple quick
live I'm do a couple quick
things while this uh updates and stream
things while this uh updates and stream
starts up
starts up
here so first
here so first
thing is we're going to take a look
at how well this does from yesterday
and
and
oops what's this A th000 ticks or
oops what's this A th000 ticks or
something 20 FPS 50
something 20 FPS 50
seconds do
like something like
this let's 20 FPS
right
right
yep and let's uh let's just put together
yep and let's uh let's just put together
a little demo for
a little demo for
Twitter before we
Twitter before we
start and then there'll be lots of cool
start and then there'll be lots of cool
stuff to
do oops uh we have to
recompile for
let's see how this demo
looks got what I called it
today we're going to be doing uh neutral
today we're going to be doing uh neutral
camps the map is going to look way more
camps the map is going to look way more
like a full DOTA map by the time we're
like a full DOTA map by the time we're
done with this as
done with this as
well and we're going to do a few other
well and we're going to do a few other
things along the way I'm
things along the way I'm
sure but this is going to be a fun day
sure but this is going to be a fun day
and then tomorrow I'm going to try to
and then tomorrow I'm going to try to
like get all this stuff into shape where
like get all this stuff into shape where
we can merge it back up into Dev so
we can merge it back up into Dev so
it'll be easier for people to play with
it'll be easier for people to play with
I put this uh
I put this uh
here okay so this is the gift we just
saved that was a nice little demo let's
saved that was a nice little demo let's
put this on Twitter
and then we'll get started on the
code day five
cool Julian's funny
okay so let's get started on some Dev
okay so let's get started on some Dev
here
um I really like the assassin character
um I really like the assassin character
they all feel okay they all feel decent
they all feel okay they all feel decent
enough
enough
but we're going to have to start on the
but we're going to have to start on the
the neutrals for
the neutrals for
sure morning
Quinn we're doing neutrals
Quinn we're doing neutrals
today I'm on a little bit early because
today I'm on a little bit early because
I've missed half of my
I've missed half of my
breakfast they swapped my order for
locks which many people would take as a
locks which many people would take as a
happy upgrade but I despise
happy upgrade but I despise
locks so instead I'm here having my
locks so instead I'm here having my
coffee being
coffee being
hungry
hungry
um let's see what we're going to start
um let's see what we're going to start
with here
with here
so I think that the neutrals actually
so I think that the neutrals actually
need a different set of
need a different set of
IDs right compared to
IDs right compared to
creeps
because yeah the neutrals need a
because yeah the neutrals need a
different set of IDs compared to
different set of IDs compared to
creeps damn as a Jew I love locks are
creeps damn as a Jew I love locks are
fire oh
fire oh
dude I've been going there's uh like a
dude I've been going there's uh like a
Jewish um
Jewish um
Bakery uh I've been going there for
Bakery uh I've been going there for
breakfast every day love the pastries
breakfast every day love the pastries
they've got great Hala they've got nice
they've got great Hala they've got nice
coffee I wish they had like a good some
coffee I wish they had like a good some
soups or stuff but like it's awesome I
soups or stuff but like it's awesome I
just can't do
just can't do
Locks Jewish Bakery and Jewish deli are
Locks Jewish Bakery and Jewish deli are
like my two favorite damn things that I
like my two favorite damn things that I
wish we had more of
wish we had more of
H can't do Locks though no fish for me
but yeah I actually like what I wouldn't
but yeah I actually like what I wouldn't
do to have a Jewish deli like right
do to have a Jewish deli like right
around here oh
man there was a place when I was growing
man there was a place when I was growing
up that would always have like just the
up that would always have like just the
best damn chicken noodle soup the best
best damn chicken noodle soup the best
like pastrami sandwiches you know you
like pastrami sandwiches you know you
always get like a big bowl of pickles
always get like a big bowl of pickles
with your food it was it was awesome
with your food it was it was awesome
wish we had one of those around
here I think we need to have numb
here I think we need to have numb
neutrals
neutrals
here so I'm going to just add
here so I'm going to just add
it actually it's Towers in Num creeps
it actually it's Towers in Num creeps
num neutrals
I'm neutral like this is
fine oh no they all start they all end
fine oh no they all start they all end
with us so we'll keep it
consistent oh I did do agents creeps
consistent oh I did do agents creeps
Towers like
Towers like
that
okay I don't like
okay I don't like
that agents tow creeps
neutrals agents creeps neutrals Tower
yeah agent creeps
neutrals okay so we'll start here with
neutrals okay so we'll start here with
uh num neutrals
num
num
neutrals 100 is fine
neutrals 100 is fine
I don't even think we need 100 right but
I don't even think we need 100 right but
we'll see what idas we end up
using we'll add what's
using we'll add what's
this num
this num
creeps neutrals
Towers row syntax but
Towers row syntax but
[Music]
whatever I think I can just you can
whatever I think I can just you can
split like this
split like this
right
right
yeah that's
yeah that's
fine so we've got our
entities now we
entities now we
need we need to add neutrals into
here
here
creeps neutrals Towers
Co
all right now we get to start thinking
all right now we get to start thinking
about how we're going to spawn the
about how we're going to spawn the
neutrals
in they're going to be a little
in they're going to be a little
different than the uh the creep waves I
different than the uh the creep waves I
think
cuz like the individual camps have a
cuz like the individual camps have a
respawn
respawn
timer right
we could just give the
we could just give the
enemies well wait there are a few ways
enemies well wait there are a few ways
we can do it
right we can make all the camps just
right we can make all the camps just
respawn at a fixed
respawn at a fixed
interval that would probably be the
interval that would probably be the
simplest
so that I mean that's kind of reasonable
so that I mean that's kind of reasonable
right it's like hey you got to go do
right it's like hey you got to go do
your clear and let's say they respawn
your clear and let's say they respawn
every few minutes so like once you
every few minutes so like once you
finish your clear is when you have a
finish your clear is when you have a
window to go do other stuff in Rome
right of course in Dota it's more common
right of course in Dota it's more common
for uh compared to league right in Dota
for uh compared to league right in Dota
it's way more common for the laners cuz
it's way more common for the laners cuz
there's not like a dedicated jungle so
there's not like a dedicated jungle so
it's way more common for the laners to
it's way more common for the laners to
want to take
camps does that change
anything I think we can just start with
anything I think we can just start with
the global
the global
respawns global respawn timer
let's start
let's start
with in
with in
reset no we don't have to spawn them in
reset no we don't have to spawn them in
reset we spawn them
reset we spawn them
in uh in here I
in uh in here I
believe but we're going to need their
believe but we're going to need their
positions we're going to need their
positions we're going to need their
positions which is a little
positions which is a little
harder and they also need to have uh
harder and they also need to have uh
some sort of ID to them don't
some sort of ID to them don't
they well we'll write the uh the initial
they well we'll write the uh the initial
code and then we'll we'll have to add
code and then we'll we'll have to add
stuff and I'm sure we'll have to change
stuff and I'm sure we'll have to change
the map quite very uh early on here
so we also have to write AI for these
so we also have to write AI for these
things it's actually a little bit more
things it's actually a little bit more
work than I
work than I
thought okay so 1,00
thought okay so 1,00
ticks uh this is to Common we're going
ticks uh this is to Common we're going
to make this 3600
to make this 3600
ticks self Dot
and it's going to be
like how do we do the do it for spawn
like how do we do the do it for spawn
creep
wave Lane creep spawn
yeah so there's like a spawn function of
yeah so there's like a spawn function of
sorts
here and I don't think we need this like
here and I don't think we need this like
this Lane logic we just
need
need
spawn
neutral idx
right and we don't need a neutral idx
right and we don't need a neutral idx
it's literally just
idx okay and then we
do we do
do we do
uh this exact same sort of logic here
uh this exact same sort of logic here
it's going to be neutral is get neutral
it's going to be neutral is get neutral
we have to add a neutral
we have to add a neutral
up
up
here
here
neutral we're going to
neutral we're going to
say get
say get
neutral if so if it's dead we
neutral if so if it's dead we
continue otherwise we update the
continue otherwise we update the
status and we do neutral AI so very very
status and we do neutral AI so very very
similar but not quite the
same so now we need to add the spawn and
same so now we need to add the spawn and
the AI function
functions
um these are actually
um these are actually
both pretty
easy cuz we can reuse the Waypoint
easy cuz we can reuse the Waypoint
system with one Waypoint let's go back
system with one Waypoint let's go back
again with the mooba how's it going it's
again with the mooba how's it going it's
going very well thank you morning
going very well thank you morning
uh we're going to do neutrals today
uh we're going to do neutrals today
we're going to add neutrals we're going
we're going to add neutrals we're going
to expand the map to look way more like
to expand the map to look way more like
a a full scale MOBA uh we're probably
a a full scale MOBA uh we're probably
going to hopefully do a lot of
going to hopefully do a lot of
miscellaneous stuff as well we're going
miscellaneous stuff as well we're going
to add like leveling we're probably
to add like leveling we're probably
going to fix up like attack ranges and
going to fix up like attack ranges and
stuff like that and we're going to see
stuff like that and we're going to see
where it goes from
where it goes from
there I'm hoping this is going to
there I'm hoping this is going to
actually start to look like a a more
actually start to look like a a more
full scale MOBA today I mean of course
full scale MOBA today I mean of course
the thing that's really going to make it
the thing that's really going to make it
pop is as soon as I just get some art
pop is as soon as I just get some art
for the map
for the map
and like maybe some animations for the
and like maybe some animations for the
characters then it'll actually look like
characters then it'll actually look like
a game but we're actually doing very
a game but we're actually doing very
well on the mechanical side like it's
well on the mechanical side like it's
kind of we have a lot of the pieces in
kind of we have a lot of the pieces in
place already just in the four short
place already just in the four short
days so I'll be around here do it all
days so I'll be around here do it all
day it'll be
fun so we've got creep AI
fun so we've got creep AI
we need to add neutral
we need to add neutral
AI going to
do with RL in general is it better to
do with RL in general is it better to
practice build the agent with the
practice build the agent with the
ability to work out the
ability to work out the
features rather than setting X
features rather than setting X
features
features
um oh I see what you're
um oh I see what you're
saying kind
saying kind
of I personally don't do a bunch I don't
of I personally don't do a bunch I don't
do feature engineering type work but
do feature engineering type work but
what I do is uh I rep when I'm building
what I do is uh I rep when I'm building
the game I'm keeping in mind a pretty
the game I'm keeping in mind a pretty
reasonable way of representing local
reasonable way of representing local
state such that I'm not producing a
state such that I'm not producing a
bunch of garbage data right so like
bunch of garbage data right so like
these agents are going to get a low
these agents are going to get a low
reses 2D map of uh essentially different
reses 2D map of uh essentially different
IDs for different agent
IDs for different agent
types that's going to be relatively easy
types that's going to be relatively easy
for them to interpret the one thing that
for them to interpret the one thing that
will be relatively hard and may re ire
will be relatively hard and may re ire
some feature engineering is uh the
some feature engineering is uh the
positions like you might have to make
positions like you might have to make
instead of giving absolute positions you
instead of giving absolute positions you
might have to do it relative to the
might have to do it relative to the
current agent that's the only bit of
current agent that's the only bit of
feature engineering I might have to
feature engineering I might have to
consider with this feature engineering
consider with this feature engineering
is very effective um for solving real
is very effective um for solving real
problems but uh it's also something that
problems but uh it's also something that
you can sink a lot of time into and
you can sink a lot of time into and
doesn't really Advance any of the
doesn't really Advance any of the
fundamentals
fundamentals
so I prefer working on more General and
so I prefer working on more General and
easily transferable stuff like high
easily transferable stuff like high
performance engineering techniques high
performance engineering techniques high
quality hyper parameter sweeps right
quality hyper parameter sweeps right
stuff like
that okay so neutral
AI we do not
AI we do not
need way
need way
points or
points or
Lanes or NE or even necessarily
Lanes or NE or even necessarily
destinations
makes sense yeah I appreciate it yeah
uh rl's going to be so much better and
uh rl's going to be so much better and
in just a couple months it's going to be
in just a couple months it's going to be
crazy like it's going to get so so much
crazy like it's going to get so so much
better so soon like folks don't even
better so soon like folks don't even
know I mean between all these M I've
know I mean between all these M I've
been developing and how fast they are
been developing and how fast they are
and the hyper pram sweeps and stuff
and the hyper pram sweeps and stuff
we're just going to have like a nice set
we're just going to have like a nice set
of benchmarks that train it a million
of benchmarks that train it a million
steps per second
steps per second
and I mean when you have just when you
and I mean when you have just when you
have stuff that runs a hundred times at
have stuff that runs a hundred times at
least faster than a few months ago that
least faster than a few months ago that
just lets you do so much cool stuff I
just lets you do so much cool stuff I
can't
wait of course I don't get to wait I
wait of course I don't get to wait I
have to build it
right I've also got a colleague that's
right I've also got a colleague that's
working on another environment that I'm
working on another environment that I'm
hoping will be ready relatively soon I
hoping will be ready relatively soon I
got to go help help him out with it
got to go help help him out with it
probably but uh yeah I want there to be
probably but uh yeah I want there to be
a lot of these cool environments around
a lot of these cool environments around
problem is they take at least a week a
problem is they take at least a week a
piece to
build okay
so what's creep Target can I reuse creep
so what's creep Target can I reuse creep
Target I can totally reuse creep Target
Target I can totally reuse creep Target
right
yeah so Target pit is reuse creep
Target if Target pit is negative
Target if Target pit is negative
then are you adding a guy for the
then are you adding a guy for the
training or not rendering for now no the
training or not rendering for now no the
the guey is this is a key this is a very
the guey is this is a key this is a very
very important thing in reinforcement
very important thing in reinforcement
learning uh the guey is not for train
learning uh the guey is not for train
time the guey is for people to play the
time the guey is for people to play the
game and to understand what's going on
game and to understand what's going on
um agent should have access to the exact
um agent should have access to the exact
same information that humans see on
same information that humans see on
screen sometimes a smaller crop of it
screen sometimes a smaller crop of it
for performance reasons but the agent
for performance reasons but the agent
should have access to the exact same
should have access to the exact same
information but you do not want to
information but you do not want to
render during training it immediately
render during training it immediately
costs you 99 plus% of your
costs you 99 plus% of your
performance never worth
that only exception to this is if you
that only exception to this is if you
want to think of
want to think of
like in something like the snake
like in something like the snake
environment that I made for instance the
environment that I made for instance the
observations are very very close to what
observations are very very close to what
is rendered um it's just like instead of
is rendered um it's just like instead of
actually rendering the pixels I have an
actually rendering the pixels I have an
index for each color but it's almost
index for each color but it's almost
identical to the observation but that's
identical to the observation but that's
only because in that case like the
only because in that case like the
render ing is basically the exact same
render ing is basically the exact same
thing as the state
anyways but yeah if I were to put it
anyways but yeah if I were to put it
through any sort of gooey Library you
through any sort of gooey Library you
lose all your
lose all your
performance I've seen projects where
performance I've seen projects where
like people will write environments that
like people will write environments that
should run a million steps per second
should run a million steps per second
and they'll run like 200 steps per
and they'll run like 200 steps per
second it's really really
sad so you can lose more than 99% of
sad so you can lose more than 99% of
your performance
your performance
even okay so if you're not targeting
even okay so if you're not targeting
anything
um oh this is if you are targeting
um oh this is if you are targeting
something because it's not equal to
something because it's not equal to
negative 1 yeah Target get
entity and then we literally just copy
entity and then we literally just copy
this this thing don't we for now until
this this thing don't we for now until
we make a more generic
we make a more generic
one do you have different types of
one do you have different types of
minions I don't have different types of
minions I don't have different types of
minions yet but yesterday we added five
minions yet but yesterday we added five
different hero types Ty um so we might
different hero types Ty um so we might
once I add the range checks in we might
once I add the range checks in we might
do like different range minions at the
do like different range minions at the
very least and we might stat them
very least and we might stat them
differently but for now we do have
differently but for now we do have
different hero types not different
different hero types not different
minion types
yet let's see so you get
yet let's see so you get
the destination L2 distance gets
the destination L2 distance gets
attacked and you pass to the targets
attacked and you pass to the targets
okay so this is
okay so this is
reasonable um this is
reasonable um this is
reasonable they pass towards you
reasonable they pass towards you
they
attack I think we'll break this out into
attack I think we'll break this out into
a function
eventually to do duplicate
code else uh and this is the one that's
code else uh and this is the one that's
going to be different so this is it's
going to be different so this is it's
trying to autocomplete right now from
trying to autocomplete right now from
the previous one uh this is not going to
the previous one uh this is not going to
be correct it's actually much simpler
be correct it's actually much simpler
all we have to do is creep
all we have to do is creep
path
path
um
um
to creep spawn y spawn X and that's it
to creep spawn y spawn X and that's it
so if they're not aggroed to you they
so if they're not aggroed to you they
will just go back to their camp and
will just go back to their camp and
that's the entirety of the neutral
that's the entirety of the neutral
AI um so all we really need is the spawn
AI um so all we really need is the spawn
function now the spawn function is hard
function now the spawn function is hard
only because there are a lot of
only because there are a lot of
hardcoded positions that's the only
reason void spawn
reason void spawn
neutral that's the correct
PID let's see what the auto complete
PID let's see what the auto complete
does for
us
um yeah we we don't need this team
thing we do need
entity entity
entity entity
neutral the
tower so that's nice
than
I think we really just have to do um
I think we really just have to do um
this is like self. neutral spawns right
this is like self. neutral spawns right
of idx0 something like this
right like this is the only challenging
right like this is the only challenging
thing is that we have to write out all
thing is that we have to write out all
the positions let me see if there's uh
the positions let me see if there's uh
stuff
stuff
here oh and then you call respawn
here oh and then you call respawn
obviously right
obviously right
let's see if let's see what this
missed so PID
type health max health
type health max health
Team Lane doesn't matter Waypoint
Team Lane doesn't matter Waypoint
doesn't
doesn't
matter then these spawn functions yeah
matter then these spawn functions yeah
this is
this is
good
um where does it even spawn the creeps
um where does it even spawn the creeps
the the positions I guess we do that
separately so I think we're already at
separately so I think we're already at
the point where we need to mess with the
the point where we need to mess with the
map a whole bunch
right I really wish I could just get all
right I really wish I could just get all
the data from the DOTA
the data from the DOTA
map and just duplicate it
but or maybe there's some way we can
is there some way I can mark it on the
is there some way I can mark it on the
map
map
maybe that'd be really cool because then
maybe that'd be really cool because then
I could just move stuff around
right and then I'd have something cool
right and then I'd have something cool
to show as well
we can try it we can try that I think
we can try it we can try that I think
that's worth a little bit of time
that's worth a little bit of time
investment so what we have for this map
investment so what we have for this map
right now
is not this it's this
one set the opacity of this to like
one set the opacity of this to like
60 okay so this is nice so now we can we
60 okay so this is nice so now we can we
can edit this
can edit this
um I'm trying to think how I want to go
um I'm trying to think how I want to go
about doing
this didn't somebody link me the DOTA
this didn't somebody link me the DOTA
map like they had a repo or something
map like they had a repo or something
with the DOTA map
project let say ises anybody like this
joke oops
joke oops
nope nobody likes this
nope nobody likes this
joke demo looks real cool
though uh I don't know if I have the tab
though uh I don't know if I have the tab
maybe I can just Google
it DOTA map data
GitHub custom game for dumping DOTA map
GitHub custom game for dumping DOTA map
entity coordinate
data is this
it coordinates of all maps of buildings
it coordinates of all maps of buildings
trees shops Etc
coordinates of
coordinates of
all untraversable
tiles this is actually really useful
tiles this is actually really useful
right hey how are things going today
right hey how are things going today
they're going well um I think we're
they're going well um I think we're
going to get a little bit stuck on good
going to get a little bit stuck on good
mapping today is what's going to
mapping today is what's going to
happen this would be really good right
happen this would be really good right
here this would be really good
tree
elevation
ENT stitch together horizontal this
ENT stitch together horizontal this
is I might even just be able to take
is I might even just be able to take
this image unless there's is there other
this image unless there's is there other
entity data that I can use
welcome coded welcome to the
welcome coded welcome to the
stream I'm currently trying to figure
stream I'm currently trying to figure
out we're implementing neutrals right
out we're implementing neutrals right
now and I just added um I just added
now and I just added um I just added
spawn and AI stuff but I don't want to
spawn and AI stuff but I don't want to
have to go manually figure out the
have to go manually figure out the
coordinates of every single neutral uh I
coordinates of every single neutral uh I
will if I have to but it would be way
will if I have to but it would be way
nicer if I could just get like um some
nicer if I could just get like um some
sort of nav grid type thing like this
sort of nav grid type thing like this
and also get the coordinates of
and also get the coordinates of
everything though now that I'm looking
everything though now that I'm looking
at this is this actually what the DOTA
at this is this actually what the DOTA
map looks like I thought there's
um what about like the trees at the
um what about like the trees at the
bottom I guess the trees just obscure
bottom I guess the trees just obscure
Vision they don't like you can walk
Vision they don't like you can walk
through trees but they obscure Vision
through trees but they obscure Vision
right that's why this is all white over
right that's why this is all white over
here
grid nav
grid nav
data coordinates of all
traversable elevation data map
traversable elevation data map
Dimensions but they don't have
Dimensions but they don't have
coordinates of like
coordinates of like
where all the NPCs are
where all the NPCs are
right process spawner
they have this process
they have this process
neutrals and this goes
neutrals and this goes
into map dat. Json it looks
like
read no this is a read from map data
neutral type pole
type where does it write this data
type where does it write this data
to does it not write this data
anywhere this is exactly what I
anywhere this is exactly what I
want um
is there a reason be behind attempting
is there a reason be behind attempting
to emulate DOTA does it provide external
to emulate DOTA does it provide external
reach into RL or is it just for
reach into RL or is it just for
fun
so yes uh there's not a reason for me to
so yes uh there's not a reason for me to
copy it
copy it
exactly um the reason that I'm doing
exactly um the reason that I'm doing
this for the map data is because I don't
this for the map data is because I don't

whoops Okay so we've got
whoops Okay so we've got
this
this
um now we've got map dat.
Json I think that this is supposed to be
well this is python 2 which is
well this is python 2 which is
awkward process neutrals what
happens oh did they not include this
shoot I figured it would be in the map
data wait
data wait
wait is this not
wait is this not
it neutral
it neutral
type hold
on what is
on what is
this what is this repo
here okay so they have the neutral camps
here okay so they have the neutral camps
in
in
here right
oh but this is just the names isn't
oh but this is just the names isn't
it
it
wait k of
wait k of
name okay this is
gigantic see
gigantic see
you what the heck kind of confused as to
you what the heck kind of confused as to
what is going on here like if I have the
what is going on here like if I have the
data that I need or
data that I need or
not
um list has no attribute
Keys oh is this it
Keys oh is this it
wait
name 1 2 3
name I think these are the chords I need
name I think these are the chords I need
aren't
they it looks like these are the spawn
they it looks like these are the spawn
positions of the uh the
positions of the uh the
minions right
so all I would need to do is figure out
so all I would need to do is figure out
how to convert these coordinates
right all I need to do is figure out how
right all I need to do is figure out how
to convert these coordinates
of course we still don't have like their
of course we still don't have like their
health and stuff
right but I could make like a config of
right but I could make like a config of
some sort right I could make like a
some sort right I could make like a
config file and I could start it by
config file and I could start it by
exporting this
stuff let's try
that so first of all
here um
here um
save what do I want
save what do I want
yaml Json
okay
so data equals
so data equals
this then what we do is we'll
do
do
uh for
okay well we have these Keys now right
it' be nice to have this in a yaml to be
honest yeah let's do
[Music]
[Music]
okay and then what we'll do
is we'll do uh Camp
is we'll do uh Camp
name K and name
Camp
Camp
name Camp
data
or okay
if
um e
um e
n 2
n 2
three well let's not do
three well let's not do
that
split Camp data e
how is this again I don't know what the
how is this again I don't know what the
data looks like hold on
subject
name KV in subject. items K is
name KV in subject. items K is
name
name
continue Camp data K is V this is good
and then we do like
this
whoops
whoops
okay start a
okay start a
pend
uh we don't need this anymore
process okay so this is what we wanted
right now we've got uh we've got all our
right now we've got uh we've got all our
data in
here we will grab
we're going to make this an INT as well
we're going to make this an INT as well
convenience and what is the DOTA
convenience and what is the DOTA
coordinate
system what
z z is the center of the
map the map is this many
units okay
so it looks like they're using the
so it looks like they're using the
negative the negative
negative the negative
system so
we could copy the
we could copy the coordinate system it's
we could copy the coordinate system it's
going to make the grid partitioning a
going to make the grid partitioning a
little harder though if we do
that that going to make it substantially
harder uh we could also
we can divide these by what is this 128
we can divide these by what is this 128
or
something this is
138 that did not
work so 138 by 130 I
work so 138 by 130 I
guess and then we got to divide by two
guess and then we got to divide by two
again I
again I
think so divide by
think so divide by
two
69 65 69 by 65
so I think we have
so I think we have
to let me
see X and Y
[Music]
[Music]
over what's
this x is the bigger
this x is the bigger
one so divide by
69 and then we also have
69 and then we also have
to add 69 I
think and then this is 65
let's see what this looks
like okay so these are still not quite
like okay so these are still not quite
scaled uh I see a 136 here this is too
big 119 134 okay so this did not quite
big 119 134 okay so this did not quite
work to
work to
scale I wonder why not and also the Y's
scale I wonder why not and also the Y's
are uh still
are uh still
negative so that absolutely did not work
negative so that absolutely did not work
to
to
scale oh I think I needed to not divide
scale oh I think I needed to not divide
by two
by two
right yeah
duh wait I'm very
confused yeah there's no way to that I
confused yeah there's no way to that I
okay I'm just doing it
okay I'm just doing it
stupid this should
be
138 and this
138 and this
is
130 let's see if that gives us good
130 let's see if that gives us good
yaml uh I'm still seeing
okay so they're all positive
now oh I I understand um I had to add
now oh I I understand um I had to add
right I had to add 138 over two
okay + 138 / 2
okay + 138 / 2
2 and now if uh does this look like good
2 and now if uh does this look like good
scale
scale
data everything should be positive and
data everything should be positive and
less than
less than
128 which if we're looking at
128 which if we're looking at
it it
is so that's actually not very bad we
is so that's actually not very bad we
managed to get ourselves accurate data
managed to get ourselves accurate data
for all of the camps
for all of the camps
right for
M
M
MOBA
okay and we also want the map while
okay and we also want the map while
we're here don't
we little bit surprised as to how they
we little bit surprised as to how they
have the rendering done
have the rendering done
here grid nav like this grid nav is
here grid nav like this grid nav is
really good but it's the wrong it's not
really good but it's the wrong it's not
a reasonable
a reasonable
size
what so where's the
what so where's the
render process
render process
data to
data to
generate okay so process data.
Pi grid width grid
height where's grid width and grid
height where's grid width and grid
height
okay so they're dividing it into
okay so they're dividing it into
64 by 64 chunks it looks like
64 by 64 chunks it looks like
right 64x 64
chunks so maybe that's the size of the
chunks so maybe that's the size of the
map that we need to
map that we need to
have that's very big
but if that's actually the resolution of
but if that's actually the resolution of
the DOTA map we can use
that so we're going to have to redo this
that so we're going to have to redo this
we're goingon to have to redo a bunch of
we're goingon to have to redo a bunch of
stuff I think
um I'm going to start by just taking the
um I'm going to start by just taking the
image and rescaling it for now but we're
image and rescaling it for now but we're
going to we're going to resize the map
going to we're going to resize the map
uh correctly afterwards so we're going
uh correctly afterwards so we're going
to also just copy this uh what is
to also just copy this uh what is
this map do something where's the image
Doc's
guide grid nav.png
image grid.png
oh
oh
and is there a quick
and is there a quick
resize size image I had a library for
resize size image I had a library for
this
before convert
where's the convert command
from it's image
from it's image
magic that's fine
wait is it where did I see it was 320
by
by
properties 26 260 by 260
okay that's interesting that this is
symmetrical we will
symmetrical we will
umt
this actually that's really close to 128
this actually that's really close to 128
by isn't it yeah that's really really
by isn't it yeah that's really really
close to 128 12
close to 128 12
256 so I actually don't even need this
256 so I actually don't even need this
we're just going to resize it by
half okay so what we're going to do
half okay so what we're going to do
is we're going to
do instead of DOTA bit map we're going
do instead of DOTA bit map we're going
to
to
do map for
I think we have to take two pixels off
I think we have to take two pixels off
right like this
right so I have to fix syon
errors what the heck happened
here oh it the set up fine
we'll fix some scon bugs real quick this
we'll fix some scon bugs real quick this
is just the initial uh the neutral stuff
is just the initial uh the neutral stuff
that I
added uh
added uh
411 reap this
411 reap this
is
neutral
neutral
neutral neutral
oops and almost done and just a few
oops and almost done and just a few
little uh omissions it looks
little uh omissions it looks
like get neutral we don't have a
like get neutral we don't have a
get we need a get neutral function we go
get we need a get neutral function we go
here just move stuff around get
here just move stuff around get
neutral and
neutral and
um I think what we said we wanted to do
um I think what we said we wanted to do
here was this is going to be idx plus
here was this is going to be idx plus
numb agents
numb agents
right and then this is going to
right and then this is going to
be plus agents plus
be plus agents plus
creeps and this one's going to be
creeps and this one's going to be
plus n creeps plus num
neutrals okay there we
neutrals okay there we
go
go
and I want to render this actually not
and I want to render this actually not
with human mode I want to just see
above yeah this is going to start
above yeah this is going to start
getting very cool very quickly once
getting very cool very quickly once
we're loading in actual Maps
uh I assume this is stuck in an infinite
uh I assume this is stuck in an infinite
Loop somewhere
so I'm going to comment the neutral AI
so I'm going to comment the neutral AI
for now since we don't really need
it we haven't put added any positions
it we haven't put added any positions
either
well that's interesting The View counts
well that's interesting The View counts
on X are broken it looks
on X are broken it looks
like hold on is that the
case this
case this
is oh okay yeah there there's a view
is oh okay yeah there there's a view
count cool it's just not sync to
count cool it's just not sync to
restream for some
restream for some
reason I thought it wasn't live or
reason I thought it wasn't live or
something weird
something weird
broken
broken
um let's
run what the heck is happening why is
run what the heck is happening why is
this so slow to start up
something is like
something is like
looping where do we have
looping where do we have
while oh uh I know why it's the the the
while oh uh I know why it's the the the
creeps
okay we're going to have to uh redo the
okay we're going to have to uh redo the
spawn positions I'm
spawn positions I'm
sure yeah so
respawn is this the only yeah this is
respawn is this the only yeah this is
the only wall
loop we're just going to do this for now
loop we're just going to do this for now
and hopefully not forget to remove it
this is going to mess up our
this is going to mess up our
observations
apparently very
odd spawning PID
let's see what it's getting stuck
spawning zero
apparently
apparently
okay stuck spawn pit
zero
really well we'll
really well we'll
uh we'll leave this in here I guess but
um maybe maybe the grid is not the shape
um maybe maybe the grid is not the shape
that I think it is let's
see no it's got to be the shape that I
see no it's got to be the shape that I
think it is right oh it might be just
think it is right oh it might be just
all walls I don't know what this image
all walls I don't know what this image
is encoded
is encoded
as let's look
here what does it look like in the uh
here what does it look like in the uh
the
the
file ah white is
file ah white is
so I think it's it's just flipped game
so I think it's it's just flipped game
map equal equal zero as
well this going to be so
well this going to be so
cool this is going to be really just
cool this is going to be really just
ridiculously
cool oh look at
cool oh look at
this holy hell
this holy hell
[Music]
[Music]
dude that is
sweet look at
sweet look at
that it doesn't seem like it even fully
that it doesn't seem like it even fully
loaded it correctly but it's still so
cool
man holy
there should be um a strip of black over
there should be um a strip of black over
here shouldn't
there hold
on 128 by 128
why does this say
zero right here there's a black isn't
there oh yeah black is supposed to be
there oh yeah black is supposed to be
wall so this should be
fine let's see
why is right here why is there
why is right here why is there
no there's no strip
no there's no strip
of of anything there I clearly see it
of of anything there I clearly see it
right here you
know I get the right
file
file
wait looks the same
image grid nav
yeah map let's say
yeah map let's say
1001 is
zero wait maybe I just cut it off
zero wait maybe I just cut it off
I don't think so
but 0 0
but 0 0
0 but wait it is supposed to be zero
0 but wait it is supposed to be zero
isn't
isn't
it there is
it there is
black
black
so wait what
why is there no wall here
what does this look like over
here there's this big border around it
here there's this big border around it
right oh I know why it's because I'm
right oh I know why it's because I'm
clipping it in the view
clipping it in the view
stupid just don't be stupid
yeah I'm clipping Vision
yeah I'm clipping Vision
off forgot about
off forgot about
that here way
that here way
better there we
go that's some
go that's some
DOTA yeah that's some DOTA right
DOTA yeah that's some DOTA right
there we got some stuff to fix with it
there we got some stuff to fix with it
but that's definitely some DotA
that's basically
perfect now we need uh other positional
perfect now we need uh other positional
data I guess
data I guess
so why don't we just use this for
so why don't we just use this for
everything right let's go if we can go
everything right let's go if we can go
get the tower
get the tower
positions

right I'm going to take a quick
right I'm going to take a quick
screenshot of this for
screenshot of this for

there we
go for
isn't there processed Towers in here
isn't there processed Towers in here
somewhere I thought I saw a processed
somewhere I thought I saw a processed
Towers when I was doing this before
Lane's neutral
Lane's neutral
spawners is it map
data for
so it looks like they have um this
so it looks like they have um this
process map data
here there is um
here there is um
something was this
it no
it no
84 bottom of this file here
so I think inside of this map data
so I think inside of this map data
file we have our Towers
right oh yeah there is a tower key down
right oh yeah there is a tower key down
here
right key is trigger
multiple old type trigger name
they've got Fort and
[Music]
Fountain where did I uh where did I do
Fountain where did I uh where did I do
this oops
map data Json yeah here
well that's a lot of Tower
data literally has their help and

what is a fort there's Fort and

game and this is algorithmically hard
for different reasons but also there's

just like a ton of infrastructure and
just like a ton of infrastructure and
Engineering around you know getting
Engineering around you know getting
stuff to play nice with simulators um
stuff to play nice with simulators um
and in research we like to have really
and in research we like to have really
high performance simulators so that we
high performance simulators so that we
can you know iterate on a bunch of
can you know iterate on a bunch of
experiments fast and develop new methods
experiments fast and develop new methods
and such such that when we go have to
and such such that when we go have to
deal with a a slower simulator you know
deal with a a slower simulator you know
we kind of understand how everything
we kind of understand how everything
works and we can make progress there
works and we can make progress there
much more quickly without having to run
much more quickly without having to run
as many experiments on the slow

so we'll start with just the towers I
so we'll start with just the towers I
guess we'll do

Tower okay so the learning aspect of RL
Tower okay so the learning aspect of RL
is partly a blat box not

really same as other areas of deep
really same as other areas of deep
learning algorithms are slightly
learning algorithms are slightly
different but it's all like back
different but it's all like back
propagation based
here's the learning
code
code
so here is data we've already collected
so here is data we've already collected
from the environment previously we go
from the environment previously we go
back and forth between collecting data
back and forth between collecting data
and training on
and training on
it um so here we're running the
it um so here we're running the
network this is where we have you know
network this is where we have you know
some losses that we calculate as you
some losses that we calculate as you
would in supervised
would in supervised
learning there are a few more losses
learning there are a few more losses
than normal normal an RL but nothing big
than normal normal an RL but nothing big
and here's your normal lost backwards
and here's your normal lost backwards
zero
zero
grad same as the rest of deep learning
I think all we have to do
is we get rid of this
right why do people say the hidden layer
right why do people say the hidden layer
in neural Nets are Black

um generally people who know what
um generally people who know what
they're talking about don't say that
they're talking about don't say that
um that's like kind of an old

perspective on stuff or like a naive
perspective on stuff or like a naive
perspective like yeah you can't ask it
perspective like yeah you can't ask it
to explain its reasoning but that
to explain its reasoning but that
doesn't mean that we don't have tools
doesn't mean that we don't have tools
for understanding you know how these
for understanding you know how these
things are learning at least
partially that that interpretation was
partially that that interpretation was
like popular in maybe like 2016 or
like popular in maybe like 2016 or
whatever
whatever
but things have gotten a bit
better we also we have lots of ways to
better we also we have lots of ways to
visualize how decisions are taken
visualize how decisions are taken
especially in reinforcement learning it
especially in reinforcement learning it
just it takes a little bit of work as
just it takes a little bit of work as
well because your network doesn't speak
English this run
well yeah it's a easier to keep up when
well yeah it's a easier to keep up when
it's your full-time job right really way
it's your full-time job right really way
more than my full-time
more than my full-time

integers what did I do oh this

is it or sub dick
wait
why does it do origin like this this is
why does it do origin like this this is
so
so
gross um it should know to just
like
there I mean yeah this
there I mean yeah this
is I actually don't even keep up all
is I actually don't even keep up all
that well with recent literature
that well with recent literature
um I keep up obviously with like major
um I keep up obviously with like major
advancements in
advancements in
RL um but yeah this is definitely this
RL um but yeah this is definitely this
is what I do like all the
is what I do like all the
time substantially more than a full-time

job
really okay so we've got the
really okay so we've got the
camps perfect so we've got all the

towers
and all the
and all the

convention and these positions all look

good as
well we have this copy function
somewhere

yeah
yeah
uh data do

we're going to load in

first but
first but
uh yeah
so something weird is happening with
so something weird is happening with
these towers huh
these towers huh
because tower
Tower is it a different coordinate
system oh it might be a different
system oh it might be a different
coordinate system I might just
be 0 0 is the
be 0 0 is the
center uh and the other one is bottom
center uh and the other one is bottom
left corner the map I
left corner the map I
believe so I'm using the top left corner
believe so I'm using the top left corner
of the map how would that change
things I've been coding in Python for a
things I've been coding in Python for a
few
few
months very good oh welcome
pretty confused with what's wrong
here let me go look at the DOTA
map yeah this is what I thought it was
map yeah this is what I thought it was
right so you've got
one two three it's very simle simple
right good
right good
afternoon we loaded up uh the DOTA
afternoon we loaded up uh the DOTA
map I'm trying to get the towers placed
map I'm trying to get the towers placed
correctly loading uh the positions from
correctly loading uh the positions from
the game
files I think I have one of the
files I think I have one of the
transforms wrong or something so the mid
transforms wrong or something so the mid
Towers look like they are
Towers look like they are
correct but then why are there
no wait one two
no wait one two
three why the other Towers is not in the
three why the other Towers is not in the
right
spot actually these mid ones are maybe
spot actually these mid ones are maybe
like they're maybe offset a little bit
like they're maybe offset a little bit
but they're not bad
right maybe I just should open up the
right maybe I just should open up the
file and see if the positions I
file and see if the positions I
calculated look
calculated look
reasonable
uh
uh
so bad guys bot
so bad guys bot
one this y chord is too small
so I think I have to flip
it does this make any sense if I flip it
poer
poer
lib poer
lib
lib
MOA
neutrals okay
I forgot to
okay how did you extract that map data
okay how did you extract that map data
yeah there's I found there's a
yeah there's I found there's a
repo no it's not simple
repo no it's not simple
um somebody there's like this random
um somebody there's like this random
repo devil SK
repo devil SK
okay they've
got some very old
got some very old
scripts um from like 7 point
scripts um from like 7 point
something
something
but they also have the extracted game
but they also have the extracted game
files already in it so I can just use
files already in it so I can just use
those game files and just fix up their
those game files and just fix up their
scripts a little
bit but I am not entirely sure
bit but I am not entirely sure
how stuff is um how stuff is being
oriented like I think this has to be
that
right is the map actually
right is the map actually
nonsquare so apparently it's nonsquare
nonsquare so apparently it's nonsquare
but I couldn't
but I couldn't
tell okay what is going wrong here like
tell okay what is going wrong here like
here I'll screenshot it
again
so the mid Towers look reasonable
right and
then Towers over here
are they just
are they just
shifted what's at the top left I I'm
shifted what's at the top left I I'm
spawning stuff wrong which is what's
spawning stuff wrong which is what's
crashing the game um that's why I
crashing the game um that's why I
screenshotted it so that we could see
screenshotted it so that we could see
it
it
um wait actually one two these are in a
um wait actually one two these are in a
line here right these towers are in a
line is
line is
this these look like they're this looks
this these look like they're this looks
like these are supposed to be the top
like these are supposed to be the top
towers and they're just
towers and they're just
shifted
maybe and then this one here looks like
maybe and then this one here looks like
it got moved because this should be down
here so I could have just scaled stuff
here so I could have just scaled stuff
wrong right
looks very possible that I just scaled
looks very possible that I just scaled
stuff
stuff
wrong so what's the correct
scaling what if you give them different
scaling what if you give them different
colors PL on the placement order
colors PL on the placement order
make some guesses as how did they got
make some guesses as how did they got
transformed
transformed
wrong
yeah um let me think how to do
yeah um let me think how to do
that it's kind of annoying to do that in
that it's kind of annoying to do that in
the current because it's like the towers
the current because it's like the towers
are being placed in
are being placed in
scyon hold
scyon hold
on I I just want to look up one thing
on I I just want to look up one thing
first which is the transformation I got
first which is the transformation I got
I got the numbers from this random
site coordinate
system coordinate grid
system coordinate grid
is XYZ
crazy idea why I bother
crazy idea why I bother
extracting overlaying the images and
extracting overlaying the images and
eyeballing
eyeballing
it
it
so it's because I have to figure this
so it's because I have to figure this
out anyways because I also have to do
out anyways because I also have to do
the neutral
the neutral
camps and those are going to be
camps and those are going to be
substantially more
painful so it's kind of worth just
painful so it's kind of worth just
figuring out the
transformation but yeah that's why and
transformation but yeah that's why and
like if I want to add stuff in the
like if I want to add stuff in the
future as well like it's I figured it
future as well like it's I figured it
would be the easiest thing is going to
would be the easiest thing is going to
be to just have a yaml file that has all
be to just have a yaml file that has all
of the game data in
of the game data in
it so if I want to add like a bounty
it so if I want to add like a bounty
Rune I can add a bounty
Rune this also makes it one to one with
Rune this also makes it one to one with
DOTA
DOTA
which I mean unless valve decides that
which I mean unless valve decides that
they hate this project which I doubt
they hate this project which I doubt
given that they went with the open ai5
given that they went with the open ai5
thing right
I think this is going to be pretty nice
let's see what the coordinates say so it
let's see what the coordinates say so it
says the bottom Tower
is according to
is according to
this bottom Tower is at
this bottom Tower is at
78 what about manually ballp parking one
78 what about manually ballp parking one
or two towers and comparing them to the
or two towers and comparing them to the
that's what I'm doing right now
yeah that's what I'm doing right
yeah that's what I'm doing right
now so we
now so we
have
11478 so we have actually several that
11478 so we have actually several that
are on like right around 114
are on like right around 114
here so these should be all in a
line which I guess are
line which I guess are
these right there's one here there's one
these right there's one here there's one
there there's one there
actually if you look at
actually if you look at
this hold on look right
this hold on look right
here right here
here these look like they're just
here these look like they're just
shifted
right how long does it take the game to
right how long does it take the game to
crash not very
long I mean the ball parking is it's
long I mean the ball parking is it's
very close right these are the 113s look
very close right these are the 113s look
I have right here I've got three towers
I have right here I've got three towers
that are at on this line these are the
that are at on this line these are the
three towers that are in a line right
here which one has like a really big x
here which one has like a really big x
coordinate on this
I'm not seeing anything that has a
I'm not seeing anything that has a
coordinate that would go to right here
right oh did I for wait how many Towers
right oh did I for wait how many Towers
am I spawning it looks like they're too
am I spawning it looks like they're too
many right did I just forget to comment
many right did I just forget to comment
out the spawn code on the other
out the spawn code on the other
on that might have been
it does this only have wait does this
it does this only have wait does this
have only game data Towers or does it
have only game data Towers or does it
still have the
still have the
ones yeah that's what I was just yeah
ones yeah that's what I was just yeah
checking there's a little bit of a delay
checking there's a little bit of a delay
on the stream I wish I could make the
on the stream I wish I could make the
delay shorter I think there's like a 15
delay shorter I think there's like a 15
I don't know how long we could time
it well this is
it well this is
commented but wait maybe when it
commented but wait maybe when it
respawns maybe like there's
still on
Tower oh wait what's
Tower oh wait what's
this yeah in the reset right here right
I had it put
I had it put
twice okay so let's this will be cleaner
now and then I think it's just a scaling
now and then I think it's just a scaling
issue from
here 8 to 10 second
here 8 to 10 second
delay isn't that just about right for
delay isn't that just about right for
YouTube I didn't know I thought YouTube
YouTube I didn't know I thought YouTube
always has a bit of the delay I thought
always has a bit of the delay I thought
twitch is the one that's
twitch is the one that's
usually uh like really low latency I
usually uh like really low latency I
could change it in my settings maybe if
could change it in my settings maybe if
there's a an
option boom
twitch is really low
twitch is really low
yeah there's still way too many Towers
yeah there's still way too many Towers
in here aren't
there oh wait the the towers are
there oh wait the the towers are
flipped
right yeah yeah yeah the towers are
right yeah yeah yeah the towers are
flipped mid towers are going across the
flipped mid towers are going across the
river okay so we just got to fix the
river okay so we just got to fix the
trans form and fix the
transform I'm going to be
fun would that happen if I flipped the
fun would that happen if I flipped the
Y yeah that would happen if I flipped
Y yeah that would happen if I flipped
the Y
right let's try this
huh is it still
flipped why is it still
flipped plus 130 one
flipped plus 130 one
over two
right uh
right uh
[Music]
[Music]
process
process
yaml so let's see the mid
Towers maybe X and y are
swapped could be X and Y are
swapped I think that their coordinate is
swapped I think that their coordinate is
starting from the
bottom I'm surprised that it didn't the
bottom I'm surprised that it didn't the
thing that I just did didn't fix
it cuz okay first of all this is
it cuz okay first of all this is
definitely wrong right right uh the
definitely wrong right right uh the
bottom one Tower one for the bottom is
bottom one Tower one for the bottom is
not at y
not at y
51.7 so I think we definitely have to
51.7 so I think we definitely have to
flip the y-coordinate
right because the DOTA coordinate system
right because the DOTA coordinate system
is uh bottom left is 0
is uh bottom left is 0
0 so I think we have to flip that
0 so I think we have to flip that
coordinate so let's uh let's redo that
coordinate so let's uh let's redo that
okay and now
bad guys Tower to Mid
bad guys Tower to Mid
is that looks like where the tower to
is that looks like where the tower to
the mid Tower too should be bad guys
the mid Tower too should be bad guys
Tower one
mid that looks correct to
mid that looks correct to
me Tower three
me Tower three
[Music]
[Music]
mid that looks correct to
mid that looks correct to
me let me see X comma
me let me see X comma
y
y
yeah okay so let's now make sure this is
yeah okay so let's now make sure this is
getting to neutrals.
yaml ah data.
yls yes my number my number system is
yls yes my number my number system is
top left it's just row column uh format
top left it's just row column uh format
so that you don't have to do extra
math perfect I think we got it
now these are offset a little bit wrong
now these are offset a little bit wrong
right like one
right like one
two tier one tier two tier
three the offsets are a little wonky but
three the offsets are a little wonky but
it's very
close right
like this one especially these like this
like this one especially these like this
line of towers here
line of towers here
is is off just a little
bit so close
though let's take a look at the
though let's take a look at the
uh the DOTA M I haven't checked this in
uh the DOTA M I haven't checked this in
a while
a while
for
for
comparison so this one is supposed to
comparison so this one is supposed to
be this is the bridge it's supposed to
be this is the bridge it's supposed to
be like here it's just a little bit
be like here it's just a little bit
off this one is supposed to
off this one is supposed to
be like right here and this one so so
be like right here and this one so so
it's just a little bit
off well our mid and bottom actually
off well our mid and bottom actually
correct
yeah this is pretty much spot
on this one is not right isn't it unless
on this one is not right isn't it unless
the map is changed isn't this Tower
the map is changed isn't this Tower
supposed to be back
here and this one's supposed to be back
here and this one's supposed to be back
this
this
way mid lane in your black and blue
way mid lane in your black and blue
looks really wide
looks really wide
um well that's just cuz trees aren't
um well that's just cuz trees aren't
being drawn
right so if you look here right you have
right so if you look here right you have
this as an obstacle there's a wall here
this as an obstacle there's a wall here
but then all this is
trees so if you don't draw the trees
in yeah I could draw the trees in by the
in yeah I could draw the trees in by the
way that's like a thing we could
way that's like a thing we could
potentially do um I just don't don't
know I don't know if I want to be
know I don't know if I want to be
implementing Vision cover like that
implementing Vision cover like that
Vision cover is kind of
hard we'll see this is a cool project
though let's just Implement a MOA from
though let's just Implement a MOA from
scratch why
not so I think this is something with
not so I think this is something with
our scaling right
in that case they all look shifted to
in that case they all look shifted to
the right eight or so
squares eight or so
squares well this isn't eight or so
squares well this isn't eight or so
squares right the the ones on the right
squares right the the ones on the right
don't seem shifted that much
this lines
up tier one Tower bottom
up tier one Tower bottom
left well yeah these are
left well yeah these are
shifted and the this is shift like these
shifted and the this is shift like these
could be shifted but like why over here
could be shifted but like why over here
do these look
do these look
good right
I mean my transform could be
I mean my transform could be
wrong here let's look at the transform I
wrong here let's look at the transform I
did and I'll try to explain maybe you
did and I'll try to explain maybe you
can catch a bug on this for me that'd be
can catch a bug on this for me that'd be
nice um I think it's just the transform
nice um I think it's just the transform
right
right
so what I did here is um they give you
so what I did here is um they give you
coordinates that are from the center so
coordinates that are from the center so
their coordinate system that they're
their coordinate system that they're
using for this is
using for this is
uh it's like a 2d centered coordinate
uh it's like a 2d centered coordinate
system so up is positive right is
system so up is positive right is
positive but it's Center is 0
positive but it's Center is 0
so uh I computed the scaling
so uh I computed the scaling
factor with uh as
factor with uh as
138 and then
138 and then
130 though it's a little odd because it
130 though it's a little odd because it
is a square map um so I'm not sure I
is a square map um so I'm not sure I
have that perfectly
correct and then I flip the
Y the spacing on the Y turrets
Y the spacing on the Y turrets
correct that's another thing we can
check this one's about
check this one's about
right could the 130 and 138 be swapped
right could the 130 and 138 be swapped
138 it the map is supposed to be wider
138 it the map is supposed to be wider
than it is tall
but the thing is like the PNG that I get
but the thing is like the PNG that I get
of the map is actually
of the map is actually
Square
Square
so I could maybe make the I could make
so I could maybe make the I could make
them both
138 or both
130 well let me think so the
130 well let me think so the
the map is 200 and we should be able to
the map is 200 and we should be able to
compute this actually because hold
on DOTA to Map
size approximately 11,000 by 11,000
size approximately 11,000 by 11,000
what's it exactly
this doesn't say 11,000 by 11,000 this
this doesn't say 11,000 by 11,000 this
says 17 Whatever by
says 17 Whatever by
1600 which is not quite a square I have
1600 which is not quite a square I have
no idea where they're counting from
though so what factor do we get from
though so what factor do we get from
this
664 wait
664 wait
17 divided by 260 is the size of the
17 divided by 260 is the size of the
PNG gives a 67 scaling
PNG gives a 67 scaling
Factor
um but but then what I wanted to do is I
um but but then what I wanted to do is I
wanted to make it to size 128 right so
wanted to make it to size 128 right so
this is how I computed it I did like
this is how I computed it I did like
this and I got the
this and I got the
138 and then I did
138 and then I did
16643 and I got
130 well this website could just be
130 well this website could just be
wrong right
they could both be
they could both be
130 that would give you a shift of about
130 that would give you a shift of about
eight cells wouldn't
eight cells wouldn't
it and then the 130 would squish it let
it and then the 130 would squish it let
me try 130 for
me try 130 for
both I bet you that fixes it I bet the
both I bet you that fixes it I bet the
website's just wrong
X scaler to one yeah
X scaler to one yeah
that's pretty funny how we both get this
that's pretty funny how we both get this
at like the exact same
time okay
see this even
see this even
worse or is this the same
I think these are the same I don't know
I think these are the same I don't know
if this actually got applied
how is it the
how is it the
same that doesn't make sense to
me oh I didn't do it in the I did it in
me oh I didn't do it in the I did it in
the wrong
the wrong
spot I did it in the wrong spot I did it
spot I did it in the wrong spot I did it
to the new I Didn't Do It To The
Towers God so
careless all right here we go boom fixed
careless all right here we go boom fixed
we win we win
we win we win
DOTA we win the
game
game
boom perfect
here you go here's your map the map is
here you go here's your map the map is
good
I
Y has anybody ever noticed that uh this
Y has anybody ever noticed that uh this
is actually the perfect game for puffer
is actually the perfect game for puffer
fish because the map already has a fish
fish because the map already has a fish
on it right here's the eye here's like
on it right here's the eye here's like
the mouth here it's got two fins right
the mouth here it's got two fins right
it's already already got a fish it's got
it's already already got a fish it's got
a
tail literally the perfect game for a
tail literally the perfect game for a
puffer
fish DOTA
fish the puffer Moa
fish the puffer Moa
I guess we get to do neutral creeps now
huh logo basically draws
huh logo basically draws
itself were you around for the
itself were you around for the
continuous control
continuous control
environment I have an environment where
environment I have an environment where
the objective of the agents you have you
the objective of the agents you have you
control a bunch of particle agents and
control a bunch of particle agents and
the goal is for them to fill in the
the goal is for them to fill in the
puffer lib
logo so you get like 4,000 agents that
logo so you get like 4,000 agents that
have to draw out puffer lib
I don't think I got a gift of that one
I don't think I got a gift of that one
that one's actually kind of hard to
that one's actually kind of hard to
solve but
uh have anything cool
here oh yeah we have like environments
here oh yeah we have like environments
like this right like continuous control
like this right like continuous control
like Point environments like this
like Point environments like this
come back to these in a bit but you know
come back to these in a bit but you know
they're fun they also run like well over
they're fun they also run like well over
10 million steps per second so that's
nice okay
nice okay
uh
highx so what we're going to do now is
highx so what we're going to do now is
we're going to do spawn neutrals
and we have to go make neutral
spawns float array neutral
spawns the four
how many neutrals are
there neutral Camp good so this is four
there neutral Camp good so this is four
plus 4
plus 4
8 six uh wait 8 12
8 six uh wait 8 12
20 uh
20 uh
36 36 * 2 72
36 36 * 2 72
neutrals total creeps there are
neutrals total creeps there are
72 creeps
nice so what we're going to do is we're
nice so what we're going to do is we're
just going to do
just going to do
prefix neutral
Camp uh so four team in range of
Camp uh so four team in range of
two and actually we can uh
or team in range two uh if
or team in range two uh if
team prefix
equals uh was is
it neutral Camp
good neutral Camp bad
in
in
range
range
110 come on go full Dynamic and make a
110 come on go full Dynamic and make a
team name array uh this is getting
team name array uh this is getting
stored in a numpy array we're not going
stored in a numpy array we're not going
to do any string processing so once this
to do any string processing so once this
gets it's actually going to get stored
gets it's actually going to get stored
in a m map so this will be stored in a c
in a m map so this will be stored in a c
native data structure so this is slow
native data structure so this is slow
but this doesn't matter this is just on
but this doesn't matter this is just on
a knit
oh
prefix yep and then what we do
is ID x equal
z
z
e
e
five or neutral
entity data of neutral
name
name
neutral I meant so you don't have the
neutral I meant so you don't have the
branching for team name oh yeah yeah
branching for team name oh yeah yeah
yeah we'll clean this up this is this is
yeah we'll clean this up this is this is
a garbage code I'm well aware this is Le
a garbage code I'm well aware this is Le
garbage code Le garbage code complete
garbage code Le garbage code complete
Mee
complet a garbage
code
oops I'm under no Illusions
there okay so
there okay so
spawn neutral
spawn neutral
what's the Sig on this it's just
idx uh we don't need spawn neutral we
idx uh we don't need spawn neutral we
actually just want was it neutral
actually just want was it neutral
pause neutral
spawns
so s
so s
do numpy do zer
do numpy do zer
neutrals
neutrals
2 and then what we do is self.
2 and then what we do is self.
neutral
spawns Y and X we set y and
x and we have entity
neutral don't know if we have anything
neutral don't know if we have anything
to render these guys yet but let's
see neutral Camp bad one
neutral
neutral
Camp oh it's evil not
bad that's so funny how they named it
bad that's so funny how they named it
like they didn't name it radiant and
like they didn't name it radiant and
dire like internally it's just dieser
dire like internally it's just dieser
the bad guys dieser the good guys that's
the bad guys dieser the good guys that's
how you make the video
game okay well this was something it
game okay well this was something it
just didn't it just crashed really fast
just didn't it just crashed really fast
I'm going to try to catch
I'm going to try to catch
it I caught it hold on
okay so it's not actually drawing
them it's not
consistent yeah that's
consistent yeah that's
funny
uh hold on I need to figure
out okay one second
okay we're good
um let me see
so I'm trying to remember where I was
so I'm trying to remember where I was
drawing stuff
drawing stuff
here
the it should be here
right asset map of
right asset map of
tile and then asset map
gets okay so here's the asset
gets okay so here's the asset
map and when you move a neutral what
happens hold on
uh so right
here agent type is neutral
and then you set it to agent
and then you set it to agent
type wait which
is seven so we need to add a color for
is seven so we need to add a color for
neutrals I
neutrals I
believe let's rebuild in the mean
time I don't know why I have all these
time I don't know why I have all these
snake comments
are we even using
are we even using
these no we're not even using these are
these no we're not even using these are
we oh we're using them there
potentially okay well we'll just make uh
potentially okay well we'll just make uh
we'll make it green
okay so this is
okay so this is
is it runs now but I'm not seeing the
is it runs now but I'm not seeing the
neutrals not seeing the neutrals
yet one two three four six s
oops log when it's rendering that's what
oops log when it's rendering that's what
I'm trying to
do oh wait this is not going here
this is the wrong one it because there's
this is the wrong one it because there's
the the other renderer but it should
the the other renderer but it should
still have colors I defined colors for
still have colors I defined colors for
it
it
already uh though it looks like this
already uh though it looks like this
asset map will need to be updated so we
asset map will need to be updated so we
can do
seven no wait this doesn't need to be
seven no wait this doesn't need to be
updated that's dumb
um where's a render
um where's a render
function yeah right here
function yeah right here
so we can just put a break point in here
me
me
grid 0 one two 3 and
four okay so now we have 0o through six
four okay so now we have 0o through six
but no
sevens why does it take so long to
sevens why does it take so long to
build uh well that was the run time and
build uh well that was the run time and
it didn't take so long to build it the
it didn't take so long to build it the
screen just didn't Refresh on my uh
screen just didn't Refresh on my uh
breakpoint so I had to press enter so it
breakpoint so I had to press enter so it
would show the break point that's
all syon does take a quick uh scon takes
all syon does take a quick uh scon takes
a hot second
a hot second
to to build though for
to to build though for
sure spawn
sure spawn
neutral entity type is assigned entity
neutral entity type is assigned entity
neutral is assigned
neutral is assigned
spawn and we forgot to call reset so
spawn and we forgot to call reset so
that would probably do it
so this is how long scon takes to build
so this is how long scon takes to build
uh I'm not compiling multi- thread
uh I'm not compiling multi- thread
because when you compile multi-thread it
because when you compile multi-thread it
screws up your error messages I
screws up your error messages I
found this less than 10
seconds really it would be nice if it
seconds really it would be nice if it
were instant but
well this looks like it's infinitely
well this looks like it's infinitely
looping to
looping to
me
right yeah it's definitely infinitely
looping oh it's
looping oh it's
slow I mean you're a project this size
slow I mean you're a project this size
should be compiling in a quarter of a
should be compiling in a quarter of a
second at most
really it should be compiling too fast
really it should be compiling too fast
for you to
notice that would be the
ideal but the thing is okay a file this
ideal but the thing is okay a file this
small this transpiles to 30,000 lines of

that should be pre comp iling as you're
that should be pre comp iling as you're

did pre-compile like that in the
did pre-compile like that in the

if we go to 5,000 we're defining tons of

yeah
look if somebody wanted to just like
look if somebody wanted to just like
really make good tooling around this it
really make good tooling around this it
would be awesome but

like like the only thing with good good
like like the only thing with good good
tooling around it these days is like

Zig and neither of those help me right
Zig and neither of those help me right
so so this is kind of the best thing out
so so this is kind of the best thing out
there for what I'm
there for what I'm
doing not even kind of it is the best
doing not even kind of it is the best
thing out there by a massive massive
thing out there by a massive massive
margin uh so let's see
margin uh so let's see
why apparently the spawns are like
why apparently the spawns are like
slightly off or
something what if I just do
something what if I just do
this we'll see where it's like it's
this we'll see where it's like it's
failing
cuz I think we're just slightly off
maybe doesn't even
render really
hd.
type
break and good documentation yeah
break and good documentation yeah
well I mean honestly how often do you
well I mean honestly how often do you
use the docs of a language
well this is just like spawning tons of
well this is just like spawning tons of
things it looks like
things it looks like
right it just like spawned them all
right it just like spawned them all
here I
here I
guess so I'm
guess so I'm
assuming ah right here this respawn
assuming ah right here this respawn
function
wait did you get my message
wait did you get my message
about a background
in.net no I think YouTube ate the
comment I did not get that
comment I did not get that
one okay so this function is not
one okay so this function is not
designed
designed
for uh this function is not designed for
for uh this function is not designed for
neutrals it looks like
neutrals it looks like
so we can just get rid of this get rid
so we can just get rid of this get rid
of
this and the only thing we really need
this and the only thing we really need
here
is oops
Health oh we're
good neutral Max Mana
zero
aoom oh we forgot uh we killed the
aoom oh we forgot uh we killed the
respawn function as
well I don't have link filtering or
well I don't have link filtering or
anything enabled so it must be the
anything enabled so it must be the
YouTube link filter I know twitch lets
YouTube link filter I know twitch lets
you post links by default
you post links by default
um but yeah that's weird
well this thing right here looks like a
neutral but it should be there should be
neutral but it should be there should be
green so I don't know what this is doing
green so I don't know what this is doing
here
print and we'll have to
print and we'll have to
um potentially we can even just use
um potentially we can even just use
dota's creep way points I assume it has
dota's creep way points I assume it has
some
right I just move to next
right I just move to next
Waypoint uh okay so right here it's not
Waypoint uh okay so right here it's not
actually these positions did not get
actually these positions did not get
updated so
updated so
neutral
spawns self. neutral
spawns self. neutral
spawns we forgot to increment idx here
spawns we forgot to increment idx here
that'll do
it it's going to be real cool when this
it it's going to be real cool when this
is uh when we have the neutrals
in oh yeah there we
in oh yeah there we
go boom
look at
that is that where the neutrals are
that is that where the neutrals are
supposed to
be they look pretty far apart from each
other aren't these supposed to be like
other aren't these supposed to be like
clusters of of neutrals that are pretty
clusters of of neutrals that are pretty
close or is this how they are
well here's a map that has where the
well here's a map that has where the
camps are
kind of odd
right so
this is actually pretty good this is
this is actually pretty good this is
what we
what we
want
um so like this one
there there ones up top that aren't
there there ones up top that aren't
being caught at all right small neutral
being caught at all right small neutral
camps how many are
camps how many are
there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
14 so this according to the thing that I
14 so this according to the thing that I
have it only has 10 neutral
have it only has 10 neutral
camps
camps
um fact it only gives me one through
um fact it only gives me one through
nine so I think it gives me nine neutral
nine so I think it gives me nine neutral
camps so could just be doing
the medium and larges or
the medium and larges or
something but in that case I should
something but in that case I should
still have a neutral camp like up here
still have a neutral camp like up here
up
up
here so it doesn't look like the
here so it doesn't look like the
positions are
positions are
correct let's see how we are recording
correct let's see how we are recording
the
positions I'm doing y comma X right
dot dot
dot dot
slash
DOTA so in process neutrals we
DOTA so in process neutrals we
have well this is wrong right here so
have well this is wrong right here so
this should be
this should be
minus right so y-coordinate is
minus right so y-coordinate is
definitely wrong this is 130 over
definitely wrong this is 130 over
two minus
this I don't think that's going to fix
this I don't think that's going to fix
it on its
it on its
own but we will run
this process neutrals
where's that move command
so that actually does improve
so that actually does improve
it I
think no not this one
so this
so this
Camp is like
Camp is like
here there's a camp here which has stuff
here there's a camp here which has stuff
in it I'm not getting the camps up
top why are they in this color also they
top why are they in this color also they
shouldn't be in this
color I making it hard to tell them
color I making it hard to tell them
apart from other stuff
entity
neutral agent type equal
neutral neutral is
seven wait hold on
0 1 2 3 four five six
so
yeah okay well that's a little better at
yeah okay well that's a little better at
least
least
now we can tell for sure that we are
now we can tell for sure that we are
drawing
neutrals so here here's the
map clear some missing location data
map clear some missing location data
yeah but like why are they spread out
yeah but like why are they spread out
this
this
far
right like this Camp right
here why are it spawn spread out this
here why are it spawn spread out this
far these don't look to
me not a DOTA play do they have slightly
me not a DOTA play do they have slightly
random spawn
random spawn
locations oh this could be the box
locations oh this could be the box
maybe these could be the the spawn this
maybe these could be the the spawn this
could be a spawn box you're right right
could be a spawn box you're right right
because it uh it listed like one two
because it uh it listed like one two
three four in the data so these could
three four in the data so these could
very well be the spawn
boxes so let's think of it that way if
boxes so let's think of it that way if
these are the spawn boxes and obviously
these are the spawn boxes and obviously
it didn't draw the corners that are over
it didn't draw the corners that are over
you know another thing
yeah they're all perfect rectangles
um are they in the right locations
though I can't tell if they're quite
though I can't tell if they're quite
right or not actually where did our
right or not actually where did our
Towers
Towers
go aren't we supposed to have Tower
go aren't we supposed to have Tower
data where did where did the other
data where did where did the other
Towers
go I don't see them anymore
the
heck we call that a regression
yeah I didn't change the SP the tower
yeah I didn't change the SP the tower
code did I
on right
spawn
spawn
Tower was it really that bad is that
Tower was it really that bad is that
what really what
what really what
happened yeah the towers are not
there towers are just not
there what if I do this
nice looks very DOTA welcome iron
bound iron from the uh the Pokemon Red
Discord long time no see
okay so when I don't spawn the
okay so when I don't spawn the
neutrals it works so I assume that I'm
neutrals it works so I assume that I'm
overwriting the ideas somehow
overwriting the ideas somehow
right yeah I've got to just be
right yeah I've got to just be
overwriting the the
overwriting the the
IDS so num
neutrals agents creeps neutrals Towers
neutrals agents creeps neutrals Towers
is how I have this specified
agent creeps
numb agents creeps neutrals Towers yep
wait 9 * 4 is
wait 9 * 4 is
36 m 2 is 72 no my math is
right what's
right what's
this in PID is idx plus num
this in PID is idx plus num
agents num Towers num creeps this is a
agents num Towers num creeps this is a
spine
okay I'm going to be right back
uh I will be right
uh I will be right
back and then we're going to fix this
back and then we're going to fix this
and we'll change it so that it spawns in
and we'll change it so that it spawns in
spawn boxes instead of spawning in a
spawn boxes instead of spawning in a
specific
spot
e
e e
okay let's uh let us figure out what is
okay let's uh let us figure out what is
wrong with this now
um so these neutral spawns first of all
um so these neutral spawns first of all
are just not
are just not
correct um
are these boxes different sizes or can I
are these boxes different sizes or can I
just like do a A plus minus
just like do a A plus minus
thing they are slightly different
thing they are slightly different
sizes but I think I could also just do
sizes but I think I could also just do
like a plus minus thing
right I was going to pick the center and
right I was going to pick the center and
then I was going to just randomly spawn
then I was going to just randomly spawn
the agents uh nearby like within like a
the agents uh nearby like within like a
three
three
radius or two radius or something like
radius or two radius or something like
that
I could do that
I could do that
right
no that'll be simpler as
no that'll be simpler as
well so let's uh let us do that
not all of those are boxes I don't think
not all of those are boxes I don't think
they're all boxes aren't they which one
they're all boxes aren't they which one
isn't a
box top
box top
left well this one it it didn't fill in
left well this one it it didn't fill in
this corner cuz this corner was a wall
this corner cuz this corner was a wall
right and then like presumably this one
right and then like presumably this one
yeah you can see the bottom corner here
yeah you can see the bottom corner here
so it didn't fill in this top Corner
so it didn't fill in this top Corner
because it overlaps this pixel
so there are a few of them like that
so there are a few of them like that
like this one is also a box it's just
like this one is also a box it's just
this pixel
this pixel
here so I think that they're all boxes
here so I think that they're all boxes
I'm pretty
sure
sure
[Music]
[Music]
mhm
so okay so now we have
so okay so now we have
subdi gives you
subdi gives you
camp and then and now what we can do is
camp and then and now what we can do is
we can just do
we can just do
top left
equals uh
subdi
One X subject to one
X bottom
X bottom
right this is
right this is
four I'm imagining it's going to be four
four I'm imagining it's going to be four
right we can check it and then what we
right we can check it and then what we
do is Camp data
this
x what the
heck
um top left
and we also have
and we also have
to Norm these right so it's this
to Norm these right so it's this
[Music]
over this one
is like this right 13 over2
minus okay
so this is now top
so this is now top
X
plus
plus
this
this
yeah that looks good to me
now we get Center
points should that be y before
X
where uh it's a dictionary so dictionary
where uh it's a dictionary so dictionary
is order invariant it's access by Keys
is order invariant it's access by Keys
it's a hash
map yeah
I forget that not everybody devs in
Python I don't know python gets a lot of

python hate the performance but hey
python hate the performance but hey
that's uh sithon is pretty
nice to be fair though I like python
nice to be fair though I like python
without numpy substantially less
fintech they don't let you do Python and

ah they ought

I think this is actually got to be 18

neutral
spawns neutral in range 1 through
five so this will just be like four
five so this will just be like four
neutrals per Camp

Y don't need this
anymore there 18 camps
right 99 wood cutting on use I actually
right 99 wood cutting on use I actually
didn't play it when I was younger but
didn't play it when I was younger but
um I'm sure I don't have any screenshots
um I'm sure I don't have any screenshots
around do
I
I
uh hold on
uh hold on
actually I totally do on this machine
actually I totally do on this machine

but I played a lot of that game
I don't know Inferno cap and Master's
I don't know Inferno cap and Master's
Helm if that means anything these
days spawn neutral
so what we're going to do is
I don't know where it's getting this
I don't know where it's getting this
Rand int thing
from y
wait seven so
wait seven so
three yeah
I think this does it
right e
out of

oh yeah this doesn't give you you need

well
well
group we in Camp I
think what's camp
no that doesn't work
there something like
this e
really
really
weird move
two possibly these are getting set to
two possibly these are getting set to
zero still
where the heck is
it why is there all this scon spam as
well oh 4,000 something no that's
well oh 4,000 something no that's
ridiculous uh presumably that's
ridiculous uh presumably that's
uninitialized I don't know that's
uninitialized I don't know that's
weird
weird
um no that looks correct uh but why
um no that looks correct uh but why
would it be that value did I mess up the
would it be that value did I mess up the
pre-processing hold on
these
are oh the Y's are totally screwed up on
are oh the Y's are totally screwed up on
this aren't
this aren't
they yeah why the Y is totally screwed
they yeah why the Y is totally screwed

up on
this I messed
have

wait bottom right Y is equal
wait bottom right Y is equal
to oh I forgot to do
to oh I forgot to do
over 130 over
over 130 over
130 right I forgot to Norm these
solid look at
solid look at
that we got neutrals
here they Jitter
around now the question is are these
around now the question is are these
camps
accurate and the neutrals are going to
accurate and the neutrals are going to
fight the creep that's
funny we can always see if they're
funny we can always see if they're
accurate
after we just leave it it's a
after we just leave it it's a
feature
no for
Target I think we need to set their team
Target I think we need to set their team
to something different
to something different
right team
right team
two let's just set them to team
two let's just set them to team
two and then what we'll do
is
is
Target um
Target um
uh if target.
uh if target.
type equals
it's
awkward whole logic is awkward
I mean I could just do
I mean I could just do
CA neutral Target
and the difference is going to
be and then this works
what
happened crash and build calls
happened crash and build calls
what did I not allocate
I don't know why it tried to
do I don't know why it tried to get
do I don't know why it tried to get
fancy here on
me Target
PID I don't know why it it did some
PID I don't know why it it did some
weird thing
there cool so
there cool so
now this
now this
works uh we have to adjust the positions
works uh we have to adjust the positions
of the creeps I
believe I don't know why these guys are
believe I don't know why these guys are
stuck
here but cool
creeps still getting nomed are are
they wait did you see that I didn't see
they wait did you see that I didn't see
that
that
happen creeps are still getting numbed
happen creeps are still getting numbed
by
neutrals oh
neutrals oh
yeah that's weird
well lots of little bugs to
fix let me see if this repo has the um
fix let me see if this repo has the um
the way points in it somehow
so neutral

and these are the way

it'll take a little bit of
it'll take a little bit of
work but uh we should be able to get
work but uh we should be able to get
these
these
into the Json and

then and then we should actually have

think oh but these have to get merged
right so spawner data
dude my eyes just glaze over trying to

read unformatted

something that's kind of crazy some of

the completions are really
nice uh save data list indices must be

okay right because I put this

MPC
MPC
um way points path

so I don't really think there's a reason
so I don't really think there's a reason
to be resistant to um
to be resistant to um
to autocomplete it's just like pay
to autocomplete it's just like pay
attention to what it's

doing it's really well I especially okay
doing it's really well I especially okay
when you're working in Python um even if
when you're working in Python um even if
you have an LSP it's like it's not
you have an LSP it's like it's not
strongly typed so it's kind of
strongly typed so it's kind of
garbage
garbage
so especially for python it's really
so especially for python it's really
nice to
nice to
have that's the main
thing cop it was beta yeah the
thing cop it was beta yeah the
suggestions so this is super Maven I
suggestions so this is super Maven I
highly highly suggest super Maven uh
highly highly suggest super Maven uh
it's way way way faster than copilot as
it's way way way faster than copilot as
you can see the suggestions are almost
instantaneous I think these have
instantaneous I think these have
different numbers of way points on them
different numbers of way points on them
right that's a little bit concerning
but yeah so this is all of
but yeah so this is all of
the this is all the
data and we'll just load this into the
data and we'll just load this into the
file right
I love writing a comment describing and
I love writing a comment describing and
then it writes the whole

basic
basic
stuff I don't usually use it for that
stuff I don't usually use it for that
though I usually use it for like typing

auto complete almost when like I'm just
auto complete almost when like I'm just
implementing like really really obvious
stuff like if I have to set like every

basically something that's been written
a bajillion times and you could just as

easily go grab one from online that's
easily go grab one from online that's
more likely to be correct and not have
more likely to be correct and not have
subtle errors in it
even this will like constantly
even this will like constantly
hallucinate dumb
stuff and this is generally pretty
good okay so way points is now going to
good okay so way points is now going to
be not this because this is garbage
what was the dimensions of this
thing six Lanes by Whatever by two I'd
assume six Lanes like
202 okay
so now with the entity data we will just

unity was the she
C and it could render some bigger Maps
C and it could render some bigger Maps
as well there's an
as well there's an
overhead really big map
this needs to go to a Lane right
hey JBL
hey JBL
welcome we are currently
welcome we are currently
adding uh neutral camps full map and
adding uh neutral camps full map and
we're fixing the pathing for these new
we're fixing the pathing for these new
maps the new
maps the new
map it's really
map it's really
cool as soon as I fix the pathing here
cool as soon as I fix the pathing here
you'll be able to see it with the
you'll be able to see it with the
respawn I
respawn I
mean um
so this is fine for like respawning the
so this is fine for like respawning the
player I
guess how you fixing pathing um cuz this
guess how you fixing pathing um cuz this
is now the actual DOTA map and I loaded
is now the actual DOTA map and I loaded
the way points that the actual creeps
the way points that the actual creeps
and DOTA use so
and DOTA use so
just like
that
mhm
so so obnoxious
so so obnoxious
I hate copying and pasting so much damn
code well self.
code well self.
waypoints Lane 0 0
waypoints Lane 0 0
and zero and
one Andals
brand what is it percent 7 minus 3 I
brand what is it percent 7 minus 3 I
believe okay so this is going to spawn
believe okay so this is going to spawn
near
here you get valid pause equals
true valid
pause move
pause move
to
YX um
[Music]
F valid
F valid
pause has got to be true anyways this is
pause has got to be true anyways this is
fine whatever
all right
one
second all
second all
right so
so spawn at y spawn X
so spawn at y spawn X
right empty valid
pause it works looks like it's fine
we also have to do I forgot the um when
we also have to do I forgot the um when
you respawn the
creep you have to set the way point
to to the.way point got to be set to
to to the.way point got to be set to
one then creep
half
e e
the thing is the way there are different
the thing is the way there are different
numbers of way points now so
key error
zero
oops the heck
there we go
key error zero y but do we have a
print uh right we have to set way points
print uh right we have to set way points
like
this no wa it's key
way so much fumbling around with this
right
so other way around here
if minus one not
if minus one not
in you just
break as soon as I get this working I'm
break as soon as I get this working I'm
taking a break to go grab a
taking a break to go grab a
shake
hungry but hopefully this works Maybe
boom um the creeps appear to have
boom um the creeps appear to have
spawned in the wrong
location spawn creep you give it a lane
location spawn creep you give it a lane
now now don't
you what
you what
happened what
happened what
happened damn this map looks yeah I'll
happened damn this map looks yeah I'll
show you so it's going to look way
show you so it's going to look way
cooler when the creeps are
working this is just the DOTA map like
working this is just the DOTA map like
we loaded this from DOTA data
so it's missing the trees and stuff but
so it's missing the trees and stuff but
this is just the full DOTA
map towers are gone again too damn it
map towers are gone again too damn it
okay well that's got to just be a over
okay well that's got to just be a over
that's like an off by whatever
that's like an off by whatever
error let's fix the darn creeps
[Music]
way points Lane
zero move to
YX
points oh wait this is only three lanes
points oh wait this is only three lanes
right
so this needs to be three times team
so this needs to be three times team
plus
Lane come on work
okay
okay
why we still have the uh NPCs they're
why we still have the uh NPCs they're
all spawned you can see that they're
all spawned you can see that they're
spawned in roughly the right spots even
spawned in roughly the right spots even
but
um huh
3 * TM plus
Lane I
print
Lane one has one way way point one way
Lane one has one way way point one way
point one way they all have one way

I then way points I +
one we just weren't adding the way
one we just weren't adding the way
points
points
correctly but should have still spawned
correctly but should have still spawned
them I would have
them I would have
thought maybe not
uh the they got out now the mid ones got
out interesting
Lane 0 12 8 11
771 oh the start positions are
wrong Maybe
now okay nice
now okay nice
so now this actually looks like it
so now this actually looks like it
works we have the teams
works we have the teams
uh this is not going to run for long
uh this is not going to run for long
enough so I'm going to kill this so that
enough so I'm going to kill this so that
I can run it for longer
here and we're going to see how it
looks okay so missing Towers but let's
looks okay so missing Towers but let's
see how the NPCs
see how the NPCs
look so they are getting stuck at looks
look so they are getting stuck at looks
like some of them are getting stuck at
least the top ones are
fighting and then they just stop
that's
that's
weird hm it's very
weird hm it's very
close something's weird
though I'm going to add a debug type
and I'm going to add uh
and I'm going to add uh
here
debug so uh self.
grid here let's just do
yals one
y
y
x soft.
x soft.
Grid in
Grid in
y set this to debug
y set this to debug
right and
right and
then
then
upgrd
debug and then debug Point here is going
debug and then debug Point here is going
to be
to be
not
not
this uh we'll do like
this uh we'll do like
cyan wees that
right let's try this
this is way points
okay so let's see where the way points
go come
on perfect
so it's not letting me I think it's not
so it's not letting me I think it's not
spawning the
spawning the
agents but let's
see so this
is this is where we have our way points
I think that they this is for both
I think that they this is for both
sides
sides
so little odd
oh I know why this would prevent them
oh I know why this would prevent them
from
from
spawning I could
spawning I could
do nine
do nine
here minus four I don't know if this was
here minus four I don't know if this was
going to fix
anything kind of a big range get big
anything kind of a big range get big
radius to spawn
so that doesn't help
um I think this is is totally screwed up
um I think this is is totally screwed up
right here
differing Dimensions yeah
okay I think these need to be
okay I think these need to be
substantially larger
right it's 30
right it's 30
what's it -
what's it -
two
two maybe like
this possibly these boxes are just too
this possibly these boxes are just too
small
still no
like what even is this
like what even is this
one two
one two
three this is like
eight I can't tell where the hell it's
okay what I'm going to do is I'm going
okay what I'm going to do is I'm going
to just take a look at this this is here
can't even do it that way can I
the
hell why the hell is there's no open
hell why the hell is there's no open
with option is like way down in the
with option is like way down in the
menu
okay so divide by
two 12 and 15
it's like 12 and 15
it's like 12 and 15
right I don't know why the spawns are
right I don't know why the spawns are
not exactly symmetric
what did I say
here 15
Plus Grand percent
uh
uh
minus
5 okay try this
still
still
no
no
so I see this team spawned
so I see this team spawned
here
right team zero
right team zero
128 -
128 -
15 x - 12 I don't know how that's even
15 x - 12 I don't know how that's even
valid
code how the heck is that
code how the heck is that
oh oh yeah I know that is valid code
oh oh yeah I know that is valid code
stupid but
okay so now I
okay so now I
have I don't think that these are the
have I don't think that these are the
things that are screwing it
up I think it's the uh
it's got to be the spawning of creeps
right this
right this
thing let me just make sure oh we got
thing let me just make sure oh we got
better spawning out of that so that's
better spawning out of that so that's
nice
okay so it is the spawning of creep
waves or at least uh let's see if it's
waves or at least uh let's see if it's
the pathing or the spawning
okay it's the spawning
okay so you
okay so you
spawn
idx and
Lane then this calls a respawn
creep re respawn
reap and then what we're going to do is
reap and then what we're going to do is
we're just going to
we're just going to
print Y and
X see what the hell it thinks it's doing
okay well I had to kill the whole
okay well I had to kill the whole
container to get that to
container to get that to
work 94 and 15
is that
bad if I multiply by
bad if I multiply by
two roughly right 94 is going to be like
180 190 like
180 190 like
here 15 is like here isn't it
is that what I I
is that what I I
printed y comma
printed y comma
X so
90 somewhere here and 15 is like
90 somewhere here and 15 is like
somewhere
here I mean is it just like slightly off
here I mean is it just like slightly off
or something
well I'll tell you what we'll
well I'll tell you what we'll
do we
do we
will we'll
will we'll
do self.
do self.
grid this is going to be
grid this is going to be
debug
debug
okay and then we're going to make this
okay and then we're going to make this
like way larger so this is going to
like way larger so this is going to
be uh
be uh
15 and then minus
15 and then minus
7 so
hopefully hopefully now the creep can
spawn come
spawn come
on and still you can't spawn these
on and still you can't spawn these
bloody things
bloody things
along with these
bastards
ridiculous okay what if I do this
now it just works
and most of them actually path what
and most of them actually path what
looks like
correctly and then they get stuck on
correctly and then they get stuck on
this Waypoint
really I don't think these are
correct hold
on good
on good
top Okay so
they end up on the other side of the
they end up on the other side of the
map like they're supposed
map like they're supposed
to so they go up first few way points
to so they go up first few way points
are
are
up and then this is like a corner wayo
up and then this is like a corner wayo
it looks like if they're turning a
it looks like if they're turning a
corner here so they have a few more way
corner here so they have a few more way
points around the
points around the
corners quite a few way points around
corners quite a few way points around
the
the
corners and then there yeah this is
corners and then there yeah this is
definitely valid
good
mid
is yeah definitely they end up pretty
is yeah definitely they end up pretty
much at the
fountain this is bizarre
really really weird that
the well first of all this is me stupid
the well first of all this is me stupid
here this is
here this is
YX so let's fix this that's one bug
YX so let's fix this that's one bug
fixed
and
then and then what do we say we
then and then what do we say we
say end Waypoint creep
Target what do you usually use syon for
Target what do you usually use syon for
do you write the entire environment or
do you write the entire environment or
it or what do you think it is most
it or what do you think it is most
useful for it compared to P yes so I
useful for it compared to P yes so I
write the all of the logic of the
write the all of the logic of the
environment in this um probably there's
environment in this um probably there's
a little bit too much stuff in it now so
a little bit too much stuff in it now so
I'm of the init stuff should be done in
I'm of the init stuff should be done in
Python um but I write all of the
Python um but I write all of the
performance critical logic of the

and compared to pbind um scon has a lot
and compared to pbind um scon has a lot
of nice
of nice
advantages first of all you can mix in
advantages first of all you can mix in
slow operations if they're rare so like
slow operations if they're rare so like
let's say you rarely have to do
let's say you rarely have to do
something but you don't want to have to
something but you don't want to have to
write it out like really exhaustively
write it out like really exhaustively
you can use high level Ops on stuff I
you can use high level Ops on stuff I
use this quite extensively and uh no
use this quite extensively and uh no
more complicated simulators uh it
more complicated simulators uh it
completely bypasses pbind so you don't
completely bypasses pbind so you don't
have to write any pine Shenanigans which
have to write any pine Shenanigans which
makes it way easier for people to work
makes it way easier for people to work
with uh and also the code just ends up
with uh and also the code just ends up
looking a lot simpler I mean it's
looking a lot simpler I mean it's
basically if you're using it naively if
basically if you're using it naively if
you're using it simply it's essentially
you're using it simply it's essentially
um python with types and it has really
um python with types and it has really
really really good numpy support like
really really good numpy support like
they have u m views which are
they have u m views which are
essentially C arrays that have numpy
essentially C arrays that have numpy
array slicing syntax uh there's
array slicing syntax uh there's
essentially a built-in entity component
essentially a built-in entity component
system with numpy structured arrays that
system with numpy structured arrays that
mirror into C structs which is awesome
mirror into C structs which is awesome
so lots of lots of nice things that it
so lots of lots of nice things that it
just gives you um
yeah lots of good things for
cython how much faster is it than
cython how much faster is it than
regular python it is native c-s speed
regular python it is native c-s speed
when optimized correctly native c-s
when optimized correctly native c-s
speed and why not use it for
speed and why not use it for
algorithms uh because well you are using
algorithms uh because well you are using
it for algorithms well not syon you're
it for algorithms well not syon you're
using C++ for the algorithms technically
using C++ for the algorithms technically
right all of the network calls are in
right all of the network calls are in
um are in pytorch right which is backed
um are in pytorch right which is backed
by C++ and Cuda so already is
what is going wrong
here uh lost my train of thought I'm
here uh lost my train of thought I'm
trying to remember what the heck was
trying to remember what the heck was
going wrong
here was it just me trying to figure oh
here was it just me trying to figure oh
I was trying to figure out the way
I was trying to figure out the way
points
we'll give him one
we'll give him one
extra no we'll give them one extra uh
extra no we'll give them one extra uh
creep
path oh well this is the issue right
path oh well this is the issue right
here
so they only had five way points
all right scyon what you got for
all right scyon what you got for
me we have some cool demo here or the
me we have some cool demo here or the
agent still going to be
agent still going to be
stuck I think some of them are still
stuck I think some of them are still
stuck right
that's
weird Okay so they path I don't know why
weird Okay so they path I don't know why
they're pathing here this is weird
so these ones attack
so these ones attack
here and then they attack
here
um I have to watch what happens when
um I have to watch what happens when
that crashes I think I have an idea of
that crashes I think I have an idea of
what's happening but I don't I'm not
what's happening but I don't I'm not
positive I think it's up here maybe when
positive I think it's up here maybe when
this one goes here
this one goes here
no maybe it's one that goes up
no maybe it's one that goes up
here let me just
watch Okay so that red one there is
watch Okay so that red one there is
actually pathing on the the Top Lane is
actually pathing on the the Top Lane is
pathing well it looks like
right Top Lane is pathing all the way
right Top Lane is pathing all the way
down and it passed to the
down and it passed to the
Fountain where it's going to fight this
Fountain where it's going to fight this
uh player character it's going to lose
uh player character it's going to lose
to the player character of
course and we have sever
course and we have sever
several oh they're just AGG gring to uh
several oh they're just AGG gring to uh
to neutrals that's all that's happening
to neutrals that's all that's happening
yeah minion shouldn't be fighting
yeah minion shouldn't be fighting
neutrals that's all that's happening and
neutrals that's all that's happening and
there are a couple pixels up here which
there are a couple pixels up here which
are uh just a little too close for
are uh just a little too close for
comfort
um let's
do okay so
red up
okay creep AI is gets entity
hopefully this now looks good we'll have
hopefully this now looks good we'll have
a cool demo I will then go get myself a
a cool demo I will then go get myself a
shake take about five minutes maybe six
shake take about five minutes maybe six
or seven to do that and then we will uh
or seven to do that and then we will uh
Implement leveling and other things for
Implement leveling and other things for
the next few
the next few
hours but should be a very nice demo
hours but should be a very nice demo
let's
see
see
so
here yep the agents go straight through
here yep the agents go straight through
these debug objects get in the way just
these debug objects get in the way just
ignore those we will uh you know those
ignore those we will uh you know those
will be removed we're missing towers
will be removed we're missing towers
still but the creeps are going to meet
still but the creeps are going to meet
they meet where the creeps are supposed
they meet where the creeps are supposed
to meet right
let's actually get rid of the debug way
points because they're getting in the
way okay get ready this is going to be
way okay get ready this is going to be
cool
you still using the Jitter logic
yep we do it this
yep we do it this
way
way
so they fight in the
middle they fight on the top and my
middle they fight on the top and my
camera's covering it but they fight on
camera's covering it but they fight on
the bottom
two uh White agents
two uh White agents
one they're going to continue pathing in
one they're going to continue pathing in
towards the
towards the
fountain and they are going to stop
fountain and they are going to stop
right where the uh that's where the
right where the uh that's where the
Nexus or whatever should
be you get some
fighting minor you know minor things
fighting minor you know minor things
that could be improved but this is
that could be improved but this is
pretty darn solid I'd say
pretty darn solid I'd say
neutral
neutral
camps
camps
waves full DOTA
map mini
map mini
mooba mini
MOBA it pretty
MOBA it pretty
cool yeah it's pretty
cool yeah it's pretty
cool here comes next wave
I don't like how they get stuck on stuff
I don't like how they get stuck on stuff
so often we might just trim a couple
so often we might just trim a couple
pixels here and there from the original
pixels here and there from the original
map just to make it a little easier for
map just to make it a little easier for
U minions to
path but look at
that tell me that's not
awesome that is so
cool okay I'm going to leave this uh I'm
cool okay I'm going to leave this uh I'm
going to leave this up and it's going to
going to leave this up and it's going to
eventually probably crash or something
eventually probably crash or something
but I'm going to go uh grab a shake do a
but I'm going to go uh grab a shake do a
couple of quick things and then I'll be
couple of quick things and then I'll be
right back and we will
right back and we will
[Music]
[Music]
Implement oh a bunch of stuff we'll
Implement oh a bunch of stuff we'll
probably play it a little bit to test it
probably play it a little bit to test it
we'll Implement uh we'll fix the towers
we'll Implement uh we'll fix the towers
cuz the towers are all messed up we'll
cuz the towers are all messed up we'll
do
do
leveling maybe we'll do some
leveling maybe we'll do some
balancing but this is actually
balancing but this is actually
like this is not terribly far from being
like this is not terribly far from being
a complete thing already
a complete thing already
um I mean this is actually pretty darn
um I mean this is actually pretty darn
close which is
close which is
cool I'll be
back

Kind: captions
Language: en
okay we are
live I'm do a couple quick
live I'm do a couple quick
things while this uh updates and stream
things while this uh updates and stream
starts up
starts up
here so first
here so first
thing is we're going to take a look
at how well this does from yesterday
and
and
oops what's this A th000 ticks or
oops what's this A th000 ticks or
something 20 FPS 50
something 20 FPS 50
seconds do
like something like
this let's 20 FPS
right
right
yep and let's uh let's just put together
yep and let's uh let's just put together
a little demo for
a little demo for
Twitter before we
Twitter before we
start and then there'll be lots of cool
start and then there'll be lots of cool
stuff to
do oops uh we have to
recompile for
let's see how this demo
looks got what I called it
today we're going to be doing uh neutral
today we're going to be doing uh neutral
camps the map is going to look way more
camps the map is going to look way more
like a full DOTA map by the time we're
like a full DOTA map by the time we're
done with this as
done with this as
well and we're going to do a few other
well and we're going to do a few other
things along the way I'm
things along the way I'm
sure but this is going to be a fun day
sure but this is going to be a fun day
and then tomorrow I'm going to try to
and then tomorrow I'm going to try to
like get all this stuff into shape where
like get all this stuff into shape where
we can merge it back up into Dev so
we can merge it back up into Dev so
it'll be easier for people to play with
it'll be easier for people to play with
I put this uh
I put this uh
here okay so this is the gift we just
saved that was a nice little demo let's
saved that was a nice little demo let's
put this on Twitter
and then we'll get started on the
code day five
cool Julian's funny
okay so let's get started on some Dev
okay so let's get started on some Dev
here
um I really like the assassin character
um I really like the assassin character
they all feel okay they all feel decent
they all feel okay they all feel decent
enough
enough
but we're going to have to start on the
but we're going to have to start on the
the neutrals for
the neutrals for
sure morning
Quinn we're doing neutrals
Quinn we're doing neutrals
today I'm on a little bit early because
today I'm on a little bit early because
I've missed half of my
I've missed half of my
breakfast they swapped my order for
locks which many people would take as a
locks which many people would take as a
happy upgrade but I despise
happy upgrade but I despise
locks so instead I'm here having my
locks so instead I'm here having my
coffee being
coffee being
hungry
hungry
um let's see what we're going to start
um let's see what we're going to start
with here
with here
so I think that the neutrals actually
so I think that the neutrals actually
need a different set of
need a different set of
IDs right compared to
IDs right compared to
creeps
because yeah the neutrals need a
because yeah the neutrals need a
different set of IDs compared to
different set of IDs compared to
creeps damn as a Jew I love locks are
creeps damn as a Jew I love locks are
fire oh
fire oh
dude I've been going there's uh like a
dude I've been going there's uh like a
Jewish um
Jewish um
Bakery uh I've been going there for
Bakery uh I've been going there for
breakfast every day love the pastries
breakfast every day love the pastries
they've got great Hala they've got nice
they've got great Hala they've got nice
coffee I wish they had like a good some
coffee I wish they had like a good some
soups or stuff but like it's awesome I
soups or stuff but like it's awesome I
just can't do
just can't do
Locks Jewish Bakery and Jewish deli are
Locks Jewish Bakery and Jewish deli are
like my two favorite damn things that I
like my two favorite damn things that I
wish we had more of
wish we had more of
H can't do Locks though no fish for me
but yeah I actually like what I wouldn't
but yeah I actually like what I wouldn't
do to have a Jewish deli like right
do to have a Jewish deli like right
around here oh
man there was a place when I was growing
man there was a place when I was growing
up that would always have like just the
up that would always have like just the
best damn chicken noodle soup the best
best damn chicken noodle soup the best
like pastrami sandwiches you know you
like pastrami sandwiches you know you
always get like a big bowl of pickles
always get like a big bowl of pickles
with your food it was it was awesome
with your food it was it was awesome
wish we had one of those around
here I think we need to have numb
here I think we need to have numb
neutrals
neutrals
here so I'm going to just add
here so I'm going to just add
it actually it's Towers in Num creeps
it actually it's Towers in Num creeps
num neutrals
I'm neutral like this is
fine oh no they all start they all end
fine oh no they all start they all end
with us so we'll keep it
consistent oh I did do agents creeps
consistent oh I did do agents creeps
Towers like
Towers like
that
okay I don't like
okay I don't like
that agents tow creeps
neutrals agents creeps neutrals Tower
yeah agent creeps
neutrals okay so we'll start here with
neutrals okay so we'll start here with
uh num neutrals
num
num
neutrals 100 is fine
neutrals 100 is fine
I don't even think we need 100 right but
I don't even think we need 100 right but
we'll see what idas we end up
using we'll add what's
using we'll add what's
this num
this num
creeps neutrals
Towers row syntax but
Towers row syntax but
[Music]
whatever I think I can just you can
whatever I think I can just you can
split like this
split like this
right
right
yeah that's
yeah that's
fine so we've got our
entities now we
entities now we
need we need to add neutrals into
here
here
creeps neutrals Towers
Co
all right now we get to start thinking
all right now we get to start thinking
about how we're going to spawn the
about how we're going to spawn the
neutrals
in they're going to be a little
in they're going to be a little
different than the uh the creep waves I
different than the uh the creep waves I
think
cuz like the individual camps have a
cuz like the individual camps have a
respawn
respawn
timer right
we could just give the
we could just give the
enemies well wait there are a few ways
enemies well wait there are a few ways
we can do it
right we can make all the camps just
right we can make all the camps just
respawn at a fixed
respawn at a fixed
interval that would probably be the
interval that would probably be the
simplest
so that I mean that's kind of reasonable
so that I mean that's kind of reasonable
right it's like hey you got to go do
right it's like hey you got to go do
your clear and let's say they respawn
your clear and let's say they respawn
every few minutes so like once you
every few minutes so like once you
finish your clear is when you have a
finish your clear is when you have a
window to go do other stuff in Rome
right of course in Dota it's more common
right of course in Dota it's more common
for uh compared to league right in Dota
for uh compared to league right in Dota
it's way more common for the laners cuz
it's way more common for the laners cuz
there's not like a dedicated jungle so
there's not like a dedicated jungle so
it's way more common for the laners to
it's way more common for the laners to
want to take
camps does that change
anything I think we can just start with
anything I think we can just start with
the global
the global
respawns global respawn timer
let's start
let's start
with in
with in
reset no we don't have to spawn them in
reset no we don't have to spawn them in
reset we spawn them
reset we spawn them
in uh in here I
in uh in here I
believe but we're going to need their
believe but we're going to need their
positions we're going to need their
positions we're going to need their
positions which is a little
positions which is a little
harder and they also need to have uh
harder and they also need to have uh
some sort of ID to them don't
some sort of ID to them don't
they well we'll write the uh the initial
they well we'll write the uh the initial
code and then we'll we'll have to add
code and then we'll we'll have to add
stuff and I'm sure we'll have to change
stuff and I'm sure we'll have to change
the map quite very uh early on here
so we also have to write AI for these
so we also have to write AI for these
things it's actually a little bit more
things it's actually a little bit more
work than I
work than I
thought okay so 1,00
thought okay so 1,00
ticks uh this is to Common we're going
ticks uh this is to Common we're going
to make this 3600
to make this 3600
ticks self Dot
and it's going to be
like how do we do the do it for spawn
like how do we do the do it for spawn
creep
wave Lane creep spawn
yeah so there's like a spawn function of
yeah so there's like a spawn function of
sorts
here and I don't think we need this like
here and I don't think we need this like
this Lane logic we just
need
need
spawn
neutral idx
right and we don't need a neutral idx
right and we don't need a neutral idx
it's literally just
idx okay and then we
do we do
do we do
uh this exact same sort of logic here
uh this exact same sort of logic here
it's going to be neutral is get neutral
it's going to be neutral is get neutral
we have to add a neutral
we have to add a neutral
up
up
here
here
neutral we're going to
neutral we're going to
say get
say get
neutral if so if it's dead we
neutral if so if it's dead we
continue otherwise we update the
continue otherwise we update the
status and we do neutral AI so very very
status and we do neutral AI so very very
similar but not quite the
same so now we need to add the spawn and
same so now we need to add the spawn and
the AI function
functions
um these are actually
um these are actually
both pretty
easy cuz we can reuse the Waypoint
easy cuz we can reuse the Waypoint
system with one Waypoint let's go back
system with one Waypoint let's go back
again with the mooba how's it going it's
again with the mooba how's it going it's
going very well thank you morning
going very well thank you morning
uh we're going to do neutrals today
uh we're going to do neutrals today
we're going to add neutrals we're going
we're going to add neutrals we're going
to expand the map to look way more like
to expand the map to look way more like
a a full scale MOBA uh we're probably
a a full scale MOBA uh we're probably
going to hopefully do a lot of
going to hopefully do a lot of
miscellaneous stuff as well we're going
miscellaneous stuff as well we're going
to add like leveling we're probably
to add like leveling we're probably
going to fix up like attack ranges and
going to fix up like attack ranges and
stuff like that and we're going to see
stuff like that and we're going to see
where it goes from
where it goes from
there I'm hoping this is going to
there I'm hoping this is going to
actually start to look like a a more
actually start to look like a a more
full scale MOBA today I mean of course
full scale MOBA today I mean of course
the thing that's really going to make it
the thing that's really going to make it
pop is as soon as I just get some art
pop is as soon as I just get some art
for the map
for the map
and like maybe some animations for the
and like maybe some animations for the
characters then it'll actually look like
characters then it'll actually look like
a game but we're actually doing very
a game but we're actually doing very
well on the mechanical side like it's
well on the mechanical side like it's
kind of we have a lot of the pieces in
kind of we have a lot of the pieces in
place already just in the four short
place already just in the four short
days so I'll be around here do it all
days so I'll be around here do it all
day it'll be
fun so we've got creep AI
fun so we've got creep AI
we need to add neutral
we need to add neutral
AI going to
do with RL in general is it better to
do with RL in general is it better to
practice build the agent with the
practice build the agent with the
ability to work out the
ability to work out the
features rather than setting X
features rather than setting X
features
features
um oh I see what you're
um oh I see what you're
saying kind
saying kind
of I personally don't do a bunch I don't
of I personally don't do a bunch I don't
do feature engineering type work but
do feature engineering type work but
what I do is uh I rep when I'm building
what I do is uh I rep when I'm building
the game I'm keeping in mind a pretty
the game I'm keeping in mind a pretty
reasonable way of representing local
reasonable way of representing local
state such that I'm not producing a
state such that I'm not producing a
bunch of garbage data right so like
bunch of garbage data right so like
these agents are going to get a low
these agents are going to get a low
reses 2D map of uh essentially different
reses 2D map of uh essentially different
IDs for different agent
IDs for different agent
types that's going to be relatively easy
types that's going to be relatively easy
for them to interpret the one thing that
for them to interpret the one thing that
will be relatively hard and may re ire
will be relatively hard and may re ire
some feature engineering is uh the
some feature engineering is uh the
positions like you might have to make
positions like you might have to make
instead of giving absolute positions you
instead of giving absolute positions you
might have to do it relative to the
might have to do it relative to the
current agent that's the only bit of
current agent that's the only bit of
feature engineering I might have to
feature engineering I might have to
consider with this feature engineering
consider with this feature engineering
is very effective um for solving real
is very effective um for solving real
problems but uh it's also something that
problems but uh it's also something that
you can sink a lot of time into and
you can sink a lot of time into and
doesn't really Advance any of the
doesn't really Advance any of the
fundamentals
fundamentals
so I prefer working on more General and
so I prefer working on more General and
easily transferable stuff like high
easily transferable stuff like high
performance engineering techniques high
performance engineering techniques high
quality hyper parameter sweeps right
quality hyper parameter sweeps right
stuff like
that okay so neutral
AI we do not
AI we do not
need way
need way
points or
points or
Lanes or NE or even necessarily
Lanes or NE or even necessarily
destinations
makes sense yeah I appreciate it yeah
uh rl's going to be so much better and
uh rl's going to be so much better and
in just a couple months it's going to be
in just a couple months it's going to be
crazy like it's going to get so so much
crazy like it's going to get so so much
better so soon like folks don't even
better so soon like folks don't even
know I mean between all these M I've
know I mean between all these M I've
been developing and how fast they are
been developing and how fast they are
and the hyper pram sweeps and stuff
and the hyper pram sweeps and stuff
we're just going to have like a nice set
we're just going to have like a nice set
of benchmarks that train it a million
of benchmarks that train it a million
steps per second
steps per second
and I mean when you have just when you
and I mean when you have just when you
have stuff that runs a hundred times at
have stuff that runs a hundred times at
least faster than a few months ago that
least faster than a few months ago that
just lets you do so much cool stuff I
just lets you do so much cool stuff I
can't
wait of course I don't get to wait I
wait of course I don't get to wait I
have to build it
right I've also got a colleague that's
right I've also got a colleague that's
working on another environment that I'm
working on another environment that I'm
hoping will be ready relatively soon I
hoping will be ready relatively soon I
got to go help help him out with it
got to go help help him out with it
probably but uh yeah I want there to be
probably but uh yeah I want there to be
a lot of these cool environments around
a lot of these cool environments around
problem is they take at least a week a
problem is they take at least a week a
piece to
build okay
so what's creep Target can I reuse creep
so what's creep Target can I reuse creep
Target I can totally reuse creep Target
Target I can totally reuse creep Target
right
yeah so Target pit is reuse creep
Target if Target pit is negative
Target if Target pit is negative
then are you adding a guy for the
then are you adding a guy for the
training or not rendering for now no the
training or not rendering for now no the
the guey is this is a key this is a very
the guey is this is a key this is a very
very important thing in reinforcement
very important thing in reinforcement
learning uh the guey is not for train
learning uh the guey is not for train
time the guey is for people to play the
time the guey is for people to play the
game and to understand what's going on
game and to understand what's going on
um agent should have access to the exact
um agent should have access to the exact
same information that humans see on
same information that humans see on
screen sometimes a smaller crop of it
screen sometimes a smaller crop of it
for performance reasons but the agent
for performance reasons but the agent
should have access to the exact same
should have access to the exact same
information but you do not want to
information but you do not want to
render during training it immediately
render during training it immediately
costs you 99 plus% of your
costs you 99 plus% of your
performance never worth
that only exception to this is if you
that only exception to this is if you
want to think of
want to think of
like in something like the snake
like in something like the snake
environment that I made for instance the
environment that I made for instance the
observations are very very close to what
observations are very very close to what
is rendered um it's just like instead of
is rendered um it's just like instead of
actually rendering the pixels I have an
actually rendering the pixels I have an
index for each color but it's almost
index for each color but it's almost
identical to the observation but that's
identical to the observation but that's
only because in that case like the
only because in that case like the
render ing is basically the exact same
render ing is basically the exact same
thing as the state
anyways but yeah if I were to put it
anyways but yeah if I were to put it
through any sort of gooey Library you
through any sort of gooey Library you
lose all your
lose all your
performance I've seen projects where
performance I've seen projects where
like people will write environments that
like people will write environments that
should run a million steps per second
should run a million steps per second
and they'll run like 200 steps per
and they'll run like 200 steps per
second it's really really
sad so you can lose more than 99% of
sad so you can lose more than 99% of
your performance
your performance
even okay so if you're not targeting
even okay so if you're not targeting
anything
um oh this is if you are targeting
um oh this is if you are targeting
something because it's not equal to
something because it's not equal to
negative 1 yeah Target get
entity and then we literally just copy
entity and then we literally just copy
this this thing don't we for now until
this this thing don't we for now until
we make a more generic
we make a more generic
one do you have different types of
one do you have different types of
minions I don't have different types of
minions I don't have different types of
minions yet but yesterday we added five
minions yet but yesterday we added five
different hero types Ty um so we might
different hero types Ty um so we might
once I add the range checks in we might
once I add the range checks in we might
do like different range minions at the
do like different range minions at the
very least and we might stat them
very least and we might stat them
differently but for now we do have
differently but for now we do have
different hero types not different
different hero types not different
minion types
yet let's see so you get
yet let's see so you get
the destination L2 distance gets
the destination L2 distance gets
attacked and you pass to the targets
attacked and you pass to the targets
okay so this is
okay so this is
reasonable um this is
reasonable um this is
reasonable they pass towards you
reasonable they pass towards you
they
attack I think we'll break this out into
attack I think we'll break this out into
a function
eventually to do duplicate
code else uh and this is the one that's
code else uh and this is the one that's
going to be different so this is it's
going to be different so this is it's
trying to autocomplete right now from
trying to autocomplete right now from
the previous one uh this is not going to
the previous one uh this is not going to
be correct it's actually much simpler
be correct it's actually much simpler
all we have to do is creep
all we have to do is creep
path
path
um
um
to creep spawn y spawn X and that's it
to creep spawn y spawn X and that's it
so if they're not aggroed to you they
so if they're not aggroed to you they
will just go back to their camp and
will just go back to their camp and
that's the entirety of the neutral
that's the entirety of the neutral
AI um so all we really need is the spawn
AI um so all we really need is the spawn
function now the spawn function is hard
function now the spawn function is hard
only because there are a lot of
only because there are a lot of
hardcoded positions that's the only
reason void spawn
reason void spawn
neutral that's the correct
PID let's see what the auto complete
PID let's see what the auto complete
does for
us
um yeah we we don't need this team
thing we do need
entity entity
entity entity
neutral the
tower so that's nice
than
I think we really just have to do um
I think we really just have to do um
this is like self. neutral spawns right
this is like self. neutral spawns right
of idx0 something like this
right like this is the only challenging
right like this is the only challenging
thing is that we have to write out all
thing is that we have to write out all
the positions let me see if there's uh
the positions let me see if there's uh
stuff
stuff
here oh and then you call respawn
here oh and then you call respawn
obviously right
obviously right
let's see if let's see what this
missed so PID
type health max health
type health max health
Team Lane doesn't matter Waypoint
Team Lane doesn't matter Waypoint
doesn't
doesn't
matter then these spawn functions yeah
matter then these spawn functions yeah
this is
this is
good
um where does it even spawn the creeps
um where does it even spawn the creeps
the the positions I guess we do that
separately so I think we're already at
separately so I think we're already at
the point where we need to mess with the
the point where we need to mess with the
map a whole bunch
right I really wish I could just get all
right I really wish I could just get all
the data from the DOTA
the data from the DOTA
map and just duplicate it
but or maybe there's some way we can
is there some way I can mark it on the
is there some way I can mark it on the
map
map
maybe that'd be really cool because then
maybe that'd be really cool because then
I could just move stuff around
right and then I'd have something cool
right and then I'd have something cool
to show as well
we can try it we can try that I think
we can try it we can try that I think
that's worth a little bit of time
that's worth a little bit of time
investment so what we have for this map
investment so what we have for this map
right now
is not this it's this
one set the opacity of this to like
one set the opacity of this to like
60 okay so this is nice so now we can we
60 okay so this is nice so now we can we
can edit this
can edit this
um I'm trying to think how I want to go
um I'm trying to think how I want to go
about doing
this didn't somebody link me the DOTA
this didn't somebody link me the DOTA
map like they had a repo or something
map like they had a repo or something
with the DOTA map
project let say ises anybody like this
joke oops
joke oops
nope nobody likes this
nope nobody likes this
joke demo looks real cool
though uh I don't know if I have the tab
though uh I don't know if I have the tab
maybe I can just Google
it DOTA map data
GitHub custom game for dumping DOTA map
GitHub custom game for dumping DOTA map
entity coordinate

it coordinates of all maps of buildings
it coordinates of all maps of buildings
trees shops Etc

right hey how are things going today
right hey how are things going today
they're going well um I think we're
they're going well um I think we're
going to get a little bit stuck on good
going to get a little bit stuck on good

out we're implementing neutrals right
out we're implementing neutrals right
now and I just added um I just added
now and I just added um I just added
spawn and AI stuff but I don't want to
spawn and AI stuff but I don't want to
have to go manually figure out the
have to go manually figure out the
coordinates of every single neutral uh I
coordinates of every single neutral uh I
will if I have to but it would be way
will if I have to but it would be way
nicer if I could just get like um some
nicer if I could just get like um some
sort of nav grid type thing like this
sort of nav grid type thing like this
and also get the coordinates of
and also get the coordinates of
everything though now that I'm looking
everything though now that I'm looking
at this is this actually what the DOTA
at this is this actually what the DOTA
map looks like I thought there's
um what about like the trees at the
um what about like the trees at the
bottom I guess the trees just obscure
bottom I guess the trees just obscure
Vision they don't like you can walk

reach into RL or is it just for

so yes uh there's not a reason for me to
so yes uh there's not a reason for me to
copy it
copy it
exactly um the reason that I'm doing
exactly um the reason that I'm doing
this for the map data is because I don't
this for the map data is because I don't
want to have to draw my own map and
want to have to draw my own map and
people already know the DOTA map that's

100% use this map file but for the

this 260 is
fine that that might even be

so like if you if you know the
so like if you if you know the
programming fundamentals and you know
programming fundamentals and you know
C++ like it'll take you a few weeks to
C++ like it'll take you a few weeks to
get com fortable with python that's
get com fortable with python that's
about
it doesn't work the other way coming
it doesn't work the other way coming
from python to anything else is pretty
painful C++ is a good starting line
painful C++ is a good starting line
because it's how close to how computer
because it's how close to how computer
actually
actually
works most motivating thing is having an
works most motivating thing is having an
actual problem you want to
solve yeah Roman my one caveat is
solve yeah Roman my one caveat is
like getting like getting bored because
like getting like getting bored because
it takes too damn long to build anything
it takes too damn long to build anything
is a real problem right um absolutely
is a real problem right um absolutely
teaches you fundamentals how long does
teaches you fundamentals how long does
it take like how long does it take to
it take like how long does it take to
learn the syntax of a language not very
learn the syntax of a language not very
long how long does it take to learn to
long how long does it take to learn to
program well in any given language a
program well in any given language a
Lifetime
right I mean like you can look at
right I mean like you can look at
projects that people have built after
projects that people have built after
you know so much time or so much
you know so much time or so much
experience with uh with programming but
experience with uh with programming but
you know
you know
it's it's like saying how long does it
it's it's like saying how long does it
take to to learn English like what how
take to to learn English like what how
long does it take to say some basic
long does it take to say some basic
stuff or how long does it take to uh you
stuff or how long does it take to uh you
know to write war in peace or whatever
whoops Okay so we've got
whoops Okay so we've got
this
this
um now we've got map dat.
Json I think that this is supposed to be
well this is python 2 which is
well this is python 2 which is
awkward process neutrals what
happens oh did they not include this
shoot I figured it would be in the map
data wait
data wait
wait is this not
wait is this not
it neutral
it neutral
type hold
on what is
on what is
this what is this repo
here okay so they have the neutral camps
here okay so they have the neutral camps
in
in
here right
oh but this is just the names isn't
oh but this is just the names isn't
it
it
wait k of
wait k of
name okay this is
gigantic see
gigantic see
you what the heck kind of confused as to
you what the heck kind of confused as to
what is going on here like if I have the
what is going on here like if I have the
data that I need or
data that I need or
not
um list has no attribute
Keys oh is this it
Keys oh is this it
wait
name 1 2 3
name I think these are the chords I need
name I think these are the chords I need
aren't
they it looks like these are the spawn
they it looks like these are the spawn
positions of the uh the
positions of the uh the
minions right
so all I would need to do is figure out
so all I would need to do is figure out
how to convert these coordinates
right all I need to do is figure out how
right all I need to do is figure out how
to convert these coordinates
of course we still don't have like their
of course we still don't have like their
health and stuff
right but I could make like a config of
right but I could make like a config of
some sort right I could make like a
some sort right I could make like a
config file and I could start it by
config file and I could start it by
exporting this
stuff let's try
that so first of all
here um
here um
save what do I want
save what do I want
yaml Json
okay
so data equals
so data equals
this then what we do is we'll
do
do
uh for
okay well we have these Keys now right
it' be nice to have this in a yaml to be
honest yeah let's do
[Music]
[Music]
okay and then what we'll do
is we'll do uh Camp
is we'll do uh Camp
name K and name
Camp
Camp
name Camp
data
or okay
if
um e
um e
n 2
n 2
three well let's not do
three well let's not do
that
split Camp data e
how is this again I don't know what the
how is this again I don't know what the
data looks like hold on
subject
name KV in subject. items K is
name KV in subject. items K is
name
name
continue Camp data K is V this is good
and then we do like
this
whoops
whoops
okay start a
okay start a
pend
uh we don't need this anymore
process okay so this is what we wanted
right now we've got uh we've got all our
right now we've got uh we've got all our
data in
here we will grab
we're going to make this an INT as well
we're going to make this an INT as well
convenience and what is the DOTA
convenience and what is the DOTA
coordinate
system what
z z is the center of the
map the map is this many
units okay
so it looks like they're using the
so it looks like they're using the
negative the negative
negative the negative
system so
we could copy the
we could copy the coordinate system it's
we could copy the coordinate system it's
going to make the grid partitioning a
going to make the grid partitioning a
little harder though if we do
that that going to make it substantially
harder uh we could also
we can divide these by what is this 128
we can divide these by what is this 128
or
something this is
138 that did not
work so 138 by 130 I
work so 138 by 130 I
guess and then we got to divide by two
guess and then we got to divide by two
again I
again I
think so divide by
think so divide by
two
69 65 69 by 65
so I think we have
so I think we have
to let me
see X and Y
[Music]
[Music]
over what's
this x is the bigger
this x is the bigger
one so divide by
69 and then we also have
69 and then we also have
to add 69 I
think and then this is 65
let's see what this looks
like okay so these are still not quite
like okay so these are still not quite
scaled uh I see a 136 here this is too
big 119 134 okay so this did not quite
big 119 134 okay so this did not quite
work to
work to
scale I wonder why not and also the Y's
scale I wonder why not and also the Y's
are uh still
are uh still
negative so that absolutely did not work
negative so that absolutely did not work
to
to
scale oh I think I needed to not divide
scale oh I think I needed to not divide
by two
by two
right yeah
duh wait I'm very
confused yeah there's no way to that I
confused yeah there's no way to that I
okay I'm just doing it
okay I'm just doing it
stupid this should
be
138 and this
138 and this
is
130 let's see if that gives us good
130 let's see if that gives us good
yaml uh I'm still seeing
okay so they're all positive
now oh I I understand um I had to add
now oh I I understand um I had to add
right I had to add 138 over two
okay + 138 / 2
okay + 138 / 2
2 and now if uh does this look like good
2 and now if uh does this look like good
scale
scale
data everything should be positive and
data everything should be positive and
less than
less than
128 which if we're looking at
128 which if we're looking at
it it
is so that's actually not very bad we
is so that's actually not very bad we
managed to get ourselves accurate data
managed to get ourselves accurate data
for all of the camps
for all of the camps
right for
M
M
MOBA
okay and we also want the map while
okay and we also want the map while
we're here don't
we little bit surprised as to how they
we little bit surprised as to how they
have the rendering done
have the rendering done
here grid nav like this grid nav is
here grid nav like this grid nav is
really good but it's the wrong it's not
really good but it's the wrong it's not
a reasonable
a reasonable
size
what so where's the
what so where's the
render process
render process
data to
data to
generate okay so process data.
Pi grid width grid
height where's grid width and grid
height where's grid width and grid
height
okay so they're dividing it into
okay so they're dividing it into
64 by 64 chunks it looks like
64 by 64 chunks it looks like
right 64x 64
chunks so maybe that's the size of the
chunks so maybe that's the size of the
map that we need to
map that we need to
have that's very big
but if that's actually the resolution of
but if that's actually the resolution of
the DOTA map we can use
that so we're going to have to redo this
that so we're going to have to redo this
we're goingon to have to redo a bunch of
we're goingon to have to redo a bunch of
stuff I think
um I'm going to start by just taking the
um I'm going to start by just taking the
image and rescaling it for now but we're
image and rescaling it for now but we're
going to we're going to resize the map
going to we're going to resize the map
uh correctly afterwards so we're going
uh correctly afterwards so we're going
to also just copy this uh what is
to also just copy this uh what is
this map do something where's the image
Doc's
guide grid nav.png
image grid.png
oh
oh
and is there a quick
and is there a quick
resize size image I had a library for
resize size image I had a library for
this
before convert
where's the convert command
from it's image
from it's image
magic that's fine
wait is it where did I see it was 320
by
by
properties 26 260 by 260
okay that's interesting that this is
symmetrical we will
symmetrical we will
umt
this actually that's really close to 128
this actually that's really close to 128
by isn't it yeah that's really really
by isn't it yeah that's really really
close to 128 12
close to 128 12
256 so I actually don't even need this
256 so I actually don't even need this
we're just going to resize it by
half okay so what we're going to do
half okay so what we're going to do
is we're going to
do instead of DOTA bit map we're going
do instead of DOTA bit map we're going
to
to
do map for
I think we have to take two pixels off
I think we have to take two pixels off
right like this
right so I have to fix syon
errors what the heck happened
here oh it the set up fine
we'll fix some scon bugs real quick this
we'll fix some scon bugs real quick this
is just the initial uh the neutral stuff
is just the initial uh the neutral stuff
that I
added uh
added uh
411 reap this
411 reap this
is
neutral
neutral
neutral neutral
oops and almost done and just a few
oops and almost done and just a few
little uh omissions it looks
little uh omissions it looks
like get neutral we don't have a
like get neutral we don't have a
get we need a get neutral function we go
get we need a get neutral function we go
here just move stuff around get
here just move stuff around get
neutral and
neutral and
um I think what we said we wanted to do
um I think what we said we wanted to do
here was this is going to be idx plus
here was this is going to be idx plus
numb agents
numb agents
right and then this is going to
right and then this is going to
be plus agents plus
be plus agents plus
creeps and this one's going to be
creeps and this one's going to be
plus n creeps plus num
neutrals okay there we
neutrals okay there we
go
go
and I want to render this actually not
and I want to render this actually not
with human mode I want to just see
above yeah this is going to start
above yeah this is going to start
getting very cool very quickly once
getting very cool very quickly once
we're loading in actual Maps
uh I assume this is stuck in an infinite
uh I assume this is stuck in an infinite
Loop somewhere
so I'm going to comment the neutral AI
so I'm going to comment the neutral AI
for now since we don't really need
it we haven't put added any positions
it we haven't put added any positions
either
well that's interesting The View counts
well that's interesting The View counts
on X are broken it looks
on X are broken it looks
like hold on is that the
case this
case this
is oh okay yeah there there's a view
is oh okay yeah there there's a view
count cool it's just not sync to
count cool it's just not sync to
restream for some
restream for some
reason I thought it wasn't live or
reason I thought it wasn't live or
something weird
something weird
broken
broken
um let's
run what the heck is happening why is
run what the heck is happening why is
this so slow to start up
something is like
something is like
looping where do we have
looping where do we have
while oh uh I know why it's the the the
while oh uh I know why it's the the the
creeps
okay we're going to have to uh redo the
okay we're going to have to uh redo the
spawn positions I'm
spawn positions I'm
sure yeah so
respawn is this the only yeah this is
respawn is this the only yeah this is
the only wall
loop we're just going to do this for now
loop we're just going to do this for now
and hopefully not forget to remove it
this is going to mess up our
this is going to mess up our
observations
apparently very
odd spawning PID
let's see what it's getting stuck
spawning zero
apparently
apparently
okay stuck spawn pit
zero
really well we'll
really well we'll
uh we'll leave this in here I guess but
um maybe maybe the grid is not the shape
um maybe maybe the grid is not the shape
that I think it is let's
see no it's got to be the shape that I
see no it's got to be the shape that I
think it is right oh it might be just
think it is right oh it might be just
all walls I don't know what this image
all walls I don't know what this image
is encoded
is encoded
as let's look
here what does it look like in the uh
here what does it look like in the uh
the
the
file ah white is
file ah white is
so I think it's it's just flipped game
so I think it's it's just flipped game
map equal equal zero as
well this going to be so
well this going to be so
cool this is going to be really just
cool this is going to be really just
ridiculously
cool oh look at
cool oh look at
this holy hell
this holy hell
[Music]
[Music]
dude that is
sweet look at
sweet look at
that it doesn't seem like it even fully
that it doesn't seem like it even fully
loaded it correctly but it's still so
cool
man holy
there should be um a strip of black over
there should be um a strip of black over
here shouldn't
there hold
on 128 by 128
why does this say
zero right here there's a black isn't
there oh yeah black is supposed to be
there oh yeah black is supposed to be
wall so this should be
fine let's see
why is right here why is there
why is right here why is there
no there's no strip
no there's no strip
of of anything there I clearly see it
of of anything there I clearly see it
right here you
know I get the right
file
file
wait looks the same
image grid nav
yeah map let's say
yeah map let's say
1001 is
zero wait maybe I just cut it off
zero wait maybe I just cut it off
I don't think so
but 0 0
but 0 0
0 but wait it is supposed to be zero
0 but wait it is supposed to be zero
isn't
isn't
it there is
it there is
black
black
so wait what
why is there no wall here
what does this look like over
here there's this big border around it
here there's this big border around it
right oh I know why it's because I'm
right oh I know why it's because I'm
clipping it in the view
clipping it in the view
stupid just don't be stupid
yeah I'm clipping Vision
yeah I'm clipping Vision
off forgot about
off forgot about
that here way
that here way
better there we
go that's some
go that's some
DOTA yeah that's some DOTA right
DOTA yeah that's some DOTA right
there we got some stuff to fix with it
there we got some stuff to fix with it
but that's definitely some DotA
that's basically
perfect now we need uh other positional
perfect now we need uh other positional
data I guess
data I guess
so why don't we just use this for
so why don't we just use this for
everything right let's go if we can go
everything right let's go if we can go
get the tower
get the tower
positions
positions
um and like maybe even the creep spawn
um and like maybe even the creep spawn
positions
right I'm going to take a quick
right I'm going to take a quick
screenshot of this for
screenshot of this for
Twitter for
there we
go for
isn't there processed Towers in here
isn't there processed Towers in here
somewhere I thought I saw a processed
somewhere I thought I saw a processed
Towers when I was doing this before
Lane's neutral
Lane's neutral
spawners is it map
data for
so it looks like they have um this
so it looks like they have um this
process map data
here there is um
here there is um
something was this
it no
it no
84 bottom of this file here
so I think inside of this map data
so I think inside of this map data
file we have our Towers
right oh yeah there is a tower key down
right oh yeah there is a tower key down
here
right key is trigger
multiple old type trigger name
they've got Fort and
[Music]
Fountain where did I uh where did I do
Fountain where did I uh where did I do
this oops
map data Json yeah here
well that's a lot of Tower
data literally has their help and
data literally has their help and
stuff h
what is a fort there's Fort and

for different reasons but also there's

just like a ton of infrastructure and
just like a ton of infrastructure and
Engineering around you know getting
Engineering around you know getting
stuff to play nice with simulators um
stuff to play nice with simulators um
and in research we like to have really
and in research we like to have really
high performance simulators so that we
high performance simulators so that we
can you know iterate on a bunch of
can you know iterate on a bunch of
experiments fast and develop new methods
experiments fast and develop new methods
and such such that when we go have to
and such such that when we go have to
deal with a a slower simulator you know
deal with a a slower simulator you know
we kind of understand how everything
we kind of understand how everything
works and we can make progress there
works and we can make progress there
much more quickly without having to run
much more quickly without having to run
as many experiments on the slow
as many experiments on the slow

[Music]
so we'll start with just the towers I
so we'll start with just the towers I
guess we'll do
does it have a
does it have a

NPC DOTA
NPC DOTA
Tower okay so the learning aspect of RL
Tower okay so the learning aspect of RL
is partly a blat box not
is partly a blat box not
really same as other areas of deep
really same as other areas of deep
learning algorithms are slightly
learning algorithms are slightly
different but it's all like back
different but it's all like back
propagation based
here's the learning
code
code
so here is data we've already collected
so here is data we've already collected
from the environment previously we go
from the environment previously we go
back and forth between collecting data
back and forth between collecting data
and training on
and training on
it um so here we're running the
it um so here we're running the
network this is where we have you know
network this is where we have you know
some losses that we calculate as you
some losses that we calculate as you
would in supervised
would in supervised
learning there are a few more losses
learning there are a few more losses
than normal normal an RL but nothing big
than normal normal an RL but nothing big
and here's your normal lost backwards
and here's your normal lost backwards
zero
zero
grad same as the rest of deep learning
I think all we have to do
is we get rid of this
right why do people say the hidden layer
right why do people say the hidden layer
in neural Nets are Black

um generally people who know what
um generally people who know what
they're talking about don't say that
they're talking about don't say that
um that's like kind of an old
um that's like kind of an old
perspective on stuff or like a naive
perspective on stuff or like a naive
perspective like yeah you can't ask it
perspective like yeah you can't ask it
to explain its reasoning but that
to explain its reasoning but that
doesn't mean that we don't have tools
doesn't mean that we don't have tools
for understanding you know how these
for understanding you know how these
things are learning at least
partially that that interpretation was
partially that that interpretation was
like popular in maybe like 2016 or
like popular in maybe like 2016 or
whatever
whatever
but things have gotten a bit
better we also we have lots of ways to
better we also we have lots of ways to
visualize how decisions are taken
visualize how decisions are taken
especially in reinforcement learning it
especially in reinforcement learning it
just it takes a little bit of work as
just it takes a little bit of work as
well because your network doesn't speak
English this run
well yeah it's a easier to keep up when
well yeah it's a easier to keep up when
it's your full-time job right really way
it's your full-time job right really way
more than my full-time
more than my full-time
job must be

[Music]
integers what did I do oh this
integers what did I do oh this
is it or sub dick
wait
why does it do origin like this this is
why does it do origin like this this is
so
so
gross um it should know to just
like
there I mean yeah this
there I mean yeah this
is I actually don't even keep up all
is I actually don't even keep up all
that well with recent literature
that well with recent literature
um I keep up obviously with like major
um I keep up obviously with like major
advancements in
advancements in
RL um but yeah this is definitely this
RL um but yeah this is definitely this
is what I do like all the
is what I do like all the
time substantially more than a full-time
time substantially more than a full-time
job
really okay so we've got the
really okay so we've got the
camps perfect so we've got all the
camps perfect so we've got all the
towers
and all the
and all the
camps we've got a little naming
convention and these positions all look
convention and these positions all look
good as
well we have this copy function
somewhere
somewhere
yeah
yeah
uh data do
gaml and now what we're going to do is
gaml and now what we're going to do is
we're going to load in
entity
entity
data or was it entity data
path data do
yl
yl
yaml okay so now we've got this entity
yaml okay so now we've got this entity
data which is very nice
and this is a dictionary but we can
and this is a dictionary but we can
still just pass this to
still just pass this to
syon because it's only going to be used
syon because it's only going to be used
on uh reset I
on uh reset I
believe so this is perfectly fine we got
believe so this is perfectly fine we got
entity

fact we're going to do this will be
fact we're going to do this will be
self. entity data
HS
data this is is dict
data this is is dict
entity like
this and we can just add this as a dict
this and we can just add this as a dict

first but
first but
uh yeah
so something weird is happening with
so something weird is happening with
these towers huh
these towers huh
because tower
Tower is it a different coordinate
system oh it might be a different
system oh it might be a different
coordinate system I might just
be 0 0 is the
be 0 0 is the
center uh and the other one is bottom
center uh and the other one is bottom
left corner the map I
left corner the map I
believe so I'm using the top left corner
believe so I'm using the top left corner
of the map how would that change
things I've been coding in Python for a
things I've been coding in Python for a
few
few
months very good oh welcome
pretty confused with what's wrong
here let me go look at the DOTA
map yeah this is what I thought it was
map yeah this is what I thought it was
right so you've got
one two three it's very simle simple
right good
right good
afternoon we loaded up uh the DOTA
afternoon we loaded up uh the DOTA
map I'm trying to get the towers placed
map I'm trying to get the towers placed
correctly loading uh the positions from
correctly loading uh the positions from
the game
files I think I have one of the
files I think I have one of the
transforms wrong or something so the mid
transforms wrong or something so the mid
Towers look like they are
Towers look like they are
correct but then why are there
no wait one two
no wait one two
three why the other Towers is not in the
three why the other Towers is not in the
right
spot actually these mid ones are maybe
spot actually these mid ones are maybe
like they're maybe offset a little bit
like they're maybe offset a little bit
but they're not bad
right maybe I just should open up the
right maybe I just should open up the
file and see if the positions I
file and see if the positions I
calculated look
calculated look
reasonable
uh
uh
so bad guys bot
so bad guys bot
one this y chord is too small
so I think I have to flip
it does this make any sense if I flip it
poer
poer
lib poer
lib
lib
MOA
neutrals okay
I forgot to
okay how did you extract that map data
okay how did you extract that map data
yeah there's I found there's a
yeah there's I found there's a
repo no it's not simple
repo no it's not simple
um somebody there's like this random
um somebody there's like this random
repo devil SK
repo devil SK
okay they've
got some very old
got some very old
scripts um from like 7 point
scripts um from like 7 point
something
something
but they also have the extracted game
but they also have the extracted game
files already in it so I can just use
files already in it so I can just use
those game files and just fix up their
those game files and just fix up their
scripts a little
bit but I am not entirely sure
bit but I am not entirely sure
how stuff is um how stuff is being
oriented like I think this has to be
that
right is the map actually
right is the map actually
nonsquare so apparently it's nonsquare
nonsquare so apparently it's nonsquare
but I couldn't
but I couldn't
tell okay what is going wrong here like
tell okay what is going wrong here like
here I'll screenshot it
again
so the mid Towers look reasonable
right and
then Towers over here
are they just
are they just
shifted what's at the top left I I'm
shifted what's at the top left I I'm
spawning stuff wrong which is what's
spawning stuff wrong which is what's
crashing the game um that's why I
crashing the game um that's why I
screenshotted it so that we could see
screenshotted it so that we could see
it
it
um wait actually one two these are in a
um wait actually one two these are in a
line here right these towers are in a
line is
line is
this these look like they're this looks
this these look like they're this looks
like these are supposed to be the top
like these are supposed to be the top
towers and they're just
towers and they're just
shifted
maybe and then this one here looks like
maybe and then this one here looks like
it got moved because this should be down
here so I could have just scaled stuff
here so I could have just scaled stuff
wrong right
looks very possible that I just scaled
looks very possible that I just scaled
stuff
stuff
wrong so what's the correct
scaling what if you give them different
scaling what if you give them different
colors PL on the placement order
colors PL on the placement order
make some guesses as how did they got
make some guesses as how did they got
transformed
transformed
wrong
yeah um let me think how to do
yeah um let me think how to do
that it's kind of annoying to do that in
that it's kind of annoying to do that in
the current because it's like the towers
the current because it's like the towers
are being placed in
are being placed in
scyon hold
scyon hold
on I I just want to look up one thing
on I I just want to look up one thing
first which is the transformation I got
first which is the transformation I got
I got the numbers from this random
site coordinate
system coordinate grid
system coordinate grid
is XYZ
crazy idea why I bother
crazy idea why I bother
extracting overlaying the images and
extracting overlaying the images and
eyeballing
eyeballing
it
it
so it's because I have to figure this
so it's because I have to figure this
out anyways because I also have to do
out anyways because I also have to do
the neutral
the neutral
camps and those are going to be
camps and those are going to be
substantially more
painful so it's kind of worth just
painful so it's kind of worth just
figuring out the
transformation but yeah that's why and
transformation but yeah that's why and
like if I want to add stuff in the
like if I want to add stuff in the
future as well like it's I figured it
future as well like it's I figured it
would be the easiest thing is going to
would be the easiest thing is going to
be to just have a yaml file that has all
be to just have a yaml file that has all
of the game data in
of the game data in
it so if I want to add like a bounty
it so if I want to add like a bounty
Rune I can add a bounty
Rune this also makes it one to one with
Rune this also makes it one to one with
DOTA
DOTA
which I mean unless valve decides that
which I mean unless valve decides that
they hate this project which I doubt
they hate this project which I doubt
given that they went with the open ai5
given that they went with the open ai5
thing right
I think this is going to be pretty nice
let's see what the coordinates say so it
let's see what the coordinates say so it
says the bottom Tower
is according to
is according to
this bottom Tower is at
this bottom Tower is at
78 what about manually ballp parking one
78 what about manually ballp parking one
or two towers and comparing them to the
or two towers and comparing them to the
that's what I'm doing right now
yeah that's what I'm doing right
yeah that's what I'm doing right
now so we
now so we
have
11478 so we have actually several that
11478 so we have actually several that
are on like right around 114
are on like right around 114
here so these should be all in a
line which I guess are
line which I guess are
these right there's one here there's one
these right there's one here there's one
there there's one there
actually if you look at
actually if you look at
this hold on look right
this hold on look right
here right here
here these look like they're just
here these look like they're just
shifted
right how long does it take the game to
right how long does it take the game to
crash not very
long I mean the ball parking is it's
long I mean the ball parking is it's
very close right these are the 113s look
very close right these are the 113s look
I have right here I've got three towers
I have right here I've got three towers
that are at on this line these are the
that are at on this line these are the
three towers that are in a line right
here which one has like a really big x
here which one has like a really big x
coordinate on this
I'm not seeing anything that has a
I'm not seeing anything that has a
coordinate that would go to right here
right oh did I for wait how many Towers
right oh did I for wait how many Towers
am I spawning it looks like they're too
am I spawning it looks like they're too
many right did I just forget to comment
many right did I just forget to comment
out the spawn code on the other
out the spawn code on the other
on that might have been
it does this only have wait does this
it does this only have wait does this
have only game data Towers or does it
have only game data Towers or does it
still have the
still have the
ones yeah that's what I was just yeah
ones yeah that's what I was just yeah
checking there's a little bit of a delay
checking there's a little bit of a delay
on the stream I wish I could make the
on the stream I wish I could make the
delay shorter I think there's like a 15
delay shorter I think there's like a 15
I don't know how long we could time
it well this is
it well this is
commented but wait maybe when it
commented but wait maybe when it
respawns maybe like there's
still on
Tower oh wait what's
Tower oh wait what's
this yeah in the reset right here right
I had it put
I had it put
twice okay so let's this will be cleaner
now and then I think it's just a scaling
now and then I think it's just a scaling
issue from
here 8 to 10 second
here 8 to 10 second
delay isn't that just about right for
delay isn't that just about right for
YouTube I didn't know I thought YouTube
YouTube I didn't know I thought YouTube
always has a bit of the delay I thought
always has a bit of the delay I thought
twitch is the one that's
twitch is the one that's
usually uh like really low latency I
usually uh like really low latency I
could change it in my settings maybe if
could change it in my settings maybe if
there's a an
option boom
twitch is really low
twitch is really low
yeah there's still way too many Towers
yeah there's still way too many Towers
in here aren't
there oh wait the the towers are
there oh wait the the towers are
flipped
right yeah yeah yeah the towers are
right yeah yeah yeah the towers are
flipped mid towers are going across the
flipped mid towers are going across the
river okay so we just got to fix the
river okay so we just got to fix the
trans form and fix the
transform I'm going to be
fun would that happen if I flipped the
fun would that happen if I flipped the
Y yeah that would happen if I flipped
Y yeah that would happen if I flipped
the Y
right let's try this
huh is it still
flipped why is it still
flipped plus 130 one
flipped plus 130 one
over two
right uh
right uh
[Music]
[Music]
process
process
yaml so let's see the mid
Towers maybe X and y are
swapped could be X and Y are
swapped I think that their coordinate is
swapped I think that their coordinate is
starting from the
bottom I'm surprised that it didn't the
bottom I'm surprised that it didn't the
thing that I just did didn't fix
it cuz okay first of all this is
it cuz okay first of all this is
definitely wrong right right uh the
definitely wrong right right uh the
bottom one Tower one for the bottom is
bottom one Tower one for the bottom is
not at y
not at y
51.7 so I think we definitely have to
51.7 so I think we definitely have to
flip the y-coordinate
right because the DOTA coordinate system
right because the DOTA coordinate system
is uh bottom left is 0
is uh bottom left is 0
0 so I think we have to flip that
0 so I think we have to flip that
coordinate so let's uh let's redo that
coordinate so let's uh let's redo that
okay and now
bad guys Tower to Mid
bad guys Tower to Mid
is that looks like where the tower to
is that looks like where the tower to
the mid Tower too should be bad guys
the mid Tower too should be bad guys
Tower one
mid that looks correct to

mid that looks correct to
mid that looks correct to

y

yeah okay so let's now make sure this is
yeah okay so let's now make sure this is
getting to neutrals.
yaml ah data.
yls yes my number my number system is
yls yes my number my number system is
top left it's just row column uh format
top left it's just row column uh format
so that you don't have to do extra
math perfect I think we got it
now these are offset a little bit wrong
now these are offset a little bit wrong
right like one
right like one
two tier one tier two tier
three the offsets are a little wonky but
three the offsets are a little wonky but
it's very
close right
like this one especially these like this
like this one especially these like this
line of towers here
line of towers here
is is off just a little
bit so close
though let's take a look at the
though let's take a look at the
uh the DOTA M I haven't checked this in
uh the DOTA M I haven't checked this in
a while
a while
for
for
comparison so this one is supposed to
comparison so this one is supposed to
be this is the bridge it's supposed to
be this is the bridge it's supposed to
be like here it's just a little bit
be like here it's just a little bit
off this one is supposed to
off this one is supposed to
be like right here and this one so so
be like right here and this one so so
it's just a little bit
off well our mid and bottom actually
off well our mid and bottom actually
correct
yeah this is pretty much spot
on this one is not right isn't it unless
on this one is not right isn't it unless
the map is changed isn't this Tower
the map is changed isn't this Tower
supposed to be back
here and this one's supposed to be back
here and this one's supposed to be back
this
this
way mid lane in your black and blue
way mid lane in your black and blue
looks really wide
looks really wide
um well that's just cuz trees aren't
um well that's just cuz trees aren't
being drawn
right so if you look here right you have
right so if you look here right you have
this as an obstacle there's a wall here
this as an obstacle there's a wall here
but then all this is
trees so if you don't draw the trees
in yeah I could draw the trees in by the
in yeah I could draw the trees in by the
way that's like a thing we could
way that's like a thing we could
potentially do um I just don't don't
know I don't know if I want to be
know I don't know if I want to be
implementing Vision cover like that
implementing Vision cover like that
Vision cover is kind of
hard we'll see this is a cool project
though let's just Implement a MOA from
though let's just Implement a MOA from
scratch why
not so I think this is something with
not so I think this is something with
our scaling right
in that case they all look shifted to
in that case they all look shifted to
the right eight or so
squares eight or so
squares well this isn't eight or so
squares well this isn't eight or so
squares right the the ones on the right
squares right the the ones on the right
don't seem shifted that much
this lines
up tier one Tower bottom
up tier one Tower bottom
left well yeah these are
left well yeah these are
shifted and the this is shift like these
shifted and the this is shift like these
could be shifted but like why over here
could be shifted but like why over here
do these look
do these look
good right
I mean my transform could be
I mean my transform could be
wrong here let's look at the transform I
wrong here let's look at the transform I
did and I'll try to explain maybe you
did and I'll try to explain maybe you
can catch a bug on this for me that'd be
can catch a bug on this for me that'd be
nice um I think it's just the transform
nice um I think it's just the transform
right
right
so what I did here is um they give you
so what I did here is um they give you
coordinates that are from the center so
coordinates that are from the center so
their coordinate system that they're
their coordinate system that they're
using for this is
using for this is
uh it's like a 2d centered coordinate
uh it's like a 2d centered coordinate
system so up is positive right is
system so up is positive right is
positive but it's Center is 0
positive but it's Center is 0
so uh I computed the scaling
so uh I computed the scaling
factor with uh as
factor with uh as
138 and then
138 and then
130 though it's a little odd because it
130 though it's a little odd because it
is a square map um so I'm not sure I
is a square map um so I'm not sure I
have that perfectly
correct and then I flip the
Y the spacing on the Y turrets
Y the spacing on the Y turrets
correct that's another thing we can
check this one's about
check this one's about
right could the 130 and 138 be swapped
right could the 130 and 138 be swapped
138 it the map is supposed to be wider
138 it the map is supposed to be wider
than it is tall
but the thing is like the PNG that I get
but the thing is like the PNG that I get
of the map is actually
of the map is actually
Square
Square
so I could maybe make the I could make
so I could maybe make the I could make
them both
138 or both
130 well let me think so the
130 well let me think so the
the map is 200 and we should be able to
the map is 200 and we should be able to
compute this actually because hold
on DOTA to Map
size approximately 11,000 by 11,000
size approximately 11,000 by 11,000
what's it exactly
this doesn't say 11,000 by 11,000 this
this doesn't say 11,000 by 11,000 this
says 17 Whatever by
says 17 Whatever by
1600 which is not quite a square I have
1600 which is not quite a square I have
no idea where they're counting from
though so what factor do we get from
though so what factor do we get from
this
664 wait
664 wait
17 divided by 260 is the size of the
17 divided by 260 is the size of the
PNG gives a 67 scaling
PNG gives a 67 scaling
Factor
um but but then what I wanted to do is I
um but but then what I wanted to do is I
wanted to make it to size 128 right so
wanted to make it to size 128 right so
this is how I computed it I did like
this is how I computed it I did like
this and I got the
this and I got the
138 and then I did
138 and then I did
16643 and I got
130 well this website could just be
130 well this website could just be
wrong right
they could both be
they could both be
130 that would give you a shift of about
130 that would give you a shift of about
eight cells wouldn't
eight cells wouldn't
it and then the 130 would squish it let
it and then the 130 would squish it let
me try 130 for
me try 130 for
both I bet you that fixes it I bet the
both I bet you that fixes it I bet the
website's just wrong
X scaler to one yeah
X scaler to one yeah
that's pretty funny how we both get this
that's pretty funny how we both get this
at like the exact same
time okay
see this even
see this even
worse or is this the same
I think these are the same I don't know
I think these are the same I don't know
if this actually got applied
how is it the
how is it the
same that doesn't make sense to
me oh I didn't do it in the I did it in
me oh I didn't do it in the I did it in
the wrong
the wrong
spot I did it in the wrong spot I did it
spot I did it in the wrong spot I did it
to the new I Didn't Do It To The
Towers God so
careless all right here we go boom fixed
careless all right here we go boom fixed
we win we win
we win we win
DOTA we win the
game
game
boom perfect
here you go here's your map the map is
here you go here's your map the map is
good
I
Y has anybody ever noticed that uh this
Y has anybody ever noticed that uh this
is actually the perfect game for puffer
is actually the perfect game for puffer
fish because the map already has a fish
fish because the map already has a fish
on it right here's the eye here's like
on it right here's the eye here's like
the mouth here it's got two fins right
the mouth here it's got two fins right
it's already already got a fish it's got
it's already already got a fish it's got
a
tail literally the perfect game for a
tail literally the perfect game for a
puffer
fish DOTA
fish the puffer Moa
fish the puffer Moa
I guess we get to do neutral creeps now
huh logo basically draws
huh logo basically draws
itself were you around for the
itself were you around for the
continuous control
continuous control
environment I have an environment where
environment I have an environment where
the objective of the agents you have you
the objective of the agents you have you
control a bunch of particle agents and
control a bunch of particle agents and
the goal is for them to fill in the
the goal is for them to fill in the
puffer lib
logo so you get like 4,000 agents that
logo so you get like 4,000 agents that
have to draw out puffer lib
I don't think I got a gift of that one
I don't think I got a gift of that one
that one's actually kind of hard to
that one's actually kind of hard to
solve but
uh have anything cool
here oh yeah we have like environments
here oh yeah we have like environments
like this right like continuous control
like this right like continuous control
like Point environments like this
like Point environments like this
come back to these in a bit but you know
come back to these in a bit but you know
they're fun they also run like well over
they're fun they also run like well over
10 million steps per second so that's
nice okay
nice okay
uh
highx so what we're going to do now is
highx so what we're going to do now is
we're going to do spawn neutrals
and we have to go make neutral
spawns float array neutral
spawns the four
how many neutrals are
there neutral Camp good so this is four
there neutral Camp good so this is four
plus 4
plus 4
8 six uh wait 8 12
8 six uh wait 8 12
20 uh
20 uh
36 36 * 2 72
36 36 * 2 72
neutrals total creeps there are
neutrals total creeps there are
72 creeps
nice so what we're going to do is we're
nice so what we're going to do is we're
just going to do
just going to do
prefix neutral
Camp uh so four team in range of
Camp uh so four team in range of
two and actually we can uh
or team in range two uh if
or team in range two uh if
team prefix
equals uh was is
it neutral Camp
good neutral Camp bad
in
in
range
range
110 come on go full Dynamic and make a
110 come on go full Dynamic and make a
team name array uh this is getting
team name array uh this is getting
stored in a numpy array we're not going
stored in a numpy array we're not going
to do any string processing so once this
to do any string processing so once this
gets it's actually going to get stored
gets it's actually going to get stored
in a m map so this will be stored in a c
in a m map so this will be stored in a c
native data structure so this is slow
native data structure so this is slow
but this doesn't matter this is just on
but this doesn't matter this is just on
a knit
oh
prefix yep and then what we do
is ID x equal
z
z
e
e
five or neutral
entity data of neutral
name
name
neutral I meant so you don't have the
neutral I meant so you don't have the
branching for team name oh yeah yeah
branching for team name oh yeah yeah
yeah we'll clean this up this is this is
yeah we'll clean this up this is this is
a garbage code I'm well aware this is Le
a garbage code I'm well aware this is Le
garbage code Le garbage code complete
garbage code Le garbage code complete
Mee
complet a garbage
code
oops I'm under no Illusions
there okay so
there okay so
spawn neutral
spawn neutral
what's the Sig on this it's just
idx uh we don't need spawn neutral we
idx uh we don't need spawn neutral we
actually just want was it neutral
actually just want was it neutral
pause neutral
spawns
so s
so s
do numpy do zer
do numpy do zer
neutrals
neutrals
2 and then what we do is self.
2 and then what we do is self.
neutral
spawns Y and X we set y and
x and we have entity
neutral don't know if we have anything
neutral don't know if we have anything
to render these guys yet but let's
see neutral Camp bad one
neutral
neutral
Camp oh it's evil not
bad that's so funny how they named it
bad that's so funny how they named it
like they didn't name it radiant and
like they didn't name it radiant and
dire like internally it's just dieser
dire like internally it's just dieser
the bad guys dieser the good guys that's
the bad guys dieser the good guys that's
how you make the video
game okay well this was something it
game okay well this was something it
just didn't it just crashed really fast
just didn't it just crashed really fast
I'm going to try to catch
I'm going to try to catch
it I caught it hold on
okay so it's not actually drawing
them it's not
consistent yeah that's
consistent yeah that's
funny
uh hold on I need to figure
out okay one second
okay we're good
um let me see
so I'm trying to remember where I was
so I'm trying to remember where I was
drawing stuff
drawing stuff
here
the it should be here
right asset map of
right asset map of
tile and then asset map
gets okay so here's the asset
gets okay so here's the asset
map and when you move a neutral what
happens hold on
uh so right
here agent type is neutral
and then you set it to agent
and then you set it to agent
type wait which
is seven so we need to add a color for
is seven so we need to add a color for
neutrals I
neutrals I
believe let's rebuild in the mean
time I don't know why I have all these
time I don't know why I have all these
snake comments
are we even using
are we even using
these no we're not even using these are
these no we're not even using these are
we oh we're using them there
potentially okay well we'll just make uh
potentially okay well we'll just make uh
we'll make it green
okay so this is
okay so this is
is it runs now but I'm not seeing the
is it runs now but I'm not seeing the
neutrals not seeing the neutrals
yet one two three four six s
oops log when it's rendering that's what
oops log when it's rendering that's what
I'm trying to
do oh wait this is not going here
this is the wrong one it because there's
this is the wrong one it because there's
the the other renderer but it should
the the other renderer but it should
still have colors I defined colors for
still have colors I defined colors for
it
it
already uh though it looks like this
already uh though it looks like this
asset map will need to be updated so we
asset map will need to be updated so we
can do
seven no wait this doesn't need to be
seven no wait this doesn't need to be
updated that's dumb
um where's a render
um where's a render
function yeah right here
function yeah right here
so we can just put a break point in here
me
me
grid 0 one two 3 and
four okay so now we have 0o through six
four okay so now we have 0o through six
but no
sevens why does it take so long to
sevens why does it take so long to
build uh well that was the run time and
build uh well that was the run time and
it didn't take so long to build it the
it didn't take so long to build it the
screen just didn't Refresh on my uh
screen just didn't Refresh on my uh
breakpoint so I had to press enter so it
breakpoint so I had to press enter so it
would show the break point that's
all syon does take a quick uh scon takes
all syon does take a quick uh scon takes
a hot second
a hot second
to to build though for
to to build though for
sure spawn
sure spawn
neutral entity type is assigned entity
neutral entity type is assigned entity
neutral is assigned
neutral is assigned
spawn and we forgot to call reset so
spawn and we forgot to call reset so
that would probably do it
so this is how long scon takes to build
so this is how long scon takes to build
uh I'm not compiling multi- thread
uh I'm not compiling multi- thread
because when you compile multi-thread it
because when you compile multi-thread it
screws up your error messages I
screws up your error messages I
found this less than 10
seconds really it would be nice if it
seconds really it would be nice if it
were instant but
well this looks like it's infinitely
well this looks like it's infinitely
looping to
looping to
me
right yeah it's definitely infinitely
looping oh it's
looping oh it's
slow I mean you're a project this size
slow I mean you're a project this size
should be compiling in a quarter of a
should be compiling in a quarter of a
second at most
really it should be compiling too fast
really it should be compiling too fast
for you to
notice that would be the
ideal but the thing is okay a file this
ideal but the thing is okay a file this

did pre-compile like that in the

if we go to 5,000 we're defining tons of

looks like the source code of a

yeah
look if somebody wanted to just like
look if somebody wanted to just like
really make good tooling around this it
really make good tooling around this it
would be awesome but

like like the only thing with good good
like like the only thing with good good

Zig and neither of those help me right
so so this is kind of the best thing out
so so this is kind of the best thing out
there for what I'm
there for what I'm
doing not even kind of it is the best
doing not even kind of it is the best
thing out there by a massive massive
thing out there by a massive massive
margin uh so let's see
margin uh so let's see
why apparently the spawns are like
why apparently the spawns are like
slightly off or
something what if I just do
something what if I just do
this we'll see where it's like it's
this we'll see where it's like it's
failing
cuz I think we're just slightly off
maybe doesn't even
render really
hd.
type
break and good documentation yeah
break and good documentation yeah
well I mean honestly how often do you
well I mean honestly how often do you
use the docs of a language
well this is just like spawning tons of
well this is just like spawning tons of
things it looks like
things it looks like
right it just like spawned them all
right it just like spawned them all
here I
here I
guess so I'm
guess so I'm
assuming ah right here this respawn
assuming ah right here this respawn
function
wait did you get my message
wait did you get my message
about a background
in.net no I think YouTube ate the
comment I did not get that
comment I did not get that
one okay so this function is not
one okay so this function is not
designed
designed
for uh this function is not designed for
for uh this function is not designed for
neutrals it looks like
neutrals it looks like
so we can just get rid of this get rid
so we can just get rid of this get rid
of
this and the only thing we really need
this and the only thing we really need
here
is oops
Health oh we're
good neutral Max Mana
zero
aoom oh we forgot uh we killed the
aoom oh we forgot uh we killed the
respawn function as
well I don't have link filtering or
well I don't have link filtering or
anything enabled so it must be the
anything enabled so it must be the
YouTube link filter I know twitch lets
YouTube link filter I know twitch lets
you post links by default
you post links by default
um but yeah that's weird
well this thing right here looks like a
neutral but it should be there should be
neutral but it should be there should be
green so I don't know what this is doing
green so I don't know what this is doing
here
print and we'll have to
print and we'll have to
um potentially we can even just use
um potentially we can even just use
dota's creep way points I assume it has
dota's creep way points I assume it has
some
right I just move to next
right I just move to next
Waypoint uh okay so right here it's not
Waypoint uh okay so right here it's not
actually these positions did not get
actually these positions did not get
updated so
updated so
neutral
spawns self. neutral
spawns self. neutral
spawns we forgot to increment idx here
spawns we forgot to increment idx here
that'll do
it it's going to be real cool when this
it it's going to be real cool when this
is uh when we have the neutrals
in oh yeah there we
in oh yeah there we
go boom
look at
that is that where the neutrals are
that is that where the neutrals are
supposed to
be they look pretty far apart from each
other aren't these supposed to be like
other aren't these supposed to be like
clusters of of neutrals that are pretty
clusters of of neutrals that are pretty
close or is this how they are
well here's a map that has where the
well here's a map that has where the
camps are
kind of odd
right so
this is actually pretty good this is
this is actually pretty good this is
what we
what we
want
um so like this one
there there ones up top that aren't
there there ones up top that aren't
being caught at all right small neutral
being caught at all right small neutral
camps how many are
camps how many are
there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
14 so this according to the thing that I
14 so this according to the thing that I
have it only has 10 neutral
have it only has 10 neutral
camps
camps
um fact it only gives me one through
um fact it only gives me one through
nine so I think it gives me nine neutral
nine so I think it gives me nine neutral
camps so could just be doing
the medium and larges or
the medium and larges or
something but in that case I should
something but in that case I should
still have a neutral camp like up here
still have a neutral camp like up here
up
up
here so it doesn't look like the
here so it doesn't look like the
positions are
positions are
correct let's see how we are recording
correct let's see how we are recording
the
positions I'm doing y comma X right
dot dot
dot dot
slash
DOTA so in process neutrals we
DOTA so in process neutrals we
have well this is wrong right here so
have well this is wrong right here so
this should be
this should be
minus right so y-coordinate is
minus right so y-coordinate is
definitely wrong this is 130 over
definitely wrong this is 130 over
two minus
this I don't think that's going to fix
this I don't think that's going to fix
it on its
it on its
own but we will run
this process neutrals
where's that move command
so that actually does improve
so that actually does improve
it I
think no not this one
so this
so this
Camp is like
Camp is like
here there's a camp here which has stuff
here there's a camp here which has stuff
in it I'm not getting the camps up
top why are they in this color also they
top why are they in this color also they
shouldn't be in this
color I making it hard to tell them
color I making it hard to tell them
apart from other stuff
entity
neutral agent type equal
neutral neutral is
seven wait hold on
0 1 2 3 four five six
so
yeah okay well that's a little better at
yeah okay well that's a little better at
least
least
now we can tell for sure that we are
now we can tell for sure that we are
drawing
neutrals so here here's the
map clear some missing location data
map clear some missing location data
yeah but like why are they spread out
yeah but like why are they spread out
this
this
far
right like this Camp right
here why are it spawn spread out this
here why are it spawn spread out this
far these don't look to
me not a DOTA play do they have slightly
me not a DOTA play do they have slightly
random spawn
random spawn
locations oh this could be the box
locations oh this could be the box
maybe these could be the the spawn this
maybe these could be the the spawn this
could be a spawn box you're right right
could be a spawn box you're right right
because it uh it listed like one two
because it uh it listed like one two
three four in the data so these could
three four in the data so these could
very well be the spawn
boxes so let's think of it that way if
boxes so let's think of it that way if
these are the spawn boxes and obviously
these are the spawn boxes and obviously
it didn't draw the corners that are over
it didn't draw the corners that are over
you know another thing
yeah they're all perfect rectangles
um are they in the right locations
though I can't tell if they're quite
though I can't tell if they're quite
right or not actually where did our
right or not actually where did our
Towers
Towers
go aren't we supposed to have Tower
go aren't we supposed to have Tower
data where did where did the other
data where did where did the other
Towers
go I don't see them anymore
the
heck we call that a regression
yeah I didn't change the SP the tower
yeah I didn't change the SP the tower
code did I
on right
spawn
spawn
Tower was it really that bad is that
Tower was it really that bad is that
what really what
what really what
happened yeah the towers are not
there towers are just not
there what if I do this
nice looks very DOTA welcome iron
bound iron from the uh the Pokemon Red
Discord long time no see
okay so when I don't spawn the
okay so when I don't spawn the
neutrals it works so I assume that I'm
neutrals it works so I assume that I'm
overwriting the ideas somehow
overwriting the ideas somehow
right yeah I've got to just be
right yeah I've got to just be
overwriting the the
overwriting the the
IDS so num
neutrals agents creeps neutrals Towers
neutrals agents creeps neutrals Towers
is how I have this specified
agent creeps
numb agents creeps neutrals Towers yep
wait 9 * 4 is
wait 9 * 4 is
36 m 2 is 72 no my math is
right what's
right what's
this in PID is idx plus num
this in PID is idx plus num
agents num Towers num creeps this is a
agents num Towers num creeps this is a
spine
okay I'm going to be right back
uh I will be right
uh I will be right
back and then we're going to fix this
back and then we're going to fix this
and we'll change it so that it spawns in
and we'll change it so that it spawns in
spawn boxes instead of spawning in a
spawn boxes instead of spawning in a
specific
spot
e
e e
okay let's uh let us figure out what is
okay let's uh let us figure out what is
wrong with this now
um so these neutral spawns first of all
um so these neutral spawns first of all
are just not
are just not
correct um
are these boxes different sizes or can I
are these boxes different sizes or can I
just like do a A plus minus
just like do a A plus minus
thing they are slightly different
thing they are slightly different
sizes but I think I could also just do
sizes but I think I could also just do
like a plus minus thing
right I was going to pick the center and
right I was going to pick the center and
then I was going to just randomly spawn
then I was going to just randomly spawn
the agents uh nearby like within like a
the agents uh nearby like within like a
three
three
radius or two radius or something like
radius or two radius or something like
that
I could do that
I could do that
right
no that'll be simpler as
no that'll be simpler as
well so let's uh let us do that
not all of those are boxes I don't think
not all of those are boxes I don't think
they're all boxes aren't they which one
they're all boxes aren't they which one
isn't a
box top
box top
left well this one it it didn't fill in
left well this one it it didn't fill in
this corner cuz this corner was a wall
this corner cuz this corner was a wall
right and then like presumably this one
right and then like presumably this one
yeah you can see the bottom corner here
yeah you can see the bottom corner here
so it didn't fill in this top Corner
so it didn't fill in this top Corner
because it overlaps this pixel
so there are a few of them like that
so there are a few of them like that
like this one is also a box it's just
like this one is also a box it's just
this pixel
this pixel
here so I think that they're all boxes
here so I think that they're all boxes
I'm pretty
sure
sure
[Music]
[Music]
mhm
so okay so now we have
so okay so now we have
subdi gives you
subdi gives you
camp and then and now what we can do is
camp and then and now what we can do is
we can just do
we can just do
top left
equals uh
subdi
One X subject to one
X bottom
X bottom
right this is
right this is
four I'm imagining it's going to be four
four I'm imagining it's going to be four
right we can check it and then what we
right we can check it and then what we
do is Camp data
this
x what the
heck
um top left
and we also have
and we also have
to Norm these right so it's this
to Norm these right so it's this
[Music]
over this one
is like this right 13 over2
minus okay
so this is now top
so this is now top
X
plus
plus
this
this
yeah that looks good to me
now we get Center
points should that be y before
X
where uh it's a dictionary so dictionary
where uh it's a dictionary so dictionary
is order invariant it's access by Keys
is order invariant it's access by Keys
it's a hash
map yeah
I forget that not everybody devs in
Python I don't know python gets a lot of
Python I don't know python gets a lot of
hate I really like
python hate the performance but hey
python hate the performance but hey
that's uh sithon is pretty
nice to be fair though I like python
nice to be fair though I like python
without numpy substantially less
fintech they don't let you do Python and
fintech they don't let you do Python and
fintech
ah they ought
to my types
to my types
though but my types
I think this is actually got to be 18
I think this is actually got to be 18
camps
camps
right um camps
what's your favorite video
what's your favorite video

old school
RuneScape that game is so incredibly
RuneScape that game is so incredibly
addictive to me that I have to ban
addictive to me that I have to ban
myself from playing it all summer that I
myself from playing it all summer that I
can do work
neutral
spawns neutral in range 1 through
five so this will just be like four
five so this will just be like four
neutrals per Camp
right entity
right entity
data of neutral name
of
of
Y don't need this
anymore there 18 camps
right 99 wood cutting on use I actually
right 99 wood cutting on use I actually
didn't play it when I was younger but
didn't play it when I was younger but
um I'm sure I don't have any screenshots
um I'm sure I don't have any screenshots
around do
I
I
uh hold on
uh hold on
actually I totally do on this machine
actually I totally do on this machine
don't
I one
second the heck do they put
I don't know if these have audio or if
I don't know if these have audio or if
they're
muted
muted
no well whatever I was trying to find
no well whatever I was trying to find
some cool Clips
some cool Clips
but I played a lot of that game
I don't know Inferno cap and Master's
I don't know Inferno cap and Master's
Helm if that means anything these
days spawn neutral
so what we're going to do is
I don't know where it's getting this
I don't know where it's getting this
Rand int thing
from y
wait seven so
wait seven so
three yeah
I think this does it
right e
out of
bounds
bounds
oh yeah this doesn't give you you need
oh yeah this doesn't give you you need
group as
group as
well
well
group we in Camp I
think what's camp
no that doesn't work
there something like
this e
really
really
weird move
two possibly these are getting set to
two possibly these are getting set to
zero still
where the heck is
it why is there all this scon spam as
well oh 4,000 something no that's

weird
weird
um no that looks correct uh but why
um no that looks correct uh but why
would it be that value did I mess up the

solid look at
solid look at
that we got neutrals
here they Jitter
around now the question is are these
around now the question is are these
camps
accurate and the neutrals are going to
accurate and the neutrals are going to
fight the creep that's
funny we can always see if they're
funny we can always see if they're
accurate
after we just leave it it's a

no for
Target I think we need to set their team
Target I think we need to set their team
to something different
to something different
right team
right team
two let's just set them to team
two let's just set them to team
two and then what we'll do
is
is
Target um
Target um
uh if target.
uh if target.
type equals
it's
awkward whole logic is awkward
I mean I could just do
I mean I could just do
CA neutral Target
and the difference is going to
be and then this works
what
happened crash and build calls
happened crash and build calls
what did I not allocate
I don't know why it tried to

weird thing
there cool so
there cool so
now this
now this
works uh we have to adjust the positions
works uh we have to adjust the positions
of the creeps I
believe I don't know why these guys are
believe I don't know why these guys are
stuck
here but cool
creeps still getting nomed are are
they wait did you see that I didn't see
they wait did you see that I didn't see
that
that
happen creeps are still getting numbed

yeah that's weird
well lots of little bugs to
fix let me see if this repo has the um

it's way way way faster than copilot as
it's way way way faster than copilot as
you can see the suggestions are almost

different numbers of way points on them
different numbers of way points on them
right that's a little bit concerning
but yeah so this is all of

I love writing a comment describing and

even this will like constantly

good okay so way points is now going to

be not this because this is garbage

as well there's an

this needs to go to a Lane right
hey JBL
hey JBL
welcome we are currently
welcome we are currently
adding uh neutral camps full map and
adding uh neutral camps full map and
we're fixing the pathing for these new
we're fixing the pathing for these new
maps the new
maps the new
map it's really
map it's really
cool as soon as I fix the pathing here
cool as soon as I fix the pathing here
you'll be able to see it with the
you'll be able to see it with the
respawn I
respawn I
mean um
so this is fine for like respawning the
so this is fine for like respawning the
player I
guess how you fixing pathing um cuz this
guess how you fixing pathing um cuz this
is now the actual DOTA map and I loaded
is now the actual DOTA map and I loaded
the way points that the actual creeps
the way points that the actual creeps
and DOTA use so
and DOTA use so
just like
that
mhm
so so obnoxious
so so obnoxious
I hate copying and pasting so much damn
code well self.
code well self.
waypoints Lane 0 0
waypoints Lane 0 0
and zero and
one Andals
brand what is it percent 7 minus 3 I
brand what is it percent 7 minus 3 I
believe okay so this is going to spawn
believe okay so this is going to spawn
near
here you get valid pause equals
true valid
pause move
pause move
to
YX um
[Music]
F valid
F valid
pause has got to be true anyways this is
pause has got to be true anyways this is
fine whatever
all right
one
second all
second all
right so
so spawn at y spawn X
so spawn at y spawn X
right empty valid
pause it works looks like it's fine
we also have to do I forgot the um when
we also have to do I forgot the um when
you respawn the
creep you have to set the way point
to to the.way point got to be set to
to to the.way point got to be set to
one then creep
half
e e
the thing is the way there are different
the thing is the way there are different
numbers of way points now so
key error
zero
oops the heck
there we go
key error zero y but do we have a
print uh right we have to set way points
print uh right we have to set way points
like
this no wa it's key
way so much fumbling around with this
right
so other way around here
if minus one not
if minus one not
in you just
break as soon as I get this working I'm
break as soon as I get this working I'm
taking a break to go grab a
taking a break to go grab a
shake
hungry but hopefully this works Maybe
boom um the creeps appear to have
boom um the creeps appear to have
spawned in the wrong
location spawn creep you give it a lane
location spawn creep you give it a lane
now now don't
you what
you what
happened what
happened what
happened damn this map looks yeah I'll
happened damn this map looks yeah I'll
show you so it's going to look way
show you so it's going to look way
cooler when the creeps are
working this is just the DOTA map like
working this is just the DOTA map like
we loaded this from DOTA data
so it's missing the trees and stuff but
so it's missing the trees and stuff but
this is just the full DOTA
map towers are gone again too damn it
map towers are gone again too damn it
okay well that's got to just be a over
okay well that's got to just be a over
that's like an off by whatever
that's like an off by whatever
error let's fix the darn creeps
[Music]
way points Lane
zero move to
YX
points oh wait this is only three lanes
points oh wait this is only three lanes
right
so this needs to be three times team
so this needs to be three times team
plus
Lane come on work
okay
okay
why we still have the uh NPCs they're
why we still have the uh NPCs they're
all spawned you can see that they're
all spawned you can see that they're
spawned in roughly the right spots even
spawned in roughly the right spots even
but
um huh
3 * TM plus
Lane I
print
Lane one has one way way point one way
Lane one has one way way point one way
point one way they all have one way
point one way they all have one way
point
so yeah it's just
um so way points equals entity data key
um so way points equals entity data key
way
way
points I in
range Len way
range Len way
Points Way points of
Points Way points of
I then way points I +
one we just weren't adding the way
one we just weren't adding the way
points
points
correctly but should have still spawned
correctly but should have still spawned
them I would have
them I would have
thought maybe not
uh the they got out now the mid ones got
out interesting
Lane 0 12 8 11
771 oh the start positions are
wrong Maybe
now okay nice
now okay nice
so now this actually looks like it
so now this actually looks like it
works we have the teams
works we have the teams
uh this is not going to run for long
uh this is not going to run for long
enough so I'm going to kill this so that
enough so I'm going to kill this so that
I can run it for longer
here and we're going to see how it
looks okay so missing Towers but let's
looks okay so missing Towers but let's
see how the NPCs
see how the NPCs
look so they are getting stuck at looks
look so they are getting stuck at looks
like some of them are getting stuck at
least the top ones are
fighting and then they just stop
that's
that's
weird hm it's very
weird hm it's very
close something's weird
though I'm going to add a debug type
and I'm going to add uh
and I'm going to add uh
here
debug so uh self.
grid here let's just do
yals one
y
y
x soft.
x soft.
Grid in
Grid in
y set this to debug
y set this to debug
right and
right and
then
then
upgrd
debug and then debug Point here is going
debug and then debug Point here is going
to be
to be
not
not
this uh we'll do like
this uh we'll do like
cyan wees that
right let's try this
this is way points
okay so let's see where the way points
go come
on perfect
so it's not letting me I think it's not
so it's not letting me I think it's not
spawning the
spawning the
agents but let's
see so this
is this is where we have our way points
I think that they this is for both
I think that they this is for both
sides
sides
so little odd
oh I know why this would prevent them
oh I know why this would prevent them
from
from
spawning I could
spawning I could
do nine
do nine
here minus four I don't know if this was
here minus four I don't know if this was
going to fix
anything kind of a big range get big
anything kind of a big range get big
radius to spawn
so that doesn't help
um I think this is is totally screwed up
um I think this is is totally screwed up
right here
differing Dimensions yeah
okay I think these need to be
okay I think these need to be
substantially larger
right it's 30
right it's 30
what's it -
what's it -
two
two maybe like
this possibly these boxes are just too
this possibly these boxes are just too
small
still no
like what even is this
like what even is this
one two
one two
three this is like
eight I can't tell where the hell it's
okay what I'm going to do is I'm going
okay what I'm going to do is I'm going
to just take a look at this this is here
can't even do it that way can I
the
hell why the hell is there's no open
hell why the hell is there's no open
with option is like way down in the
with option is like way down in the
menu
okay so divide by
two 12 and 15
it's like 12 and 15
it's like 12 and 15
right I don't know why the spawns are
right I don't know why the spawns are
not exactly symmetric
what did I say
here 15
Plus Grand percent
uh
uh
minus
5 okay try this
still
still
no
no
so I see this team spawned
so I see this team spawned
here
right team zero
right team zero
128 -
128 -
15 x - 12 I don't know how that's even
15 x - 12 I don't know how that's even
valid
code how the heck is that
code how the heck is that
oh oh yeah I know that is valid code
oh oh yeah I know that is valid code
stupid but
okay so now I
okay so now I
have I don't think that these are the
have I don't think that these are the
things that are screwing it
up I think it's the uh
it's got to be the spawning of creeps
right this
right this
thing let me just make sure oh we got
thing let me just make sure oh we got
better spawning out of that so that's
better spawning out of that so that's
nice
okay so it is the spawning of creep
waves or at least uh let's see if it's
waves or at least uh let's see if it's
the pathing or the spawning
okay it's the spawning
okay so you
okay so you
spawn
idx and
Lane then this calls a respawn
creep re respawn
reap and then what we're going to do is
reap and then what we're going to do is
we're just going to
we're just going to
print Y and
X see what the hell it thinks it's doing
okay well I had to kill the whole
okay well I had to kill the whole
container to get that to
container to get that to
work 94 and 15
is that
bad if I multiply by
bad if I multiply by
two roughly right 94 is going to be like
180 190 like
180 190 like
here 15 is like here isn't it
is that what I I
is that what I I
printed y comma
printed y comma
X so
90 somewhere here and 15 is like
90 somewhere here and 15 is like
somewhere
here I mean is it just like slightly off
here I mean is it just like slightly off
or something
well I'll tell you what we'll
well I'll tell you what we'll
do we
do we
will we'll
will we'll
do self.
do self.
grid this is going to be
grid this is going to be
debug
debug
okay and then we're going to make this
okay and then we're going to make this
like way larger so this is going to
like way larger so this is going to
be uh
be uh
15 and then minus
15 and then minus
7 so
hopefully hopefully now the creep can
spawn come
spawn come
on and still you can't spawn these
on and still you can't spawn these
bloody things
bloody things
along with these
bastards
ridiculous okay what if I do this
now it just works
and most of them actually path what
and most of them actually path what
looks like
correctly and then they get stuck on
correctly and then they get stuck on
this Waypoint
really I don't think these are
correct hold
on good
on good
top Okay so
they end up on the other side of the
they end up on the other side of the
map like they're supposed
map like they're supposed
to so they go up first few way points
to so they go up first few way points
are
are
up and then this is like a corner wayo
up and then this is like a corner wayo
it looks like if they're turning a
it looks like if they're turning a
corner here so they have a few more way
corner here so they have a few more way
points around the
points around the
corners quite a few way points around
corners quite a few way points around
the
the
corners and then there yeah this is
corners and then there yeah this is
definitely valid
good
mid
is yeah definitely they end up pretty
is yeah definitely they end up pretty
much at the
fountain this is bizarre
really really weird that
the well first of all this is me stupid
the well first of all this is me stupid
here this is
here this is
YX so let's fix this that's one bug
YX so let's fix this that's one bug
fixed
and
then and then what do we say we
then and then what do we say we
say end Waypoint creep

mirror into C structs which is awesome
mirror into C structs which is awesome
so lots of lots of nice things that it
so lots of lots of nice things that it
just gives you um
yeah lots of good things for
cython how much faster is it than
cython how much faster is it than
regular python it is native c-s speed
regular python it is native c-s speed
when optimized correctly native c-s
when optimized correctly native c-s
speed and why not use it for
speed and why not use it for
algorithms uh because well you are using
algorithms uh because well you are using
it for algorithms well not syon you're
it for algorithms well not syon you're
using C++ for the algorithms technically
using C++ for the algorithms technically
right all of the network calls are in
right all of the network calls are in
um are in pytorch right which is backed
um are in pytorch right which is backed
by C++ and Cuda so already is
what is going wrong
here uh lost my train of thought I'm
here uh lost my train of thought I'm
trying to remember what the heck was
trying to remember what the heck was
going wrong
here was it just me trying to figure oh
here was it just me trying to figure oh
I was trying to figure out the way
I was trying to figure out the way
points
we'll give him one
we'll give him one
extra no we'll give them one extra uh
extra no we'll give them one extra uh
creep
path oh well this is the issue right
path oh well this is the issue right
here
so they only had five way points
all right scyon what you got for
all right scyon what you got for
me we have some cool demo here or the
me we have some cool demo here or the
agent still going to be
agent still going to be
stuck I think some of them are still
stuck I think some of them are still
stuck right
that's
weird Okay so they path I don't know why
weird Okay so they path I don't know why
they're pathing here this is weird
so these ones attack
so these ones attack
here and then they attack
here
um I have to watch what happens when
um I have to watch what happens when
that crashes I think I have an idea of
that crashes I think I have an idea of
what's happening but I don't I'm not
what's happening but I don't I'm not
positive I think it's up here maybe when
positive I think it's up here maybe when
this one goes here
this one goes here
no maybe it's one that goes up
no maybe it's one that goes up
here let me just
watch Okay so that red one there is
watch Okay so that red one there is
actually pathing on the the Top Lane is
actually pathing on the the Top Lane is
pathing well it looks like
right Top Lane is pathing all the way
right Top Lane is pathing all the way
down and it passed to the
down and it passed to the
Fountain where it's going to fight this
Fountain where it's going to fight this
uh player character it's going to lose
uh player character it's going to lose
to the player character of
course and we have sever
course and we have sever
several oh they're just AGG gring to uh
several oh they're just AGG gring to uh
to neutrals that's all that's happening
to neutrals that's all that's happening
yeah minion shouldn't be fighting
yeah minion shouldn't be fighting
neutrals that's all that's happening and
neutrals that's all that's happening and
there are a couple pixels up here which
there are a couple pixels up here which
are uh just a little too close for
are uh just a little too close for
comfort
um let's
do okay so
red up
okay creep AI is gets entity
hopefully this now looks good we'll have
hopefully this now looks good we'll have
a cool demo I will then go get myself a
a cool demo I will then go get myself a
shake take about five minutes maybe six
shake take about five minutes maybe six
or seven to do that and then we will uh
or seven to do that and then we will uh
Implement leveling and other things for
Implement leveling and other things for
the next few
the next few
hours but should be a very nice demo
hours but should be a very nice demo
let's
see
see
so
here yep the agents go straight through
here yep the agents go straight through
these debug objects get in the way just
these debug objects get in the way just
ignore those we will uh you know those
ignore those we will uh you know those
will be removed we're missing towers
will be removed we're missing towers
still but the creeps are going to meet
still but the creeps are going to meet
they meet where the creeps are supposed
they meet where the creeps are supposed
to meet right
let's actually get rid of the debug way
points because they're getting in the
way okay get ready this is going to be
way okay get ready this is going to be
cool
you still using the Jitter logic
yep we do it this
yep we do it this
way
way
so they fight in the
middle they fight on the top and my
middle they fight on the top and my
camera's covering it but they fight on
camera's covering it but they fight on
the bottom
two uh White agents
two uh White agents
one they're going to continue pathing in
one they're going to continue pathing in
towards the
towards the
fountain and they are going to stop
fountain and they are going to stop
right where the uh that's where the
right where the uh that's where the
Nexus or whatever should
be you get some
fighting minor you know minor things
fighting minor you know minor things
that could be improved but this is
that could be improved but this is
pretty darn solid I'd say
pretty darn solid I'd say
neutral
neutral
camps
camps
waves full DOTA
map mini
map mini
mooba mini
MOBA it pretty
MOBA it pretty
cool yeah it's pretty
cool yeah it's pretty
cool here comes next wave
I don't like how they get stuck on stuff
I don't like how they get stuck on stuff
so often we might just trim a couple
so often we might just trim a couple
pixels here and there from the original
pixels here and there from the original
map just to make it a little easier for
map just to make it a little easier for
U minions to
path but look at
that tell me that's not
awesome that is so
cool okay I'm going to leave this uh I'm
cool okay I'm going to leave this uh I'm
going to leave this up and it's going to
going to leave this up and it's going to
eventually probably crash or something
eventually probably crash or something
but I'm going to go uh grab a shake do a
but I'm going to go uh grab a shake do a
couple of quick things and then I'll be
couple of quick things and then I'll be
right back and we will
right back and we will
[Music]
[Music]
Implement oh a bunch of stuff we'll
Implement oh a bunch of stuff we'll
probably play it a little bit to test it
probably play it a little bit to test it
we'll Implement uh we'll fix the towers
we'll Implement uh we'll fix the towers
cuz the towers are all messed up we'll
cuz the towers are all messed up we'll
do
do
leveling maybe we'll do some
leveling maybe we'll do some
balancing but this is actually
balancing but this is actually
like this is not terribly far from being
like this is not terribly far from being
a complete thing already
a complete thing already
um I mean this is actually pretty darn
um I mean this is actually pretty darn
close which is
close which is
cool I'll be
back
