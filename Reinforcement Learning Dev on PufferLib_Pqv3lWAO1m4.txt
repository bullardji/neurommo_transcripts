Hi. Quick morning session right
Hi. Quick morning session right
now. Just like a half hour stream and uh
now. Just like a half hour stream and uh
we're going to be looking at the results
we're going to be looking at the results
from last night's experiments. Launching
from last night's experiments. Launching
a few new ones. I'll grab breakfast and
a few new ones. I'll grab breakfast and
then we will come back and be here for
then we will come back and be here for
the whole rest of the day working on
the whole rest of the day working on
various bits of research.
mostly pre-release

90% on mazes is very very good. These
90% on mazes is very very good. These
are very good
are very good
results. I'd like to see some of the
results. I'd like to see some of the
curves.
These are pretty good.
If we just filter this
to there 18 runs that get above
85%. Not bad.
We
We
do few too
do few too
many
many
7% other nine runs. This is a reasonable
number. These are
number. These are
reasonable. We look at the hyperparams
reasonable. We look at the hyperparams
for this.
we get our stable hyperparameter
ranges. Pretty
cool. I actually think we can just like
cool. I actually think we can just like
set up the uh the meta sweep,
set up the uh the meta sweep,
right? Probably just set up the meta
right? Probably just set up the meta
sweep right now.
Let's do it this
way. All
right, that's all

Let's try the other

May as well get it set up on on the big
May as well get it set up on on the big

then be a good
idea. And let's see if we can just in
idea. And let's see if we can just in
the next 15 minutes or so, 20 minutes,
the next 15 minutes or so, 20 minutes,
get a a sweep running on meta. That
get a a sweep running on meta. That
would be the best.
Huh? That's bizarre,
right?
right?
Oh, 3.4 terabytes of experiments.
Lovely. That is from old
Lovely. That is from old
uh errors on the way that we were saving
uh errors on the way that we were saving

We also need
dev. No record file is found for
pip. Interesting.
Yeah, this already exists
Yeah, this already exists
anyways. We don't need to update
alternatives. We do need this. And I

believe

it's CUDA 128, right? Let's

Wait. The fact that they leave

The bar is pretty high there

for me to do clean up on just like

Right. We do need to do the jank build
Right. We do need to do the jank build

I think that this is the torch
I think that this is the torch

whole setup file work better.
Okay. Yeah. So, this is going to build
Okay. Yeah. So, this is going to build

when I start doing algorithm work, I'll

Cool. So, we now have this seeming to be
