we are back live.
Hi.

I am um quite tired today. Really quite

tired.
tired.
So,
So,
I think all I'm going to do for this
I think all I'm going to do for this
evening is I'm going to try to get a
evening is I'm going to try to get a
whole bunch of video clips of all these
whole bunch of video clips of all these
environments

um and get them nicely put together so I
um and get them nicely put together so I
can start looking for
can start looking for
an editor for this trailer
pretty much. It
realistically I can probably do that in
realistically I can probably do that in
the next like hourish.
the next like hourish.
And uh there are a couple other
And uh there are a couple other
environments that haven't been fully
environments that haven't been fully
fully fixed yet. Maybe I cue a couple
fully fixed yet. Maybe I cue a couple
experiments or whatever, but other than
experiments or whatever, but other than
that,
that,
that's about it for today.
Get myself
that up here.
I gotta say it's way nicer at least
I gotta say it's way nicer at least
having a comfortable chair

evening when I'm tired like this instead
of just being like I don't want to go to

my office chair. I'm just going to do
my office chair. I'm just going to do
whatever. It's at least I can just
whatever. It's at least I can just
relax a bit and do like this relatively
relax a bit and do like this relatively
easy chunk of work.
easy chunk of work.
How we're going to do it. Um
How we're going to do it. Um
probably we take like this thing

Take care of this.
I'll keep these off on the side.
I'll keep these off on the side.
Start recording.
perfectly good. Right.
We wait in Tetris. Yes.

We technically built a couple like small
We technically built a couple like small
things in finance. Um,
what do you mean the standard deviation?
what do you mean the standard deviation?
Do you mean the risk risk profile or uh
there's a whole bunch of stuff in there
like naive RL is going to do some crazy

Oh, for the action distribution.

Yeah, the action distribution like the

you're the word you're looking for I
you're the word you're looking for I

it's discrete or I guess the I guess it
it's discrete or I guess the I guess it
could be the standard deviation if it's
could be the standard deviation if it's
continuous. But that's just a learned
continuous. But that's just a learned
parameter of the neural network. Either

going to be I mean that you're looking

This has quickly become one of my

This is just like such a cool one.
This is just like such a cool one.
Really

look at this thing.
look at this thing.
Tetris Env is just awesome.
Tetris Env is just awesome.
I like it a lot.
All for trading. Na I mean naively doing
All for trading. Na I mean naively doing
RL for trading is laughable. Using it in
RL for trading is laughable. Using it in
some capacity if you know what you're
some capacity if you know what you're
doing isn't
you have to actually know what you're
you have to actually know what you're
doing. But
kind of magic that we just have all
kind of magic that we just have all
these working, huh?
Took so long to get it to this point,
Took so long to get it to this point,
but it's pretty magic.
You plan to add go.
You mean this
You can set the board size to be
You can set the board size to be
whatever you want. It's just a matter of
whatever you want. It's just a matter of
getting it to actually learn
getting it to actually learn
configurable.
You know,
it's not like we only implemented it for
it's not like we only implemented it for
small boards.
The main problem with Go is that uh it's
The main problem with Go is that uh it's
hard to write like a decent scripted bot

to play against. The action space is

very big and nobody knows the damn game.
very big and nobody knows the damn game.
Like you actually need to know what the

Nobody knows how to play the game.

Well, it definitely can't beat the

current soda go models because those use
current soda go models because those use
massive amounts of search. Um, but what
massive amounts of search. Um, but what
would be very interesting would be to
would be very interesting would be to
see if with like pure on policy RL you
see if with like pure on policy RL you
could beat amateur players. That would
could beat amateur players. That would
already be something pretty dang cool
already be something pretty dang cool
cuz that I don't think has been done.
cuz that I don't think has been done.
You're absolutely free to come try it.
We have the environment. We could use
We have the environment. We could use
somebody who actually knows the game to
somebody who actually knows the game to
look at it.
Give it a go.
Give it a go.
Yeah, we definitely we get it to solve
Yeah, we definitely we get it to solve
the small boards. Uh it doesn't work so
the small boards. Uh it doesn't work so
well on the larger boards.
well on the larger boards.
It might just be a matter of playing
It might just be a matter of playing
with hyperparameters and invalid move

like that though and rewards and

It's not a good run. Poppers are stuck.
What are you going to do with a stuck

Not that I'm aware of.
Um,
same map, no resale.
I don't know. Just see if it trains. If
I don't know. Just see if it trains. If
you just train it on that map, if it
you just train it on that map, if it
does anything
I want to get all these clips in.
That was kind of the idea, you know,
That was kind of the idea, you know,
when I made it was that this was going
when I made it was that this was going
to happen. I didn't expect it to happen
to happen. I didn't expect it to happen
this well so quickly, but
low render is just about fixed. What was
low render is just about fixed. What was
it, Bet?
Nothing's wrong with Blaster. I'm
Nothing's wrong with Blaster. I'm
getting clips, man.
Now, this is not going to be one of
Now, this is not going to be one of
those crazy things where you just you
those crazy things where you just you
have it fixed and you don't know how,
have it fixed and you don't know how,
right?
Hi, Matan.
Uh, yeah, I can chat about it. I'm

I am right in here.
Hold.
Let me read the thing back second.
It's covering it.

That all to be good.

ones that have weird issues.
Where'd my tan go?
Are you getting in the Discord or what?
Wanted to chat, right?
In the meantime, how do you feel about
In the meantime, how do you feel about
uh I bet for chess? How do I feel about
uh I bet for chess? How do I feel about
what dependencies for chess? Like say

maybe the local compile

Time to level up. Yeah, that is also
true. But you got to also do it in a way

these a couple of undergrads submitted
these a couple of undergrads submitted
earlier today was fantastic.
earlier today was fantastic.
Yeah, that was very cool. They had the
Yeah, that was very cool. They had the
GitHub. So, you know, I I was looking at
GitHub. So, you know, I I was looking at
the GitHub. Yeah, it looked it looked
the GitHub. Yeah, it looked it looked
reasonable. Already merged in on the
reasonable. Already merged in on the
like it's on the the beta build of the
like it's on the the beta build of the
site. All right, let let me just let me
site. All right, let let me just let me
just DM you this. Uh just so you know,
just DM you this. Uh just so you know,
the shift pressing shift crashes it. So
the shift pressing shift crashes it. So
this that's not No, hold on. I'll DM you
this that's not No, hold on. I'll DM you
the the speed fix. We'll fix that first.
the the speed fix. We'll fix that first.
All right. All right. Shift is shift is
All right. All right. Shift is shift is
human control. So critical. Don't do
human control. So critical. Don't do
that. Yeah.
that. Yeah.
Ideally. Yeah. Well, we we won't.
Ideally. Yeah. Well, we we won't.
Also, I think I don't know if Spencer
Also, I think I don't know if Spencer
fixed it or not, but the whatever the
fixed it or not, but the whatever the
hell you did broke tower climb training.
hell you did broke tower climb training.
Yeah, train training, you know, may may
Yeah, train training, you know, may may
or may not have worked. That was just a
or may not have worked. That was just a
fancy fancy looking render. You're
fancy fancy looking render. You're
supposed to not break training in the
supposed to not break training in the
process. Did he fix it? Let me see. I
process. Did he fix it? Let me see. I
forget if he said that he did. If he
forget if he said that he did. If he
fixed it, that's wonderful.
fixed it, that's wonderful.
[ __ ] I I already I already spent all
[ __ ] I I already I already spent all
night all all morning and all all night
night all all morning and all all night
on that
on that
an operate training again. Well,
an operate training again. Well,
so the thing is you can you could render
so the thing is you can you could render
the you could render it the same because
the you could render it the same because
I didn't change anything that matters,
I didn't change anything that matters,
right? It's just shiny here.
Spencer power climb trains
like like like
like like like
that's I changed the rendering function
that's I changed the rendering function
only so it shouldn't not that's weird
only so it shouldn't not that's weird
something happened then. Well yeah we
something happened then. Well yeah we
have ants to discuss though. Yep. By all
have ants to discuss though. Yep. By all
means.
means.
Yeah. So, um, basically what I've done
Yeah. So, um, basically what I've done
is I've simplified the ant simulator
is I've simplified the ant simulator
pretty significantly
pretty significantly
by, um, making the movements much wider.
by, um, making the movements much wider.
So, um, I had this suspicion that the
So, um, I had this suspicion that the
action space was too wide where it was
action space was too wide where it was
like able to turn on a single degree um,
like able to turn on a single degree um,
not have that much change. So, I made it
not have that much change. So, I made it
change turn 90 degrees every time it
change turn 90 degrees every time it
turns. And that led to this behavior
turns. And that led to this behavior
where the reward function will spike
where the reward function will spike
early on and then fall back down for
early on and then fall back down for
whatever reason. Um, and so I'm trying
whatever reason. Um, and so I'm trying
to figure out how to prevent it from
to figure out how to prevent it from
falling back down or what's causing
falling back down or what's causing
that. I looked at uh the food
that. I looked at uh the food
respawning. Um, so originally there was
respawning. Um, so originally there was
no respawn for the food when they have
no respawn for the food when they have
fully consumed a food source. And so I
fully consumed a food source. And so I
think that was leading to like this late
think that was leading to like this late
crash in the training that I um have
crash in the training that I um have
since fixed. But now there's like this
since fixed. But now there's like this
spike behavior at the beginning that I'm
spike behavior at the beginning that I'm
trying to figure out. Um
trying to figure out. Um
I can show you guys what I'm talking
I can show you guys what I'm talking
about. Second.
about. Second.
Yeah. I'm also at the same time I'm
Yeah. I'm also at the same time I'm
recording all the clips of all these
recording all the clips of all these
ends for uh for the release. The idea is
ends for uh for the release. The idea is
that we have like 25 of these. I'm gonna
that we have like 25 of these. I'm gonna
get clips for all of them and then find
get clips for all of them and then find
myself an editor. Yeah, just go ahead
myself an editor. Yeah, just go ahead
and show me this the end whenever you
and show me this the end whenever you
want.
want.
Yeah. So, um I'll show you the latest
Yeah. So, um I'll show you the latest
Neptune run.
Neptune run.
And this spike has been happening
And this spike has been happening
predictably whenever I do a training run
predictably whenever I do a training run
where the reward will spike up, the
where the reward will spike up, the
score will spike up, and then it will
score will spike up, and then it will
fall back down and then just kind of
fall back down and then just kind of
stay down for the rest of the run. Yeah.
stay down for the rest of the run. Yeah.
So that kind of implies that you get
So that kind of implies that you get
some reward at the start just by acting
some reward at the start just by acting
randomly and then the end dynamics
randomly and then the end dynamics
change or similar.
change or similar.
It's probably just that there's a bunch
It's probably just that there's a bunch
of food around at the start and it is
of food around at the start and it is
not respawning in a reasonable way.
not respawning in a reasonable way.
Yeah. So I've tried uh doing this step
Yeah. So I've tried uh doing this step
where um let me have you rendered it?
where um let me have you rendered it?
Repo's open. I have. Yeah. So, there is
Repo's open. I have. Yeah. So, there is
a minimum distance from the starter
a minimum distance from the starter
colony for food to arrive. And I've done
colony for food to arrive. And I've done
a run where I literally just increase
a run where I literally just increase
that distance threefold. And the same
that distance threefold. And the same
spike behavior is still visible. So, I
spike behavior is still visible. So, I
don't think it has anything to do with
don't think it has anything to do with
the uh distance from the colony. This
the uh distance from the colony. This
used to be 100 here. Um
used to be 100 here. Um
but basically um I changed the um turn
but basically um I changed the um turn
radius to pi over two. So uh only four
radius to pi over two. So uh only four
different directions it can go. And I
different directions it can go. And I
added an observation where um it has the
added an observation where um it has the
current direction normalized between
current direction normalized between
zero and one. Um so this will always be
zero and one. Um so this will always be
one of these four values.
one of these four values.
Um, and otherwise the these are the
Um, and otherwise the these are the
same. So it still has the distance
same. So it still has the distance
squared from the ant to the colony uh as
squared from the ant to the colony uh as
well as the distance squared from the
well as the distance squared from the
ant to the food. Um, and I've changed uh
ant to the food. Um, and I've changed uh
is in vision to always return true. So
is in vision to always return true. So
um, their range of sight is essentially
um, their range of sight is essentially
infinite right now.
infinite right now.
Is it playable? Does it change? Yeah.
Is it playable? Does it change? Yeah.
Let's see. Can you play it and like get
Let's see. Can you play it and like get
food and that all works?
food and that all works?
Yeah. So, I can This is them moving
Yeah. So, I can This is them moving
randomly. Um, if I hit shift, they all
randomly. Um, if I hit shift, they all
uh perform the way I've uh scripted them
uh perform the way I've uh scripted them
to perform. You can see they're able to
to perform. You can see they're able to
get food, bring it back uh with no
get food, bring it back uh with no
issue. Um,
issue. Um,
so this all works. This is with the um
so this all works. This is with the um
movements
movements
um sort of prescripted. That's like
um sort of prescripted. That's like
That's like 300 ticks to like get the
That's like 300 ticks to like get the
food and bring it back.
food and bring it back.
Yeah. Uh yeah. So you're saying if I
Yeah. Uh yeah. So you're saying if I
were to leave it randomly, how many
were to leave it randomly, how many
ticks would it take for them to get
ticks would it take for them to get
food? Like that's like a ridiculously
food? Like that's like a ridiculously
deep exploration problem at the moment.
deep exploration problem at the moment.
Like 300 time steps is like a really
Like 300 time steps is like a really
long credit assignment problem.
The time is not perceived continuously,
The time is not perceived continuously,
right? Like if you just make the frame
right? Like if you just make the frame
rate, if they move at the same speed in
rate, if they move at the same speed in
real time, you just make it like a
real time, you just make it like a
thousand frames, like a thousand frames
thousand frames, like a thousand frames
for each of these movements or whatever,
for each of these movements or whatever,
you break all learning like pure
you break all learning like pure
algorithmically because you need to get
algorithmically because you need to get
reward signal in order for credit
reward signal in order for credit
assignment to occur. These ants are are
assignment to occur. These ants are are
lost it looks like. Yeah, these they
lost it looks like. Yeah, these they
don't pursue
don't pursue
randomly.
randomly.
Oh, what about the trained? Yeah. So,
Oh, what about the trained? Yeah. So,
it's literally it takes them it's going
it's literally it takes them it's going
to take them like 10,000 ticks to get
to take them like 10,000 ticks to get
anything.
Yeah. So, um it will take at least 300
Yeah. So, um it will take at least 300
for them or 100. What happens if you 10x
for them or 100. What happens if you 10x
the speed their speed? Yeah. Yeah. So,
the speed their speed? Yeah. Yeah. So,
we can do that. Get a get a nightmare
we can do that. Get a get a nightmare
scenario.
scenario.
Um, man. You know what I did? Let's see.
Um, man. You know what I did? Let's see.
I woke up on farm, found a cockroach,
I woke up on farm, found a cockroach,
even though there's literally no food in
even though there's literally no food in
here, and then I went for a run, nearly
here, and then I went for a run, nearly
stepped on a snapping turtle, nearly
stepped on a snapping turtle, nearly
stepped on a snake, came back, took a
stepped on a snake, came back, took a
shower, went to dry my uh to dry myself,
shower, went to dry my uh to dry myself,
and I had like some big brown spider
and I had like some big brown spider
jump off the towel onto the back of my
jump off the towel onto the back of my
neck, and I had to like grab it off of
neck, and I had to like grab it off of
there. You [ __ ] thing. I was more I
there. You [ __ ] thing. I was more I
was more pissed about the snake though.
was more pissed about the snake though.
Spider won't kill you. Oh, the snake.
Spider won't kill you. Oh, the snake.
There aren't no There are not deadly
There aren't no There are not deadly
snakes there. We have copperheads and
snakes there. We have copperheads and
water moccasins. They will absolutely
water moccasins. They will absolutely
kill you. Yeah, copperheads are [ __ ]
kill you. Yeah, copperheads are [ __ ]
Yeah. And uh you're not getting to the
Yeah. And uh you're not getting to the
hospital in time around here. And they
hospital in time around here. And they
probably don't have them. Is this is
probably don't have them. Is this is
this 10x speed? Did you recompile?
this 10x speed? Did you recompile?
No. So, this is uh the eval uh this is
No. So, this is uh the eval uh this is
the most recent training run trained
the most recent training run trained
after you change the I mean um so you
after you change the I mean um so you
can see we've already gotten to like
can see we've already gotten to like
2500 ticks and they haven't been able to
2500 ticks and they haven't been able to
bring any food back. Yeah, because it's
bring any food back. Yeah, because it's
freaking it's like it takes too many
freaking it's like it takes too many
ticks to do anything in this game. It's
ticks to do anything in this game. It's
extremely difficult for them to get to
extremely difficult for them to get to
food. Okay, so let's uh try think of
food. Okay, so let's uh try think of
think of one tick equals 1 second.
think of one tick equals 1 second.
That's like a better analogy for like
That's like a better analogy for like
how the RL agent sees things. All right.
how the RL agent sees things. All right.
So you basically it takes five minutes
So you basically it takes five minutes
to do anything. And there's a there's a
to do anything. And there's a there's a
there's like a there's a horizon too
there's like a there's a horizon too
with with respect to the the policy
with with respect to the the policy
seeing what's happened certain number of
seeing what's happened certain number of
steps ago. So
steps ago. So
it doesn't just know the agent just
it doesn't just know the agent just
thinks so much faster than you that
thinks so much faster than you that
after a few hundred frames, it's only
after a few hundred frames, it's only
been a few a few seconds for you, but
been a few a few seconds for you, but
it's been like several minutes to them
it's been like several minutes to them
and they get bored.
and they get bored.
Well, yeah, it's it's getting no not
Well, yeah, it's it's getting no not
much reward, right? Unless you're But
much reward, right? Unless you're But
it's funner. It's more fun to say it the
it's funner. It's more fun to say it the
sci-fi way that makes no sense. Well,
sci-fi way that makes no sense. Well,
you know,
you know,
it gets it gets it gets bored. Sure.
it gets it gets it gets bored. Sure.
That's
You sent me a command, Dan, to uh
You sent me a command, Dan, to uh
rebuild. It's been a long time since I
rebuild. It's been a long time since I
ran it. So, it's uh build ocean. Search
ran it. So, it's uh build ocean. Search
for ocean. Oh, no. I have the build
for ocean. Oh, no. I have the build
ocean command. Um I'm looking for the

Holy terraforming Spencer.
What's it going to be? Trying to I'm
What's it going to be? Trying to I'm
trying to remember. No, let me pull it.

I gotta pull

it's uh just uh my credit assignment for

Terra is 1020. It's pip. It's not pip.
Terra is 1020. It's pip. It's not pip.
It's a Python setup. What do you mean
It's a Python setup. What do you mean
your credit assignment is 1024, Spencer?
You gota be You're trolling if it is.

There you go. That one. I know. I know
There you go. That one. I know. I know
it isn't because I set up the time the

Yeah, that's not what credit credit
Yeah, that's not what credit credit
assignment not equal episode length.

That's not how that works.
Oh, uh question for how I can think
Oh, uh question for how I can think
about this um as I'm I'm writing this
about this um as I'm I'm writing this
out. So, um, right now the ants, um,
out. So, um, right now the ants, um,
find.
find.
Yeah. So, I'm giving them a very simple
Yeah. So, I'm giving them a very simple
reward, which is just, um, one reward
reward, which is just, um, one reward
for picking up food and a big reward of
for picking up food and a big reward of
50 for bringing it all the way back to
50 for bringing it all the way back to
the car. That's the same thing as giving
the car. That's the same thing as giving
them one for each. It's going to clip to
them one for each. It's going to clip to
one anyways.
Okay. So the magnitude of reward isn't
Okay. So the magnitude of reward isn't
that relevant. It is very relevant. It's
that relevant. It is very relevant. It's
just that we we clip rewards between
just that we we clip rewards between
negative one and one precisely to
negative one and one precisely to
prevent people from crashing learning by
prevent people from crashing learning by
doing that because if you give it 50,
doing that because if you give it 50,
you'll just break you'll break the RL
you'll just break you'll break the RL
because you'll have massive gradients
because you'll have massive gradients
and you'll just like nan everything.
and you'll just like nan everything.
Okay. Yeah, I see. So in the ants.py pi
Okay. Yeah, I see. So in the ants.py pi
I've got these um action spaces and
I've got these um action spaces and
observation spaces. Um
observation spaces. Um
the action spaces between or sorry
the action spaces between or sorry
observation space is between zero and
observation space is between zero and
one right. Um last time we mentioned
one right. Um last time we mentioned
that uh if they have something that's
that uh if they have something that's
outside their range of sight we should
outside their range of sight we should
have the thing being given as minus one.
have the thing being given as minus one.
Will that be ignored or will it be
Will that be ignored or will it be
treated as zero or should I be changing
treated as zero or should I be changing
the lower bound here?
the lower bound here?
Should probably change the lower bound,
Should probably change the lower bound,
but I'll be surprised if that does
but I'll be surprised if that does
anything.
anything.
Okay. Yeah, this part where um if in
Okay. Yeah, this part where um if in
this case it's irrelevant because there
this case it's irrelevant because there
will always be food and there uh the
will always be food and there uh the
vision will always return true. But for
vision will always return true. But for
when there's limited vision, we were
when there's limited vision, we were
going to set these observations to be
going to set these observations to be
negative one. Um, fine.
negative one. Um, fine.
So, would that be treated as zero in
So, would that be treated as zero in
here? Would that How would that uh No,
here? Would that How would that uh No,
it probably just gets treated as
it probably just gets treated as
negative one. I don't think we actually
negative one. I don't think we actually
enforce the OBS bounds for um for puffer
enforce the OBS bounds for um for puffer
ends, native ms. You're kind of going on
ends, native ms. You're kind of going on
expert mode. We probably should, but
expert mode. We probably should, but
yeah, you should just change that bound
yeah, you should just change that bound
to be a negative oneative one to one.
Cool. And then um
Cool. And then um
let me think. Yes. Uh the other thing I
let me think. Yes. Uh the other thing I
was thinking about was
was thinking about was
um
um
the observation size. So um right now
the observation size. So um right now
it is eight different things. That's um
it is eight different things. That's um
okay. If this uh changes, is that what
okay. If this uh changes, is that what
this shape corresponds to? Yes. is the
this shape corresponds to? Yes. is the
number of ops that you have per agent.
number of ops that you have per agent.
Okay. Yeah. And then for the things that
Okay. Yeah. And then for the things that
are being logged like score, is this the
are being logged like score, is this the
average across all the agents for that
average across all the agents for that
particular epoch or how can I interpret
particular epoch or how can I interpret
these log except except that you you're
these log except except that you you're
responsible for doing that manually? So
responsible for doing that manually? So
every time you add something to the logs
every time you add something to the logs
and you increment n like you're gonna
and you increment n like you're gonna
the thing it's just going to take
the thing it's just going to take
literally all it does is it takes
literally all it does is it takes
everything in log and then it divide
everything in log and then it divide
divides by that n.
You see?
You see?
So if you log at the end of every like
So if you log at the end of every like
whenever an agent dies if you log your
whenever an agent dies if you log your
score then you increment n by one then
score then you increment n by one then
it's going to be the average over agent
it's going to be the average over agent
lifetimes.
lifetimes.
If you just like wait 300 steps, right,
If you just like wait 300 steps, right,
and then you log once everything at the
and then you log once everything at the
end of 300 steps, then it's going to be
end of 300 steps, then it's going to be
the average, you know, the average
the average, you know, the average
result over segments of 300 steps. It
result over segments of 300 steps. It
depends on how you do it.
depends on how you do it.
Basically, all we do, right, is we set
Basically, all we do, right, is we set
up the average for you.
up the average for you.
So, yeah. So, in here, uh, when I have
So, yeah. So, in here, uh, when I have
the terminal condition, uh, and I'm
the terminal condition, uh, and I'm
incrementing n, that's going to be the
incrementing n, that's going to be the
way that this gets divided off. Yep. By
way that this gets divided off. Yep. By
the way, there n equals one is saying
the way, there n equals one is saying
that this thing is averaging over one
that this thing is averaging over one
sample only. You're probably like
sample only. You're probably like
reporting very very frequently or
reporting very very frequently or
something.
something.
Yeah, it seems like the score has
Yeah, it seems like the score has
dropped to zero and staying there for
dropped to zero and staying there for
some reason too. You recompile with the
some reason too. You recompile with the
um the with the increased speed. Yeah,
um the with the increased speed. Yeah,
interesting.
I mean getting actual zero score. It's
I mean getting actual zero score. It's
like I you always got to check if
like I you always got to check if
something went wrong with the end as
something went wrong with the end as
well.
The food is supposed to grow back,
The food is supposed to grow back,
right? It is. Yeah. So, as soon as food
right? It is. Yeah. So, as soon as food
uh gets there's like a hundred units of
uh gets there's like a hundred units of
food in one of those green circles. As
food in one of those green circles. As
soon as one of the green circles
soon as one of the green circles
disappears, a new one appears somewhere
disappears, a new one appears somewhere
else on the map. Equally far from the

original colony. Well, I mean, see
original colony. Well, I mean, see
what's happening. At least now stuff
what's happening. At least now stuff
should be faster.
Yeah, let me make sure that something's
Yeah, let me make sure that something's
been saved.
been saved.
I mean, there are a number of different
I mean, there are a number of different
ways that we do this. Um, like
ways that we do this. Um, like
technically the best way to do it is
technically the best way to do it is
uh we like smooth the frame rate or
uh we like smooth the frame rate or
whatever. So,
like basically it won't be running super
like basically it won't be running super
fast but it'll still be smooth. Um I
fast but it'll still be smooth. Um I
don't know like probably good to look at
don't know like probably good to look at
for how we do that. Maybe ourware
for how we do that. Maybe ourware
ourware is a good example of that but
ourware is a good example of that but
doesn't make a huge difference. It's
doesn't make a huge difference. It's
just going to render kind of fast as
just going to render kind of fast as
well.
Yeah. So they're running very fast and
Yeah. So they're running very fast and
they're leaving pherommones behind very
they're leaving pherommones behind very
fast.
fast.
Um, something looks wrong.
Um, something looks wrong.
Why are there pherommones everywhere and
Why are there pherommones everywhere and
why are they evenly spaced?
why are they evenly spaced?
Yeah, I'm wondering the same thing here.
Yeah, I'm wondering the same thing here.
Isn't it Is the movement continuous?
Isn't it Is the movement continuous?
Um, yeah. So, the the movement is going
Um, yeah. So, the the movement is going
to be um continuous in one direction
to be um continuous in one direction
until they turn. So, what is the action
until they turn. So, what is the action
space? It's like move and turn or
space? It's like move and turn or
something. It's turn left and turn
something. It's turn left and turn
right. By drop
right. By drop
uh by 90 degrees. Oh, well that's why
uh by 90 degrees. Oh, well that's why
they they're on a grid. It's they can
they they're on a grid. It's they can
only move on a grid.
Yeah, they um I'm more so thinking
Yeah, they um I'm more so thinking
wouldn't they uh turn at different
wouldn't they uh turn at different
times? But they do seem to do that. Like
times? But they do seem to do that. Like
the grid isn't perfectly um gridlike.
Yeah, this is uh be getting any food at
Yeah, this is uh be getting any food at
all. No, this is looks like random
all. No, this is looks like random
movement to me. Yeah, it looks like
movement to me. Yeah, it looks like
random movement that's been accelerated.
But okay, I'm I'm curious. Um, what can
But okay, I'm I'm curious. Um, what can
you tell me about um you mentioned
you tell me about um you mentioned
there's like too much in-game time
there's like too much in-game time
taking place between rewards, right?
taking place between rewards, right?
Um so one of the solutions I had to that
Um so one of the solutions I had to that
was uh implementing a reward where um I
was uh implementing a reward where um I
have like a small positive reward for
have like a small positive reward for
heading towards visible food. Um I was
heading towards visible food. Um I was
doing like this as my reward for every
doing like this as my reward for every
time step that the angle difference is
time step that the angle difference is
less than the turn angle. You can try
less than the turn angle. You can try
that type of a thing and like that can
that type of a thing and like that can
work. It's better just to like the thing
work. It's better just to like the thing
is making them faster is equivalent to
is making them faster is equivalent to
uh applying like a frame skip. Another
uh applying like a frame skip. Another
common technique. Look, the problem here
common technique. Look, the problem here
is right like you have this temporal
is right like you have this temporal
hierarchy thing baked into you where you
hierarchy thing baked into you where you
don't experience time in plank seconds,
don't experience time in plank seconds,
right? Like it you don't experience like
right? Like it you don't experience like
each frame as it comes like you
each frame as it comes like you
experience this time continuum where a
experience this time continuum where a
second feels like a relatively short

amount of time despite you actually
amount of time despite you actually
being able to uh see like you're being
being able to uh see like you're being
able to process stuff substantially
able to process stuff substantially
faster than that. Um the agent on the
faster than that. Um the agent on the
other hand doesn't have that. They get
other hand doesn't have that. They get
this like these discrete time steps,
this like these discrete time steps,
right? Where they kind of expect
right? Where they kind of expect
something to happen and there to be
something to happen and there to be
cause effect over that time frame. So
cause effect over that time frame. So
unless you want to get into fancier
unless you want to get into fancier
architecture research, um that's kind of
architecture research, um that's kind of
just a thing you have to deal with. And
just a thing you have to deal with. And
the easiest way to deal with that is to
the easiest way to deal with that is to
try to make sure that at least simpler
try to make sure that at least simpler
environments have rewards that are
environments have rewards that are
accessible within tens of steps. In more
accessible within tens of steps. In more
complex ones, maybe it's within
complex ones, maybe it's within
hundreds, but then like then we start
hundreds, but then like then we start
doing more sophisticated stuff than
doing more sophisticated stuff than
you're doing here to make that work.
you're doing here to make that work.
Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. So
Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. So
what if we reduced the minimum distance
what if we reduced the minimum distance

and then back to something reasonable
size of a food source to something like
size of a food source to something like
20, right? So then and also make them
20, right? So then and also make them
move at a reasonable speed because I
move at a reasonable speed because I
think they're overshooting the food at
think they're overshooting the food at

That way we can compare

super jerryrigged policy to make that
super jerryrigged policy to make that
work. Well, sure. You know, it's just
work. Well, sure. You know, it's just
basically a demo, right? Yeah.
basically a demo, right? Yeah.
But I'm talking longer term. That was uh
But I'm talking longer term. That was uh
my first attempt at uh curriculum
my first attempt at uh curriculum
learning.
learning.
That was
That was
of the smallest degree. Yeah. Because
of the smallest degree. Yeah. Because
the terraforming problem becomes harder
the terraforming problem becomes harder
as you solve it. Um because more dirt is
as you solve it. Um because more dirt is
in the right place and dirt you need to
in the right place and dirt you need to
grab from is in potentially further away
grab from is in potentially further away
places. That makes sense. Um so you have
places. That makes sense. Um so you have
to explore more to get probably less
to explore more to get probably less

But did you didn't use curriculum
But did you didn't use curriculum
learning though, did you?
learning though, did you?
Um, I did one task that got it up to

into very similar issues if we if uh we
into very similar issues if we if uh we
end up doing multiple dozers because
end up doing multiple dozers because
like
like
it's a similar issue where if you want
it's a similar issue where if you want
to get things to cooperate, you have to
to get things to cooperate, you have to
kind of do a bunch of other stuff
or you know just reward it, right? You
or you know just reward it, right? You
have to tune the
Yeah, I'm thinking if we want them to um
Yeah, I'm thinking if we want them to um
in the case of the ants emerge the
in the case of the ants emerge the
collaborative use of pherommones
collaborative use of pherommones
um I think they it's something that they
um I think they it's something that they
need to naturally figure out for
need to naturally figure out for
themselves. So I feel like hard coding
themselves. So I feel like hard coding
reward functions to get them to
reward functions to get them to
collaborate is one thing. Um, but if you
collaborate is one thing. Um, but if you
can kind of make the reward function
can kind of make the reward function
general enough, they can start to just
general enough, they can start to just
realize like, hey, we can work faster if
realize like, hey, we can work faster if
we do it this way. And if they're all on
we do it this way. And if they're all on
the same policy, then there's no reason
the same policy, then there's no reason
for them not to emerge that kind of
for them not to emerge that kind of

I do think a general reward structure
I do think a general reward structure
can work. It just makes it you have to
can work. It just makes it you have to
train it, I think, for like way way way
train it, I think, for like way way way
way longer because I ran into things
way longer because I ran into things
when I was doing this with dozers when I
when I was doing this with dozers when I
was doing multiple on on the demo. was
was doing multiple on on the demo. was
doing single so I could easily solve
doing single so I could easily solve
because I gave up a multiple for the
because I gave up a multiple for the

things where they were competing with
things where they were competing with
each other for resources
each other for resources
and then also in the environment before
and then also in the environment before
I was like splitting them up into
I was like splitting them up into
quadrants for them to solve and then say
quadrants for them to solve and then say
there's two neighboring quadrants they
there's two neighboring quadrants they
would steal each other's dirt as well.
would steal each other's dirt as well.
Interesting. And so I would create like
Interesting. And so I would create like
penalties to do like so like don't like

screw up with things that are done.
screw up with things that are done.
don't like take things from your
don't like take things from your
neighbors and stuff like that. And that
neighbors and stuff like that. And that
actually that worked. Um,
actually that worked. Um,
but it didn't necessarily make them
but it didn't necessarily make them
cooperate. It just made them like not
cooperate. It just made them like not
try to ruin each other like
try to ruin each other like
independently solve.
independently solve.
Yeah, that's interesting. It's like a
Yeah, that's interesting. It's like a
mini society. You got to enforce
mini society. You got to enforce
punishments when it comes to bad
punishments when it comes to bad

But I do think you could probably get
But I do think you could probably get
away with it without any penalties on
away with it without any penalties on
that degree.
that degree.
um if you did like a proper shared
um if you did like a proper shared
reward and maybe some degree of like

independent
independent
two um team rewards that you would kneel
two um team rewards that you would kneel
over.
over.
So were these uh dozers on different
So were these uh dozers on different
teams in some way in the policy? Um, no.
teams in some way in the policy? Um, no.
I guess what I mean by is like in the
I guess what I mean by is like in the
beginning you focus on the individual
beginning you focus on the individual
rewards so that it can like learn the
rewards so that it can like learn the
mechanics of what it's even doing and
mechanics of what it's even doing and
then over time you weight them less and
then over time you weight them less and
then you weight the team rewards higher.
then you weight the team rewards higher.
Yeah,
Yeah,
because in the end of the day the whole
because in the end of the day the whole
thing is one team. Like in in this
thing is one team. Like in in this
problem there's not multiple teams. Is
problem there's not multiple teams. Is
it just like as many dozers on the map
it just like as many dozers on the map
working together
working together
to get the map to to get it like 100%
to get the map to to get it like 100%
from original dirt, whatever your
from original dirt, whatever your
original topology is um to your target.
Yeah. I mean, I think um you're probably
Yeah. I mean, I think um you're probably
right that we're going to run into
right that we're going to run into
similar things. Like I'm still on the
similar things. Like I'm still on the
part of trying to get them to even
part of trying to get them to even
figure out the mechanics of what they're
figure out the mechanics of what they're
doing.
doing.
But I think
But I think
once it's there, it should be an
once it's there, it should be an
interesting problem to see um how to get
interesting problem to see um how to get
them to collaborate or what their
them to collaborate or what their
propensity is or is not to collaborate
propensity is or is not to collaborate
given the reports.
given the reports.
Um, I wonder if there's some kind of
Um, I wonder if there's some kind of
function that you can show like um you
function that you can show like um you
define certain um non-colaborative or
define certain um non-colaborative or
collaborative behaviors
collaborative behaviors
um in a way that's like easy to verify.
um in a way that's like easy to verify.
Um and then you
Um and then you
tune the reward function up one way or
tune the reward function up one way or
another if there's some kind of
another if there's some kind of
relationship between those variables
relationship between those variables
that you can show.
that you can show.
There's probably something in that in
There's probably something in that in
that realm with what you just said that
that realm with what you just said that
works. Um I think it just comes down to
works. Um I think it just comes down to
how you're going to define that. And I
how you're going to define that. And I
think you just define it through your
think you just define it through your
reward structure though. Like what what
reward structure though. Like what what
are the tasks that actually require
are the tasks that actually require
teamwork versus not?
teamwork versus not?
Yeah. I mean I think also there's a way
Yeah. I mean I think also there's a way
to think about it in the in the case of
to think about it in the in the case of
the ants. It's like pherommones, right?
the ants. It's like pherommones, right?
We want them to use pherommones to
We want them to use pherommones to
communicate with each other. So the more
communicate with each other. So the more
highly weighted
highly weighted
the pheromone sense is to actual end
the pheromone sense is to actual end
behaviors, the more they've learned to
behaviors, the more they've learned to
use pherommones in a way that's actually
use pherommones in a way that's actually
productive, right?
productive, right?
I guess it comes down to with that like
I guess it comes down to with that like
concept, right? Where you're using
concept, right? Where you're using
pherommones
pherommones
under the assumption that like ants
under the assumption that like ants
leave pherommones behind and therefore
leave pherommones behind and therefore
another ant has to use it. Um,
how are you going to tie that together
how are you going to tie that together
though?

Like at the future state, you know what
Like at the future state, you know what
I mean? Like say you get your food, but
I mean? Like say you get your food, but
like how are you going to tie that to
like how are you going to tie that to
the fact that you did use the pheromone
the fact that you did use the pheromone
of ant A or B? Are you just going to
of ant A or B? Are you just going to
have like a path? Are you going to like
have like a path? Are you going to like
constantly recalculate paths and if they
constantly recalculate paths and if they
intersected or something? I'm looking
intersected or something? I'm looking
for something that's not just like paste
for something that's not just like paste
all the clips together. I'm looking to
all the clips together. I'm looking to
see if I can find somebody that come
see if I can find somebody that come
will come up with a creative way to like
will come up with a creative way to like
convey what we've built using these
convey what we've built using these
clips plus whatever else. And uh yeah,
clips plus whatever else. And uh yeah,
I'm looking ideally to like convey what
I'm looking ideally to like convey what
we've built to a slightly wider
we've built to a slightly wider
audience. I'm going to be paying
audience. I'm going to be paying
somebody. That'll be taking a lot of
somebody. That'll be taking a lot of
work. The 30 second trailer, we'll pay a
work. The 30 second trailer, we'll pay a
few hundred bucks for it.
few hundred bucks for it.
Like I could line them all up pretty
Like I could line them all up pretty
easily, but uh yeah, I can I mean I'm
easily, but uh yeah, I can I mean I'm
looking for somebody who's done this
looking for somebody who's done this
type of stuff and play them and um I
type of stuff and play them and um I
don't know what they charge for this. I
don't know what they charge for this. I
think it's probably like a few hundred
think it's probably like a few hundred
bucks.
It's it's worth it's worth it for sure
It's it's worth it's worth it for sure
to to have someone I mean I like the
to to have someone I mean I like the
goal is that we get something something
goal is that we get something something
that's going to get us like you know uh
that's going to get us like you know uh
like a thousand like you know 100k views
like a thousand like you know 100k views
or whatever thousand likes like actually
or whatever thousand likes like actually
have like a big post for the release.
I'm trying to like find basically like
I'm trying to like find basically like
if they can double the engagement that
if they can double the engagement that
we'd expect that's good value
we'd expect that's good value
for sure.
for sure.
Yeah, for this release like this is the
Yeah, for this release like this is the
one we want people to see.
This is funny.
All right, I'm going to head out and
All right, I'm going to head out and
grab food. Oh yeah, Spencer. Later. Nice
grab food. Oh yeah, Spencer. Later. Nice
to meet you. Have a good one. Yeah. Good
to meet you. Have a good one. Yeah. Good
to be my time. Oh, hey, Viper. That was
to be my time. Oh, hey, Viper. That was
freaking fast. We have a we have a
freaking fast. We have a we have a
graphic designer. Holy, that was super
graphic designer. Holy, that was super
fast. Hey, welcome. So, yeah, the
fast. Hey, welcome. So, yeah, the
project I've got here, it's a short
project I've got here, it's a short
trailer. It's like a 30 second thing.
trailer. It's like a 30 second thing.
Let me let me show you what we've built
Let me let me show you what we've built
here. So, we've got these like 20
here. So, we've got these like 20
environments. Some are games, some are
environments. Some are games, some are
more industry adjacent. We've got like
more industry adjacent. We've got like
this driving sim, but we've also got
this driving sim, but we've also got
like this uh this miniature MMO. We've
like this uh this miniature MMO. We've
got like this MOA. We've got all these
got like this MOA. We've got all these
arcade games. And uh we've built like
arcade games. And uh we've built like
really really fast AI training for this
really really fast AI training for this
stuff and we're trying to find like a
stuff and we're trying to find like a
cool way to convey this to uh a slightly
cool way to convey this to uh a slightly
broader audience. So I have clips for
broader audience. So I have clips for
everything here. I've got all these
everything here. I've got all these
clips, but I'm looking to do something a
clips, but I'm looking to do something a
little more than just like cut them
little more than just like cut them
together with quick transitions, right?
together with quick transitions, right?
So yeah, I want to figure out like a
So yeah, I want to figure out like a
cool way that we can present that. So,
cool way that we can present that. So,
ideally like looking for somebody who's
ideally like looking for somebody who's
done this type of thing, either done
done this type of thing, either done
like YouTube intros for people for like
like YouTube intros for people for like
longer videos or like, you know, kind of
longer videos or like, you know, kind of
has a a good way to like quickly convey
has a a good way to like quickly convey
stuff like this, you know,
and pay whatever the reasonable whatever
and pay whatever the reasonable whatever
reasonable market is for this stuff.
reasonable market is for this stuff.
I'll look up like similar things.
Do you have links to any stuff you've
Do you have links to any stuff you've
done?
Let me start putting these into a Google
Let me start putting these into a Google
Drive as well.
Then
load
If you've got links to like stuff you've
If you've got links to like stuff you've
done and about what you think you'd
done and about what you think you'd
charge for something like this, I'd be
charge for something like this, I'd be
uh very happy to get you started.
I can share the link to this.
These are all like, you know, 10 second
These are all like, you know, 10 second
clips or whatever for the most part.
clips or whatever for the most part.
Probably only using a second or two for
Probably only using a second or two for
each. 25 bucks. Yeah, I'll pay you more
each. 25 bucks. Yeah, I'll pay you more
than that if it's good.
So, I mean, they're just games. It's
So, I mean, they're just games. It's
like they're clips of stuff like this.
like they're clips of stuff like this.
Here, I'll show you. But the the import
Here, I'll show you. But the the import
the important part of it is not that not
the important part of it is not that not
that they're So, we've got like stuff
that they're So, we've got like stuff
like this. We've got stuff like stuff
like this. We've got stuff like stuff
like this. We've got, you know, stuff
like this. We've got, you know, stuff
like uh there's more complex stuff as
like uh there's more complex stuff as
well. stuff like this. But the important
well. stuff like this. But the important
thing here is like we've basically we've
thing here is like we've basically we've
made general purpose training for this
made general purpose training for this
stuff a thousandx faster than it ever
stuff a thousandx faster than it ever
was and so much easier. Like we have all
was and so much easier. Like we have all
these games. They run super fast. We
these games. They run super fast. We
train like these are all models that
train like these are all models that
we've trained on them and they train in
we've trained on them and they train in
like seconds to minutes for the most
like seconds to minutes for the most
part on your local hardware. A few of
part on your local hardware. A few of
them take longer but it's like
them take longer but it's like
ridiculously efficient. So this is like
ridiculously efficient. So this is like
a revolutionary research breakthrough
a revolutionary research breakthrough
more than anything. And I want to convey
more than anything. And I want to convey
it to a slightly larger audience than
it to a slightly larger audience than
normal because like the vast majority of
normal because like the vast majority of
my followers on X are like uh
my followers on X are like uh
reinforcement learning PhDs and
reinforcement learning PhDs and
researchers and people like that. So I'm
researchers and people like that. So I'm
trying to figure out how I can make it
trying to figure out how I can make it
like you know a little bit broader than
like you know a little bit broader than
that.
that.
Let me share the link to this.
Let me share the link to this.
Right. But the import the importance
Right. But the import the importance
Yeah. And I can also I can show you the
Yeah. And I can also I can show you the
trailer that I did last time. So the the
trailer that I did last time. So the the
one that I did for my previous release
one that I did for my previous release
uh was I mean I made it myself so it
uh was I mean I made it myself so it
wasn't very good. Right. So it's this
wasn't very good. Right. So it's this
this is this is what I did for my
this is this is what I did for my
previous release. I kind of just cut
previous release. I kind of just cut
them all together
them all together
and then you'll see the little animation
and then you'll see the little animation
I made at the end which I still have the
I made at the end which I still have the
code for. Like I could include it but
code for. Like I could include it but
I'm looking to do something more than
I'm looking to do something more than
this.
It's the pinned post. Nice. So, how how
It's the pinned post. Nice. So, how how
long did that take you to do? Just I can
long did that take you to do? Just I can
make it better. That took me I mean that
make it better. That took me I mean that
took me a few hours because I don't edit
took me a few hours because I don't edit
videos. Yeah. Yeah. So, just like keep
videos. Yeah. Yeah. So, just like keep
the a like the audience in mind is like
the a like the audience in mind is like
we're trying to get like more industry
we're trying to get like more industry
people involved, you know. Um this is
people involved, you know. Um this is
all free stuff, but we do have a
all free stuff, but we do have a
business side to this and we're looking
business side to this and we're looking
for people in industry who are
for people in industry who are
interested in all the reinforcement
interested in all the reinforcement
learning stuff we do.
learning stuff we do.
[Music]
If you want to get people in industry
If you want to get people in industry
interested, you should do more
interested, you should do more
highlights of like other uses of
highlights of like other uses of
reinforcement learning. We're building
reinforcement learning. We're building
up to that.
up to that.
Like we're building new like the the uh
Like we're building new like the the uh
Terraform sim for instance is
Terraform sim for instance is
specifically to attempt to do stuff with
specifically to attempt to do stuff with
real hardware. Uh the drone sim is as
real hardware. Uh the drone sim is as
well. Like there there's several that
well. Like there there's several that
we're starting on. Um how do I let's see
we're starting on. Um how do I let's see
share this
share this
uh share
anyone.

And I put this in there. That ought to
And I put this in there. That ought to
work for you.
30 seconds. Yep.
30 seconds. Yep.
I can get you more stuff for this. Like
I can get you more stuff for this. Like
I don't know if it makes sense. Like I
I don't know if it makes sense. Like I
like ideally there if you come up with
like ideally there if you come up with
some cool ideas you can it you got it's
some cool ideas you can it you got it's
got to not be something that's going to
got to not be something that's going to
put off like you know industry people or
put off like you know industry people or
whatever. I don't want like some hip-hop
whatever. I don't want like some hip-hop
stuff or I don't want like it's also the
stuff or I don't want like it's also the
licensing of that stuff. There's a lot
licensing of that stuff. There's a lot
like I'd be open let's say I'd be open
like I'd be open let's say I'd be open
to it if we get something that's
to it if we get something that's
tasteful. Um
tasteful. Um
but I think a lot of people just scroll
but I think a lot of people just scroll
do stuff on X muted.
do stuff on X muted.
So here like let me see. So like I don't
So here like let me see. So like I don't
know if we want to do something like
know if we want to do something like
this. Look.
So literally this is how long it takes
So literally this is how long it takes
to uh to train an AI to play Breakout. I
to uh to train an AI to play Breakout. I
literally start this run and within the
literally start this run and within the
30 second trailer it's already done.
30 second trailer it's already done.
Promote some links on it.
Promote some links on it.
Um
Um
here
I can yeah I can show you one sec. So
I can yeah I can show you one sec. So
like literally this has been 23 seconds.
like literally this has been 23 seconds.
Okay. I've just trained this on my
Okay. I've just trained this on my
desktop right here. And then
now I have an AI that can play Breakout
now I have an AI that can play Breakout
like perfectly.
like perfectly.
But I don't know if there's something
But I don't know if there's something
cool we can do where like at the start
cool we can do where like at the start
of it we start training it and we put it
of it we start training it and we put it
up in the corner and then like by the
up in the corner and then like by the
end like it's like hey look this is
end like it's like hey look this is
trained during this is this AI video
trained during this is this AI video
editor this thing here.
editor this thing here.
No.
Do you want me to promote some links? So
Do you want me to promote some links? So
yeah. So it's our stuff is at puffer.ai.
yeah. So it's our stuff is at puffer.ai.
We don't have all the new environments
We don't have all the new environments
uploaded yet but you know we have all
uploaded yet but you know we have all
the ones that I showed you from before.
the ones that I showed you from before.
Um, and then it's this is going to go on
Um, and then it's this is going to go on
my X and on my YouTube as well. So,
my X and on my YouTube as well. So,
stuff will be under there and there.
So, yeah, like for context here, right,
So, yeah, like for context here, right,
I just trained this AI in under 30
I just trained this AI in under 30
seconds. This is something that would
seconds. This is something that would
take hours or like days before this. Um,
so we kind of want to get people excited
so we kind of want to get people excited
about the tech.
about the tech.
I'm a researcher. I work on this stuff
I'm a researcher. I work on this stuff
all the time. We work on this really
all the time. We work on this really
complicated technical stuff and it's
complicated technical stuff and it's
like I want to figure out a way to show
like I want to figure out a way to show
show more people this stuff, right?
And I don't know if I like I want to
And I don't know if I like I want to
make it clear as well that it's not just
make it clear as well that it's not just
games. Like AI has a very long history
games. Like AI has a very long history
of using games for stuff because they
of using games for stuff because they
tend to like they're actually really
tend to like they're actually really
good for developing the tech. But you
good for developing the tech. But you
know, we have more than just games. Like
know, we have more than just games. Like
where's the sim we built?
Like we're actually we're starting to
Like we're actually we're starting to
have much more than just games on this.
have much more than just games on this.
if I can find the uh where did I put it.
if I can find the uh where did I put it.
There.
So, like in here there's also there's
So, like in here there's also there's
this drone sim that I just got submitted
this drone sim that I just got submitted
today. So, this is actually a simulator
today. So, this is actually a simulator
of a drone. We have this terraforming
of a drone. We have this terraforming
end which we're starting to use to like
end which we're starting to use to like
think about how we can train
think about how we can train
uh construction, how we can use
uh construction, how we can use
construction equipment to like terraform
construction equipment to like terraform
an environment. The clip I sent you is
an environment. The clip I sent you is
better. This is like a a weaker model
better. This is like a a weaker model
than the one I sent you, but that's like
than the one I sent you, but that's like
a bulldozer sim. We've got this driving
a bulldozer sim. We've got this driving
sim. We're starting to think about like
sim. We're starting to think about like
autonomous driving stuff. Like there's a
autonomous driving stuff. Like there's a
lot we can do with this.
lot we can do with this.
Yeah, I put the drive link in the chat.
Yeah, I put the drive link in the chat.
I can put it in there again.
And then my DMs here are open on X. Um,
And then my DMs here are open on X. Um,
so just like message me here.
so just like message me here.
We'll get something going.
Uh, hang on. Let me get you the link
Uh, hang on. Let me get you the link
again.
I'll I'll see you guys later. Let me
I'll I'll see you guys later. Let me
know if there's anything further. You
know if there's anything further. You
can DM me or whatever. There you go.
can DM me or whatever. There you go.
There's link.
There's link.
Yeah, let me let me let me DM it to you.
Yeah, let me let me let me DM it to you.
Hang on. I got to figure out how to DM
Hang on. I got to figure out how to DM
you because
you because
uh where's
it? Literally hid your thing for some
it? Literally hid your thing for some
reason. That's silly.
reason. That's silly.
Message
they are.
they are.
That was funny. You literally got this
That was funny. You literally got this
like instantly and hopped in stream like
like instantly and hopped in stream like
to chat. That's awesome.
But I mean it's like it's it's like
But I mean it's like it's it's like
several minutes of clips for like a 30
several minutes of clips for like a 30
second trailer. So the idea is you can
second trailer. So the idea is you can
pick out like a second here, a second
pick out like a second here, a second
there. I mean probably like these
there. I mean probably like these
simpler environments are so simple that
simpler environments are so simple that
you can probably put many of them in the
you can probably put many of them in the
same frame. Um and like maybe the cooler
same frame. Um and like maybe the cooler
ones get full screened. I don't know.
ones get full screened. I don't know.
It's like part most of what I'm doing
It's like part most of what I'm doing
right is I'm looking for somebody to
right is I'm looking for somebody to
come up with like a creative way to clip
come up with like a creative way to clip
this stuff together. Somebody who's had
this stuff together. Somebody who's had
like that creative experience because I
like that creative experience because I
just haven't. I write code all day,
just haven't. I write code all day,
right? I'm a researcher.
That's downloading.
You get a sense of the audience though,
You get a sense of the audience though,
right? It's like mostly professionals,
right? It's like mostly professionals,
maybe hobbyists, right? But like I'm
maybe hobbyists, right? But like I'm
trying to expand a bit around like the
trying to expand a bit around like the
formal researchers, like people in
formal researchers, like people in
industry who are sort of thinking about
industry who are sort of thinking about
AI and maybe looking for cool stuff,
AI and maybe looking for cool stuff,
right? That type of a thing. Yeah. Yeah.
right? That type of a thing. Yeah. Yeah.
This is So this is what I was trying to
This is So this is what I was trying to
get. I was trying to get somebody who
get. I was trying to get somebody who
would sort of listen to this stuff and
would sort of listen to this stuff and
sort of like get a picture of of really
sort of like get a picture of of really
what I'm trying to do here, right?
what I'm trying to do here, right?
Cuz I was like looking on Upwork and
Cuz I was like looking on Upwork and
it's like are they actually going to
it's like are they actually going to
work? Like is somebody going to actually
work? Like is somebody going to actually
work and like take the time to figure
work and like take the time to figure
out like the thing I'm trying to build,
out like the thing I'm trying to build,
right?
It's usually mixed. Like I've gotten
It's usually mixed. Like I've gotten
like really good stuff off of there, but
like really good stuff off of there, but
then I've also gotten just like crap off
then I've also gotten just like crap off
of there.
I mean, I have some ideas, right? Like I
I mean, I have some ideas, right? Like I
said, I It might be a cool thing. And I
said, I It might be a cool thing. And I
could get you a clip of this, right? If
could get you a clip of this, right? If
we think I like I should do
we think I like I should do
Maybe I should just get a clip of this
Maybe I should just get a clip of this
right now.
You record this.
Oh yeah.
See if this works this time. There's
See if this works this time. There's
like a very slight variance to it.
This seems like it works though.
So, let me put that in the drive view as
So, let me put that in the drive view as
well.
I don't know if there's something where
I don't know if there's something where
it's like you can like just show this at
it's like you can like just show this at
the start and like put it up in the
the start and like put it up in the
corner and then it comes back and by the
corner and then it comes back and by the
end it's trained. Um,
if you want other assets from me, like
if you want other assets from me, like
let me know as well. If you like think
let me know as well. If you like think
of like, oh, it would be cool if you had
of like, oh, it would be cool if you had
something that did this or that.
That bot.
That bot.
Oh.
Okay.
Pretty well. It I know. I also have I
Pretty well. It I know. I also have I
also have all sorts of graphs. I don't
also have all sorts of graphs. I don't
know if any of these are useful.
know if any of these are useful.
Like this is a pretty crazy graph. It's
Like this is a pretty crazy graph. It's
just a line. But the thing is this
just a line. But the thing is this
X-axis, this is this is basically a
X-axis, this is this is basically a
model that has played the g like this is
model that has played the g like this is
the MMO game, the one with like the
the MMO game, the one with like the
slashing and the bows and stuff pixel
slashing and the bows and stuff pixel
art. So this thing has played this game
art. So this thing has played this game
for like literally 10,000 years in this
for like literally 10,000 years in this
graph. It's still running. Um it's going
graph. It's still running. Um it's going
to play the game for 20,000 years before
to play the game for 20,000 years before
it's done fully. But like yeah, this
it's done fully. But like yeah, this
thing it literally like it's running
thing it literally like it's running
like simulation at 10,000 times plus
like simulation at 10,000 times plus
real time.
real time.
Oh, of course.
I'm going to go to bed in a in a few and
I'm going to go to bed in a in a few and
then probably check back in the morning
then probably check back in the morning
if that sounds good.
Quick question for you before you go,
Quick question for you before you go,
Joseph, if that's all right. Um, so I'm
Joseph, if that's all right. Um, so I'm
I've I've looked over the math. Um, I'm

that's about it for today.
Get myself

You know,
it's not like we only implemented it for

when I made it was that this was going

just DM you this. Uh just so you know,
the shift pressing shift crashes it. So
the shift pressing shift crashes it. So

Also, I think I don't know if Spencer
Also, I think I don't know if Spencer
fixed it or not, but the whatever the
fixed it or not, but the whatever the
hell you did broke tower climb training.
hell you did broke tower climb training.
Yeah, train training, you know, may may
Yeah, train training, you know, may may
or may not have worked. That was just a

fancy fancy looking render. You're
fancy fancy looking render. You're
supposed to not break training in the

[ __ ] I I already I already spent all
[ __ ] I I already I already spent all
night all all morning and all all night
night all all morning and all all night
on that
on that
an operate training again. Well,
an operate training again. Well,
so the thing is you can you could render
so the thing is you can you could render
the you could render it the same because
the you could render it the same because
I didn't change anything that matters,
I didn't change anything that matters,
right? It's just shiny here.
Spencer power climb trains
like like like
like like like
that's I changed the rendering function
that's I changed the rendering function
only so it shouldn't not that's weird
only so it shouldn't not that's weird
something happened then. Well yeah we
something happened then. Well yeah we
have ants to discuss though. Yep. By all
have ants to discuss though. Yep. By all
means.
means.
Yeah. So, um, basically what I've done
Yeah. So, um, basically what I've done
is I've simplified the ant simulator
is I've simplified the ant simulator
pretty significantly
pretty significantly
by, um, making the movements much wider.
by, um, making the movements much wider.
So, um, I had this suspicion that the
So, um, I had this suspicion that the
action space was too wide where it was
action space was too wide where it was
like able to turn on a single degree um,
like able to turn on a single degree um,
not have that much change. So, I made it
not have that much change. So, I made it
change turn 90 degrees every time it
change turn 90 degrees every time it
turns. And that led to this behavior
turns. And that led to this behavior
where the reward function will spike
where the reward function will spike
early on and then fall back down for
early on and then fall back down for
whatever reason. Um, and so I'm trying
whatever reason. Um, and so I'm trying
to figure out how to prevent it from
to figure out how to prevent it from
falling back down or what's causing
falling back down or what's causing
that. I looked at uh the food
that. I looked at uh the food
respawning. Um, so originally there was
respawning. Um, so originally there was
no respawn for the food when they have
no respawn for the food when they have
fully consumed a food source. And so I
fully consumed a food source. And so I
think that was leading to like this late
think that was leading to like this late
crash in the training that I um have
crash in the training that I um have
since fixed. But now there's like this
since fixed. But now there's like this
spike behavior at the beginning that I'm
spike behavior at the beginning that I'm
trying to figure out. Um
trying to figure out. Um
I can show you guys what I'm talking
I can show you guys what I'm talking
about. Second.
about. Second.
Yeah. I'm also at the same time I'm
Yeah. I'm also at the same time I'm
recording all the clips of all these
recording all the clips of all these
ends for uh for the release. The idea is
ends for uh for the release. The idea is
that we have like 25 of these. I'm gonna
that we have like 25 of these. I'm gonna
get clips for all of them and then find
get clips for all of them and then find
myself an editor. Yeah, just go ahead
myself an editor. Yeah, just go ahead
and show me this the end whenever you
and show me this the end whenever you
want.
want.
Yeah. So, um I'll show you the latest
Yeah. So, um I'll show you the latest
Neptune run.
Neptune run.
And this spike has been happening
And this spike has been happening
predictably whenever I do a training run
predictably whenever I do a training run
where the reward will spike up, the
where the reward will spike up, the
score will spike up, and then it will
score will spike up, and then it will
fall back down and then just kind of
fall back down and then just kind of
stay down for the rest of the run. Yeah.
stay down for the rest of the run. Yeah.
So that kind of implies that you get
So that kind of implies that you get
some reward at the start just by acting
some reward at the start just by acting
randomly and then the end dynamics
randomly and then the end dynamics
change or similar.
change or similar.
It's probably just that there's a bunch
It's probably just that there's a bunch
of food around at the start and it is
of food around at the start and it is
not respawning in a reasonable way.
not respawning in a reasonable way.
Yeah. So I've tried uh doing this step
Yeah. So I've tried uh doing this step
where um let me have you rendered it?
where um let me have you rendered it?
Repo's open. I have. Yeah. So, there is
Repo's open. I have. Yeah. So, there is
a minimum distance from the starter
a minimum distance from the starter
colony for food to arrive. And I've done
colony for food to arrive. And I've done
a run where I literally just increase
a run where I literally just increase
that distance threefold. And the same
that distance threefold. And the same
spike behavior is still visible. So, I
spike behavior is still visible. So, I
don't think it has anything to do with
don't think it has anything to do with
the uh distance from the colony. This
the uh distance from the colony. This
used to be 100 here. Um
used to be 100 here. Um
but basically um I changed the um turn
but basically um I changed the um turn
radius to pi over two. So uh only four
radius to pi over two. So uh only four
different directions it can go. And I
different directions it can go. And I
added an observation where um it has the
added an observation where um it has the
current direction normalized between
current direction normalized between
zero and one. Um so this will always be
zero and one. Um so this will always be
one of these four values.
one of these four values.
Um, and otherwise the these are the
Um, and otherwise the these are the
same. So it still has the distance
same. So it still has the distance
squared from the ant to the colony uh as
squared from the ant to the colony uh as
well as the distance squared from the
well as the distance squared from the
ant to the food. Um, and I've changed uh
ant to the food. Um, and I've changed uh
is in vision to always return true. So
is in vision to always return true. So
um, their range of sight is essentially
um, their range of sight is essentially
infinite right now.
infinite right now.
Is it playable? Does it change? Yeah.
Is it playable? Does it change? Yeah.
Let's see. Can you play it and like get
Let's see. Can you play it and like get
food and that all works?
food and that all works?
Yeah. So, I can This is them moving
Yeah. So, I can This is them moving
randomly. Um, if I hit shift, they all
randomly. Um, if I hit shift, they all
uh perform the way I've uh scripted them
uh perform the way I've uh scripted them
to perform. You can see they're able to
to perform. You can see they're able to
get food, bring it back uh with no
get food, bring it back uh with no
issue. Um,
issue. Um,
so this all works. This is with the um
so this all works. This is with the um
movements
movements
um sort of prescripted. That's like
um sort of prescripted. That's like
That's like 300 ticks to like get the
That's like 300 ticks to like get the
food and bring it back.
food and bring it back.
Yeah. Uh yeah. So you're saying if I
Yeah. Uh yeah. So you're saying if I
were to leave it randomly, how many
were to leave it randomly, how many
ticks would it take for them to get
ticks would it take for them to get
food? Like that's like a ridiculously
food? Like that's like a ridiculously
deep exploration problem at the moment.
deep exploration problem at the moment.
Like 300 time steps is like a really
Like 300 time steps is like a really
long credit assignment problem.
The time is not perceived continuously,
The time is not perceived continuously,
right? Like if you just make the frame
right? Like if you just make the frame
rate, if they move at the same speed in
rate, if they move at the same speed in
real time, you just make it like a
real time, you just make it like a
thousand frames, like a thousand frames
thousand frames, like a thousand frames
for each of these movements or whatever,
for each of these movements or whatever,
you break all learning like pure
you break all learning like pure
algorithmically because you need to get
algorithmically because you need to get
reward signal in order for credit
reward signal in order for credit
assignment to occur. These ants are are
assignment to occur. These ants are are
lost it looks like. Yeah, these they
lost it looks like. Yeah, these they
don't pursue
don't pursue
randomly.
randomly.
Oh, what about the trained? Yeah. So,
Oh, what about the trained? Yeah. So,
it's literally it takes them it's going
it's literally it takes them it's going
to take them like 10,000 ticks to get
to take them like 10,000 ticks to get
anything.
Yeah. So, um it will take at least 300
Yeah. So, um it will take at least 300
for them or 100. What happens if you 10x
for them or 100. What happens if you 10x
the speed their speed? Yeah. Yeah. So,
the speed their speed? Yeah. Yeah. So,
we can do that. Get a get a nightmare
we can do that. Get a get a nightmare
scenario.
scenario.
Um, man. You know what I did? Let's see.
Um, man. You know what I did? Let's see.
I woke up on farm, found a cockroach,
I woke up on farm, found a cockroach,
even though there's literally no food in
even though there's literally no food in
here, and then I went for a run, nearly
here, and then I went for a run, nearly
stepped on a snapping turtle, nearly
stepped on a snapping turtle, nearly
stepped on a snake, came back, took a
stepped on a snake, came back, took a
shower, went to dry my uh to dry myself,
shower, went to dry my uh to dry myself,
and I had like some big brown spider
and I had like some big brown spider
jump off the towel onto the back of my
jump off the towel onto the back of my
neck, and I had to like grab it off of
neck, and I had to like grab it off of
there. You [ __ ] thing. I was more I
there. You [ __ ] thing. I was more I
was more pissed about the snake though.
was more pissed about the snake though.
Spider won't kill you. Oh, the snake.
Spider won't kill you. Oh, the snake.
There aren't no There are not deadly
There aren't no There are not deadly
snakes there. We have copperheads and
snakes there. We have copperheads and
water moccasins. They will absolutely
water moccasins. They will absolutely
kill you. Yeah, copperheads are [ __ ]
kill you. Yeah, copperheads are [ __ ]
Yeah. And uh you're not getting to the
Yeah. And uh you're not getting to the
hospital in time around here. And they
hospital in time around here. And they
probably don't have them. Is this is
probably don't have them. Is this is
this 10x speed? Did you recompile?
this 10x speed? Did you recompile?
No. So, this is uh the eval uh this is
No. So, this is uh the eval uh this is
the most recent training run trained
the most recent training run trained
after you change the I mean um so you
after you change the I mean um so you
can see we've already gotten to like
can see we've already gotten to like
2500 ticks and they haven't been able to
2500 ticks and they haven't been able to
bring any food back. Yeah, because it's
bring any food back. Yeah, because it's
freaking it's like it takes too many
freaking it's like it takes too many
ticks to do anything in this game. It's
ticks to do anything in this game. It's
extremely difficult for them to get to
extremely difficult for them to get to
food. Okay, so let's uh try think of
food. Okay, so let's uh try think of
think of one tick equals 1 second.
think of one tick equals 1 second.
That's like a better analogy for like
That's like a better analogy for like
how the RL agent sees things. All right.
how the RL agent sees things. All right.
So you basically it takes five minutes
So you basically it takes five minutes
to do anything. And there's a there's a
to do anything. And there's a there's a
there's like a there's a horizon too
there's like a there's a horizon too
with with respect to the the policy
with with respect to the the policy
seeing what's happened certain number of
seeing what's happened certain number of
steps ago. So
steps ago. So
it doesn't just know the agent just
it doesn't just know the agent just
thinks so much faster than you that
thinks so much faster than you that
after a few hundred frames, it's only
after a few hundred frames, it's only
been a few a few seconds for you, but

it's been like several minutes to them
it's been like several minutes to them

Well, yeah, it's it's getting no not

That's
You sent me a command, Dan, to uh
You sent me a command, Dan, to uh
rebuild. It's been a long time since I
rebuild. It's been a long time since I
ran it. So, it's uh build ocean. Search
ran it. So, it's uh build ocean. Search
for ocean. Oh, no. I have the build
for ocean. Oh, no. I have the build
ocean command. Um I'm looking for the
ocean command. Um I'm looking for the
Python. Looking for the full compile.
Python. Looking for the full compile.
Then you want uh it's going to be
Then you want uh it's going to be

Holy terraforming Spencer.
What's it going to be? Trying to I'm
What's it going to be? Trying to I'm
trying to remember. No, let me pull it.
trying to remember. No, let me pull it.
I gotta pull
I gotta pull
pull my thing up. I have to be be in the
pull my thing up. I have to be be in the

it's uh just uh my credit assignment for
it's uh just uh my credit assignment for
Terra is 1020. It's pip. It's not pip.
Terra is 1020. It's pip. It's not pip.
It's a Python setup. What do you mean
It's a Python setup. What do you mean
your credit assignment is 1024, Spencer?
You gota be You're trolling if it is.
You gota be You're trolling if it is.
There you go. That one. I know. I know
There you go. That one. I know. I know
it isn't because I set up the time the
it isn't because I set up the time the

Yeah, that's not what credit credit
Yeah, that's not what credit credit
assignment not equal episode length.
assignment not equal episode length.
That's not how that works.
Oh, uh question for how I can think
Oh, uh question for how I can think
about this um as I'm I'm writing this
about this um as I'm I'm writing this
out. So, um, right now the ants, um,
out. So, um, right now the ants, um,
find.
find.
Yeah. So, I'm giving them a very simple
Yeah. So, I'm giving them a very simple
reward, which is just, um, one reward
reward, which is just, um, one reward
for picking up food and a big reward of
for picking up food and a big reward of
50 for bringing it all the way back to
50 for bringing it all the way back to
the car. That's the same thing as giving
the car. That's the same thing as giving
them one for each. It's going to clip to
them one for each. It's going to clip to
one anyways.
Okay. So the magnitude of reward isn't
Okay. So the magnitude of reward isn't
that relevant. It is very relevant. It's
that relevant. It is very relevant. It's
just that we we clip rewards between
just that we we clip rewards between
negative one and one precisely to
negative one and one precisely to
prevent people from crashing learning by
prevent people from crashing learning by
doing that because if you give it 50,
doing that because if you give it 50,
you'll just break you'll break the RL
you'll just break you'll break the RL
because you'll have massive gradients
because you'll have massive gradients
and you'll just like nan everything.
and you'll just like nan everything.
Okay. Yeah, I see. So in the ants.py pi
Okay. Yeah, I see. So in the ants.py pi
I've got these um action spaces and
I've got these um action spaces and
observation spaces. Um
observation spaces. Um
the action spaces between or sorry
the action spaces between or sorry
observation space is between zero and
observation space is between zero and
one right. Um last time we mentioned
one right. Um last time we mentioned
that uh if they have something that's
that uh if they have something that's
outside their range of sight we should
outside their range of sight we should
have the thing being given as minus one.
have the thing being given as minus one.
Will that be ignored or will it be
Will that be ignored or will it be
treated as zero or should I be changing
treated as zero or should I be changing
the lower bound here?
the lower bound here?
Should probably change the lower bound,
Should probably change the lower bound,
but I'll be surprised if that does
but I'll be surprised if that does
anything.
anything.
Okay. Yeah, this part where um if in
Okay. Yeah, this part where um if in
this case it's irrelevant because there
this case it's irrelevant because there
will always be food and there uh the
will always be food and there uh the
vision will always return true. But for
vision will always return true. But for
when there's limited vision, we were
when there's limited vision, we were
going to set these observations to be
going to set these observations to be
negative one. Um, fine.
negative one. Um, fine.
So, would that be treated as zero in
So, would that be treated as zero in
here? Would that How would that uh No,
here? Would that How would that uh No,
it probably just gets treated as
it probably just gets treated as
negative one. I don't think we actually
negative one. I don't think we actually
enforce the OBS bounds for um for puffer
enforce the OBS bounds for um for puffer
ends, native ms. You're kind of going on
ends, native ms. You're kind of going on
expert mode. We probably should, but
expert mode. We probably should, but
yeah, you should just change that bound
yeah, you should just change that bound
to be a negative oneative one to one.
Cool. And then um
Cool. And then um
let me think. Yes. Uh the other thing I
let me think. Yes. Uh the other thing I
was thinking about was
was thinking about was
um
um
the observation size. So um right now
the observation size. So um right now
it is eight different things. That's um
it is eight different things. That's um
okay. If this uh changes, is that what
okay. If this uh changes, is that what
this shape corresponds to? Yes. is the
this shape corresponds to? Yes. is the
number of ops that you have per agent.
number of ops that you have per agent.
Okay. Yeah. And then for the things that
Okay. Yeah. And then for the things that
are being logged like score, is this the
are being logged like score, is this the
average across all the agents for that
average across all the agents for that
particular epoch or how can I interpret
particular epoch or how can I interpret
these log except except that you you're
these log except except that you you're
responsible for doing that manually? So
responsible for doing that manually? So
every time you add something to the logs
every time you add something to the logs
and you increment n like you're gonna
and you increment n like you're gonna
the thing it's just going to take
the thing it's just going to take
literally all it does is it takes
literally all it does is it takes
everything in log and then it divide
everything in log and then it divide
divides by that n.
You see?
You see?
So if you log at the end of every like
So if you log at the end of every like
whenever an agent dies if you log your
whenever an agent dies if you log your
score then you increment n by one then
score then you increment n by one then
it's going to be the average over agent
it's going to be the average over agent
lifetimes.
lifetimes.
If you just like wait 300 steps, right,
If you just like wait 300 steps, right,
and then you log once everything at the
and then you log once everything at the
end of 300 steps, then it's going to be
end of 300 steps, then it's going to be
the average, you know, the average
the average, you know, the average
result over segments of 300 steps. It
result over segments of 300 steps. It
depends on how you do it.
depends on how you do it.
Basically, all we do, right, is we set
Basically, all we do, right, is we set
up the average for you.
up the average for you.
So, yeah. So, in here, uh, when I have
So, yeah. So, in here, uh, when I have
the terminal condition, uh, and I'm
the terminal condition, uh, and I'm
incrementing n, that's going to be the
incrementing n, that's going to be the
way that this gets divided off. Yep. By
way that this gets divided off. Yep. By
the way, there n equals one is saying
the way, there n equals one is saying
that this thing is averaging over one
that this thing is averaging over one
sample only. You're probably like
sample only. You're probably like
reporting very very frequently or
reporting very very frequently or
something.
something.
Yeah, it seems like the score has
Yeah, it seems like the score has
dropped to zero and staying there for
dropped to zero and staying there for
some reason too. You recompile with the
some reason too. You recompile with the
um the with the increased speed. Yeah,
um the with the increased speed. Yeah,
interesting.
I mean getting actual zero score. It's
I mean getting actual zero score. It's
like I you always got to check if
like I you always got to check if
something went wrong with the end as
something went wrong with the end as
well.
The food is supposed to grow back,
The food is supposed to grow back,
right? It is. Yeah. So, as soon as food
right? It is. Yeah. So, as soon as food
uh gets there's like a hundred units of
uh gets there's like a hundred units of
food in one of those green circles. As
food in one of those green circles. As
soon as one of the green circles
soon as one of the green circles
disappears, a new one appears somewhere
disappears, a new one appears somewhere
else on the map. Equally far from the

original colony. Well, I mean, see
original colony. Well, I mean, see
what's happening. At least now stuff
what's happening. At least now stuff
should be faster.
Yeah, let me make sure that something's
Yeah, let me make sure that something's
been saved.
been saved.
I mean, there are a number of different
I mean, there are a number of different
ways that we do this. Um, like
ways that we do this. Um, like
technically the best way to do it is
technically the best way to do it is
uh we like smooth the frame rate or
uh we like smooth the frame rate or
whatever. So,
like basically it won't be running super
like basically it won't be running super
fast but it'll still be smooth. Um I
fast but it'll still be smooth. Um I
don't know like probably good to look at
don't know like probably good to look at
for how we do that. Maybe ourware
for how we do that. Maybe ourware
ourware is a good example of that but
ourware is a good example of that but
doesn't make a huge difference. It's
doesn't make a huge difference. It's
just going to render kind of fast as
just going to render kind of fast as
well.
Yeah. So they're running very fast and
Yeah. So they're running very fast and
they're leaving pherommones behind very
they're leaving pherommones behind very
fast.
fast.
Um, something looks wrong.
Um, something looks wrong.
Why are there pherommones everywhere and
Why are there pherommones everywhere and
why are they evenly spaced?
why are they evenly spaced?
Yeah, I'm wondering the same thing here.
Yeah, I'm wondering the same thing here.
Isn't it Is the movement continuous?
Isn't it Is the movement continuous?
Um, yeah. So, the the movement is going
Um, yeah. So, the the movement is going
to be um continuous in one direction
to be um continuous in one direction
until they turn. So, what is the action
until they turn. So, what is the action
space? It's like move and turn or
space? It's like move and turn or
something. It's turn left and turn
something. It's turn left and turn
right. By drop
right. By drop
uh by 90 degrees. Oh, well that's why
uh by 90 degrees. Oh, well that's why
they they're on a grid. It's they can
they they're on a grid. It's they can
only move on a grid.
Yeah, they um I'm more so thinking
Yeah, they um I'm more so thinking
wouldn't they uh turn at different
wouldn't they uh turn at different
times? But they do seem to do that. Like
times? But they do seem to do that. Like
the grid isn't perfectly um gridlike.
Yeah, this is uh be getting any food at
Yeah, this is uh be getting any food at
all. No, this is looks like random
all. No, this is looks like random
movement to me. Yeah, it looks like
movement to me. Yeah, it looks like
random movement that's been accelerated.
But okay, I'm I'm curious. Um, what can
But okay, I'm I'm curious. Um, what can
you tell me about um you mentioned
you tell me about um you mentioned
there's like too much in-game time
there's like too much in-game time
taking place between rewards, right?
taking place between rewards, right?
Um so one of the solutions I had to that
Um so one of the solutions I had to that
was uh implementing a reward where um I
was uh implementing a reward where um I
have like a small positive reward for
have like a small positive reward for
heading towards visible food. Um I was
heading towards visible food. Um I was
doing like this as my reward for every
doing like this as my reward for every
time step that the angle difference is
time step that the angle difference is
less than the turn angle. You can try
less than the turn angle. You can try
that type of a thing and like that can
that type of a thing and like that can
work. It's better just to like the thing
work. It's better just to like the thing
is making them faster is equivalent to
is making them faster is equivalent to
uh applying like a frame skip. Another
uh applying like a frame skip. Another
common technique. Look, the problem here
common technique. Look, the problem here
is right like you have this temporal
is right like you have this temporal
hierarchy thing baked into you where you
hierarchy thing baked into you where you
don't experience time in plank seconds,
don't experience time in plank seconds,
right? Like it you don't experience like
right? Like it you don't experience like
each frame as it comes like you
each frame as it comes like you
experience this time continuum where a
experience this time continuum where a
second feels like a relatively short
second feels like a relatively short
amount of time despite you actually
amount of time despite you actually
being able to uh see like you're being
being able to uh see like you're being
able to process stuff substantially
able to process stuff substantially
faster than that. Um the agent on the
faster than that. Um the agent on the
other hand doesn't have that. They get
other hand doesn't have that. They get
this like these discrete time steps,
this like these discrete time steps,
right? Where they kind of expect
right? Where they kind of expect
something to happen and there to be
something to happen and there to be
cause effect over that time frame. So
cause effect over that time frame. So
unless you want to get into fancier
unless you want to get into fancier
architecture research, um that's kind of
architecture research, um that's kind of
just a thing you have to deal with. And
just a thing you have to deal with. And
the easiest way to deal with that is to
the easiest way to deal with that is to
try to make sure that at least simpler
try to make sure that at least simpler
environments have rewards that are
environments have rewards that are
accessible within tens of steps. In more
accessible within tens of steps. In more
complex ones, maybe it's within
complex ones, maybe it's within
hundreds, but then like then we start
hundreds, but then like then we start
doing more sophisticated stuff than
doing more sophisticated stuff than
you're doing here to make that work.
you're doing here to make that work.
Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. So
Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. So
what if we reduced the minimum distance
what if we reduced the minimum distance
to
to
and then back to something reasonable
and then back to something reasonable
size of a food source to something like
size of a food source to something like
20, right? So then and also make them
20, right? So then and also make them
move at a reasonable speed because I
move at a reasonable speed because I
think they're overshooting the food at
think they're overshooting the food at
the moment. Like they just can't get to
the moment. Like they just can't get to
it, right? Um I think
it, right? Um I think
I mean you don't have to train this. You
I mean you don't have to train this. You
just have to like Load it up in uh load

That way we can compare
that it's compare remote control

super jerryrigged policy to make that
super jerryrigged policy to make that
work. Well, sure. You know, it's just
work. Well, sure. You know, it's just
basically a demo, right? Yeah.
basically a demo, right? Yeah.
But I'm talking longer term. That was uh
But I'm talking longer term. That was uh
my first attempt at uh curriculum
my first attempt at uh curriculum
learning.
learning.
That was
That was
of the smallest degree. Yeah. Because
of the smallest degree. Yeah. Because
the terraforming problem becomes harder
the terraforming problem becomes harder
as you solve it. Um because more dirt is
as you solve it. Um because more dirt is
in the right place and dirt you need to
in the right place and dirt you need to
grab from is in potentially further away
grab from is in potentially further away
places. That makes sense. Um so you have
places. That makes sense. Um so you have
to explore more to get probably less
to explore more to get probably less

But did you didn't use curriculum
But did you didn't use curriculum
learning though, did you?
learning though, did you?
Um, I did one task that got it up to

only solve maps that start at 70%

end up doing multiple dozers because

like
it's a similar issue where if you want
it's a similar issue where if you want
to get things to cooperate, you have to
to get things to cooperate, you have to
kind of do a bunch of other stuff
or you know just reward it, right? You

have to tune the
Yeah, I'm thinking if we want them to um
Yeah, I'm thinking if we want them to um
in the case of the ants emerge the

collaborative use of pherommones
collaborative use of pherommones
um I think they it's something that they
um I think they it's something that they
need to naturally figure out for
need to naturally figure out for
themselves. So I feel like hard coding
themselves. So I feel like hard coding
reward functions to get them to
reward functions to get them to
collaborate is one thing. Um, but if you
collaborate is one thing. Um, but if you
can kind of make the reward function
can kind of make the reward function
general enough, they can start to just
general enough, they can start to just
realize like, hey, we can work faster if
realize like, hey, we can work faster if
we do it this way. And if they're all on
we do it this way. And if they're all on
the same policy, then there's no reason
the same policy, then there's no reason
for them not to emerge that kind of
for them not to emerge that kind of

I do think a general reward structure
I do think a general reward structure
can work. It just makes it you have to
can work. It just makes it you have to
train it, I think, for like way way way
train it, I think, for like way way way
way longer because I ran into things
way longer because I ran into things
when I was doing this with dozers when I
when I was doing this with dozers when I
was doing multiple on on the demo. was
was doing multiple on on the demo. was
doing single so I could easily solve
doing single so I could easily solve
because I gave up a multiple for the

each other for resources

and then also in the environment before
and then also in the environment before
I was like splitting them up into
I was like splitting them up into
quadrants for them to solve and then say
quadrants for them to solve and then say
there's two neighboring quadrants they
there's two neighboring quadrants they
would steal each other's dirt as well.
would steal each other's dirt as well.
Interesting. And so I would create like
Interesting. And so I would create like
penalties to do like so like don't like

screw up with things that are done.
screw up with things that are done.
don't like take things from your
don't like take things from your
neighbors and stuff like that. And that
neighbors and stuff like that. And that
actually that worked. Um,
actually that worked. Um,
but it didn't necessarily make them
but it didn't necessarily make them
cooperate. It just made them like not
cooperate. It just made them like not
try to ruin each other like
try to ruin each other like
independently solve.
independently solve.
Yeah, that's interesting. It's like a
Yeah, that's interesting. It's like a
mini society. You got to enforce
mini society. You got to enforce
punishments when it comes to bad
punishments when it comes to bad

But I do think you could probably get
But I do think you could probably get
away with it without any penalties on
away with it without any penalties on
that degree.
that degree.
um if you did like a proper shared
um if you did like a proper shared
reward and maybe some degree of like

independent
independent
two um team rewards that you would kneel
two um team rewards that you would kneel
over.
over.
So were these uh dozers on different
So were these uh dozers on different
teams in some way in the policy? Um, no.
teams in some way in the policy? Um, no.
I guess what I mean by is like in the
I guess what I mean by is like in the
beginning you focus on the individual
beginning you focus on the individual
rewards so that it can like learn the
rewards so that it can like learn the
mechanics of what it's even doing and
mechanics of what it's even doing and
then over time you weight them less and
then over time you weight them less and
then you weight the team rewards higher.
then you weight the team rewards higher.
Yeah,
Yeah,
because in the end of the day the whole
because in the end of the day the whole
thing is one team. Like in in this
thing is one team. Like in in this
problem there's not multiple teams. Is
problem there's not multiple teams. Is
it just like as many dozers on the map
it just like as many dozers on the map
working together
working together
to get the map to to get it like 100%
to get the map to to get it like 100%
from original dirt, whatever your
from original dirt, whatever your
original topology is um to your target.
Yeah. I mean, I think um you're probably
Yeah. I mean, I think um you're probably
right that we're going to run into
right that we're going to run into
similar things. Like I'm still on the
similar things. Like I'm still on the
part of trying to get them to even
part of trying to get them to even
figure out the mechanics of what they're
figure out the mechanics of what they're
doing.
doing.
But I think
But I think
once it's there, it should be an
once it's there, it should be an
interesting problem to see um how to get
interesting problem to see um how to get
them to collaborate or what their
them to collaborate or what their
propensity is or is not to collaborate

given the reports.
given the reports.
Um, I wonder if there's some kind of
Um, I wonder if there's some kind of
function that you can show like um you
function that you can show like um you
define certain um non-colaborative or
define certain um non-colaborative or
collaborative behaviors
collaborative behaviors
um in a way that's like easy to verify.
um in a way that's like easy to verify.
Um and then you
Um and then you
tune the reward function up one way or
tune the reward function up one way or
another if there's some kind of
another if there's some kind of
relationship between those variables
relationship between those variables
that you can show.
that you can show.
There's probably something in that in
There's probably something in that in
that realm with what you just said that
that realm with what you just said that
works. Um I think it just comes down to
works. Um I think it just comes down to
how you're going to define that. And I
how you're going to define that. And I
think you just define it through your

Yeah. I mean I think also there's a way
Yeah. I mean I think also there's a way
to think about it in the in the case of
to think about it in the in the case of
the ants. It's like pherommones, right?
the ants. It's like pherommones, right?
We want them to use pherommones to
We want them to use pherommones to
communicate with each other. So the more
communicate with each other. So the more
highly weighted
highly weighted
the pheromone sense is to actual end
the pheromone sense is to actual end
behaviors, the more they've learned to
behaviors, the more they've learned to
use pherommones in a way that's actually
use pherommones in a way that's actually
productive, right?
productive, right?
I guess it comes down to with that like
I guess it comes down to with that like
concept, right? Where you're using
concept, right? Where you're using
pherommones
pherommones
under the assumption that like ants
under the assumption that like ants
leave pherommones behind and therefore
leave pherommones behind and therefore
another ant has to use it. Um,
how are you going to tie that together
how are you going to tie that together
though?
though?
Like at the future state, you know what
Like at the future state, you know what
I mean? Like say you get your food, but
I mean? Like say you get your food, but
like how are you going to tie that to
like how are you going to tie that to
the fact that you did use the pheromone
the fact that you did use the pheromone
of ant A or B? Are you just going to
of ant A or B? Are you just going to
have like a path? Are you going to like
have like a path? Are you going to like
constantly recalculate paths and if they
constantly recalculate paths and if they
intersected or something? I'm looking
intersected or something? I'm looking
for something that's not just like paste
for something that's not just like paste
all the clips together. I'm looking to
all the clips together. I'm looking to
see if I can find somebody that come
see if I can find somebody that come
will come up with a creative way to like
will come up with a creative way to like
convey what we've built using these
convey what we've built using these
clips plus whatever else. And uh yeah,
clips plus whatever else. And uh yeah,
I'm looking ideally to like convey what
I'm looking ideally to like convey what
we've built to a slightly wider
we've built to a slightly wider
audience. I'm going to be paying
audience. I'm going to be paying
somebody. That'll be taking a lot of
somebody. That'll be taking a lot of
work. The 30 second trailer, we'll pay a
work. The 30 second trailer, we'll pay a
few hundred bucks for it.
few hundred bucks for it.
Like I could line them all up pretty
Like I could line them all up pretty
easily, but uh yeah, I can I mean I'm
easily, but uh yeah, I can I mean I'm
looking for somebody who's done this
looking for somebody who's done this
type of stuff and play them and um I
type of stuff and play them and um I
don't know what they charge for this. I
don't know what they charge for this. I
think it's probably like a few hundred
think it's probably like a few hundred
bucks.
It's it's worth it's worth it for sure
It's it's worth it's worth it for sure
to to have someone I mean I like the
to to have someone I mean I like the
goal is that we get something something
goal is that we get something something
that's going to get us like you know uh
that's going to get us like you know uh
like a thousand like you know 100k views
like a thousand like you know 100k views
or whatever thousand likes like actually
or whatever thousand likes like actually
have like a big post for the release.
I'm trying to like find basically like
I'm trying to like find basically like
if they can double the engagement that
if they can double the engagement that
we'd expect that's good value
we'd expect that's good value
for sure.
for sure.
Yeah, for this release like this is the
Yeah, for this release like this is the
one we want people to see.
This is funny.
All right, I'm going to head out and
All right, I'm going to head out and
grab food. Oh yeah, Spencer. Later. Nice
grab food. Oh yeah, Spencer. Later. Nice
to meet you. Have a good one. Yeah. Good
to meet you. Have a good one. Yeah. Good
to be my time. Oh, hey, Viper. That was
to be my time. Oh, hey, Viper. That was
freaking fast. We have a we have a
freaking fast. We have a we have a
graphic designer. Holy, that was super
graphic designer. Holy, that was super
fast. Hey, welcome. So, yeah, the
fast. Hey, welcome. So, yeah, the
project I've got here, it's a short
project I've got here, it's a short
trailer. It's like a 30 second thing.
trailer. It's like a 30 second thing.
Let me let me show you what we've built
Let me let me show you what we've built
here. So, we've got these like 20
here. So, we've got these like 20
environments. Some are games, some are
environments. Some are games, some are
more industry adjacent. We've got like
more industry adjacent. We've got like
this driving sim, but we've also got
this driving sim, but we've also got
like this uh this miniature MMO. We've
like this uh this miniature MMO. We've
got like this MOA. We've got all these
got like this MOA. We've got all these
arcade games. And uh we've built like
arcade games. And uh we've built like
really really fast AI training for this
really really fast AI training for this
stuff and we're trying to find like a
stuff and we're trying to find like a
cool way to convey this to uh a slightly
cool way to convey this to uh a slightly
broader audience. So I have clips for
broader audience. So I have clips for
everything here. I've got all these
everything here. I've got all these
clips, but I'm looking to do something a
clips, but I'm looking to do something a
little more than just like cut them
little more than just like cut them
together with quick transitions, right?
together with quick transitions, right?
So yeah, I want to figure out like a
So yeah, I want to figure out like a
cool way that we can present that. So,
cool way that we can present that. So,
ideally like looking for somebody who's
ideally like looking for somebody who's
done this type of thing, either done
done this type of thing, either done
like YouTube intros for people for like
like YouTube intros for people for like
longer videos or like, you know, kind of
longer videos or like, you know, kind of
has a a good way to like quickly convey
has a a good way to like quickly convey
stuff like this, you know,
and pay whatever the reasonable whatever
and pay whatever the reasonable whatever
reasonable market is for this stuff.
reasonable market is for this stuff.
I'll look up like similar things.
Do you have links to any stuff you've
Do you have links to any stuff you've
done?
Let me start putting these into a Google
Let me start putting these into a Google
Drive as well.
Then
load
If you've got links to like stuff you've
If you've got links to like stuff you've
done and about what you think you'd
done and about what you think you'd
charge for something like this, I'd be
charge for something like this, I'd be
uh very happy to get you started.
I can share the link to this.
These are all like, you know, 10 second
These are all like, you know, 10 second
clips or whatever for the most part.
clips or whatever for the most part.
Probably only using a second or two for
Probably only using a second or two for
each. 25 bucks. Yeah, I'll pay you more
each. 25 bucks. Yeah, I'll pay you more
than that if it's good.
So, I mean, they're just games. It's
So, I mean, they're just games. It's
like they're clips of stuff like this.
like they're clips of stuff like this.
Here, I'll show you. But the the import
Here, I'll show you. But the the import
the important part of it is not that not
the important part of it is not that not
that they're So, we've got like stuff
that they're So, we've got like stuff
like this. We've got stuff like stuff
like this. We've got stuff like stuff

like this. We've got, you know, stuff
like uh there's more complex stuff as
like uh there's more complex stuff as
well. stuff like this. But the important
well. stuff like this. But the important
thing here is like we've basically we've
thing here is like we've basically we've
made general purpose training for this
made general purpose training for this
stuff a thousandx faster than it ever
stuff a thousandx faster than it ever
was and so much easier. Like we have all
was and so much easier. Like we have all
these games. They run super fast. We
these games. They run super fast. We
train like these are all models that
train like these are all models that
we've trained on them and they train in
we've trained on them and they train in
like seconds to minutes for the most
like seconds to minutes for the most
part on your local hardware. A few of
part on your local hardware. A few of
them take longer but it's like
them take longer but it's like
ridiculously efficient. So this is like
ridiculously efficient. So this is like
a revolutionary research breakthrough
a revolutionary research breakthrough
more than anything. And I want to convey
more than anything. And I want to convey
it to a slightly larger audience than
it to a slightly larger audience than
normal because like the vast majority of
normal because like the vast majority of
my followers on X are like uh
my followers on X are like uh
reinforcement learning PhDs and
reinforcement learning PhDs and
researchers and people like that. So I'm
researchers and people like that. So I'm
trying to figure out how I can make it
trying to figure out how I can make it
like you know a little bit broader than
like you know a little bit broader than
that.
that.
Let me share the link to this.
Let me share the link to this.
Right. But the import the importance
Right. But the import the importance
Yeah. And I can also I can show you the
Yeah. And I can also I can show you the
trailer that I did last time. So the the
trailer that I did last time. So the the
one that I did for my previous release
one that I did for my previous release
uh was I mean I made it myself so it
uh was I mean I made it myself so it
wasn't very good. Right. So it's this
wasn't very good. Right. So it's this
this is this is what I did for my
this is this is what I did for my
previous release. I kind of just cut
previous release. I kind of just cut
them all together
them all together
and then you'll see the little animation
and then you'll see the little animation
I made at the end which I still have the
I made at the end which I still have the
code for. Like I could include it but
code for. Like I could include it but
I'm looking to do something more than
I'm looking to do something more than
this.
It's the pinned post. Nice. So, how how
It's the pinned post. Nice. So, how how
long did that take you to do? Just I can
long did that take you to do? Just I can
make it better. That took me I mean that
make it better. That took me I mean that
took me a few hours because I don't edit
took me a few hours because I don't edit
videos. Yeah. Yeah. So, just like keep
videos. Yeah. Yeah. So, just like keep
the a like the audience in mind is like
the a like the audience in mind is like
we're trying to get like more industry
we're trying to get like more industry
people involved, you know. Um this is
people involved, you know. Um this is
all free stuff, but we do have a
all free stuff, but we do have a
business side to this and we're looking
business side to this and we're looking
for people in industry who are
for people in industry who are
interested in all the reinforcement
interested in all the reinforcement
learning stuff we do.
learning stuff we do.
[Music]
If you want to get people in industry
If you want to get people in industry
interested, you should do more
interested, you should do more
highlights of like other uses of
highlights of like other uses of
reinforcement learning. We're building
reinforcement learning. We're building
up to that.
up to that.
Like we're building new like the the uh
Like we're building new like the the uh
Terraform sim for instance is
Terraform sim for instance is
specifically to attempt to do stuff with
specifically to attempt to do stuff with
real hardware. Uh the drone sim is as
real hardware. Uh the drone sim is as
well. Like there there's several that
well. Like there there's several that
we're starting on. Um how do I let's see
we're starting on. Um how do I let's see
share this
share this
uh share
anyone.

Copy.
Copy.
And I put this in there. That ought to
And I put this in there. That ought to
work for you.
30 seconds. Yep.
30 seconds. Yep.
I can get you more stuff for this. Like
I can get you more stuff for this. Like
I don't know if it makes sense. Like I
I don't know if it makes sense. Like I
like ideally there if you come up with
like ideally there if you come up with
some cool ideas you can it you got it's
some cool ideas you can it you got it's
got to not be something that's going to
got to not be something that's going to
put off like you know industry people or
put off like you know industry people or
whatever. I don't want like some hip-hop
whatever. I don't want like some hip-hop
stuff or I don't want like it's also the
stuff or I don't want like it's also the
licensing of that stuff. There's a lot
licensing of that stuff. There's a lot
like I'd be open let's say I'd be open
like I'd be open let's say I'd be open
to it if we get something that's
to it if we get something that's
tasteful. Um
tasteful. Um
but I think a lot of people just scroll
but I think a lot of people just scroll
do stuff on X muted.
do stuff on X muted.
So here like let me see. So like I don't
So here like let me see. So like I don't
know if we want to do something like
know if we want to do something like
this. Look.
So literally this is how long it takes
So literally this is how long it takes
to uh to train an AI to play Breakout. I
to uh to train an AI to play Breakout. I
literally start this run and within the
literally start this run and within the
30 second trailer it's already done.
30 second trailer it's already done.
Promote some links on it.
Promote some links on it.
Um
Um
here
I can yeah I can show you one sec. So
I can yeah I can show you one sec. So
like literally this has been 23 seconds.
like literally this has been 23 seconds.
Okay. I've just trained this on my
Okay. I've just trained this on my
desktop right here. And then
now I have an AI that can play Breakout
now I have an AI that can play Breakout
like perfectly.
like perfectly.
But I don't know if there's something
But I don't know if there's something
cool we can do where like at the start
cool we can do where like at the start
of it we start training it and we put it
of it we start training it and we put it
up in the corner and then like by the
up in the corner and then like by the
end like it's like hey look this is
end like it's like hey look this is
trained during this is this AI video
trained during this is this AI video
editor this thing here.
editor this thing here.
No.
Do you want me to promote some links? So
Do you want me to promote some links? So
yeah. So it's our stuff is at puffer.ai.
yeah. So it's our stuff is at puffer.ai.
We don't have all the new environments
We don't have all the new environments
uploaded yet but you know we have all
uploaded yet but you know we have all
the ones that I showed you from before.
the ones that I showed you from before.
Um, and then it's this is going to go on
Um, and then it's this is going to go on
my X and on my YouTube as well. So,
my X and on my YouTube as well. So,
stuff will be under there and there.
So, yeah, like for context here, right,
So, yeah, like for context here, right,
I just trained this AI in under 30
I just trained this AI in under 30
seconds. This is something that would
seconds. This is something that would
take hours or like days before this. Um,
so we kind of want to get people excited
so we kind of want to get people excited
about the tech.
about the tech.
I'm a researcher. I work on this stuff
I'm a researcher. I work on this stuff
all the time. We work on this really
all the time. We work on this really
complicated technical stuff and it's
complicated technical stuff and it's
like I want to figure out a way to show
like I want to figure out a way to show
show more people this stuff, right?
And I don't know if I like I want to
And I don't know if I like I want to
make it clear as well that it's not just
make it clear as well that it's not just
games. Like AI has a very long history
games. Like AI has a very long history
of using games for stuff because they
of using games for stuff because they
tend to like they're actually really
tend to like they're actually really
good for developing the tech. But you
good for developing the tech. But you
know, we have more than just games. Like
know, we have more than just games. Like
where's the sim we built?
Like we're actually we're starting to
Like we're actually we're starting to
have much more than just games on this.
have much more than just games on this.
if I can find the uh where did I put it.
if I can find the uh where did I put it.
There.
So, like in here there's also there's
So, like in here there's also there's
this drone sim that I just got submitted
this drone sim that I just got submitted
today. So, this is actually a simulator
today. So, this is actually a simulator
of a drone. We have this terraforming
of a drone. We have this terraforming
end which we're starting to use to like
end which we're starting to use to like
think about how we can train
think about how we can train
uh construction, how we can use
uh construction, how we can use
construction equipment to like terraform
construction equipment to like terraform
an environment. The clip I sent you is
an environment. The clip I sent you is
better. This is like a a weaker model
better. This is like a a weaker model
than the one I sent you, but that's like
than the one I sent you, but that's like
a bulldozer sim. We've got this driving
a bulldozer sim. We've got this driving
sim. We're starting to think about like
sim. We're starting to think about like
autonomous driving stuff. Like there's a
autonomous driving stuff. Like there's a
lot we can do with this.
lot we can do with this.
Yeah, I put the drive link in the chat.
Yeah, I put the drive link in the chat.
I can put it in there again.
And then my DMs here are open on X. Um,
And then my DMs here are open on X. Um,
so just like message me here.
so just like message me here.
We'll get something going.
Uh, hang on. Let me get you the link
Uh, hang on. Let me get you the link
again.
I'll I'll see you guys later. Let me
I'll I'll see you guys later. Let me
know if there's anything further. You
know if there's anything further. You
can DM me or whatever. There you go.
can DM me or whatever. There you go.
There's link.
There's link.
Yeah, let me let me let me DM it to you.
Yeah, let me let me let me DM it to you.
Hang on. I got to figure out how to DM
Hang on. I got to figure out how to DM
you because
you because
uh where's
it? Literally hid your thing for some
it? Literally hid your thing for some
reason. That's silly.
reason. That's silly.
Message
they are.
they are.
That was funny. You literally got this
That was funny. You literally got this
like instantly and hopped in stream like
like instantly and hopped in stream like
to chat. That's awesome.
But I mean it's like it's it's like
But I mean it's like it's it's like
several minutes of clips for like a 30
several minutes of clips for like a 30
second trailer. So the idea is you can
second trailer. So the idea is you can
pick out like a second here, a second
pick out like a second here, a second
there. I mean probably like these
there. I mean probably like these
simpler environments are so simple that
simpler environments are so simple that
you can probably put many of them in the
you can probably put many of them in the
same frame. Um and like maybe the cooler
same frame. Um and like maybe the cooler
ones get full screened. I don't know.
ones get full screened. I don't know.
It's like part most of what I'm doing
It's like part most of what I'm doing
right is I'm looking for somebody to
right is I'm looking for somebody to
come up with like a creative way to clip
come up with like a creative way to clip
this stuff together. Somebody who's had
this stuff together. Somebody who's had
like that creative experience because I
like that creative experience because I
just haven't. I write code all day,
just haven't. I write code all day,
right? I'm a researcher.
That's downloading.
You get a sense of the audience though,
You get a sense of the audience though,
right? It's like mostly professionals,
right? It's like mostly professionals,
maybe hobbyists, right? But like I'm
maybe hobbyists, right? But like I'm
trying to expand a bit around like the
trying to expand a bit around like the
formal researchers, like people in
formal researchers, like people in
industry who are sort of thinking about
industry who are sort of thinking about
AI and maybe looking for cool stuff,
AI and maybe looking for cool stuff,
right? That type of a thing. Yeah. Yeah.
right? That type of a thing. Yeah. Yeah.
This is So this is what I was trying to
This is So this is what I was trying to
get. I was trying to get somebody who
get. I was trying to get somebody who
would sort of listen to this stuff and
would sort of listen to this stuff and
sort of like get a picture of of really
sort of like get a picture of of really
what I'm trying to do here, right?
what I'm trying to do here, right?
Cuz I was like looking on Upwork and
Cuz I was like looking on Upwork and
it's like are they actually going to
it's like are they actually going to
work? Like is somebody going to actually
work? Like is somebody going to actually
work and like take the time to figure
work and like take the time to figure
out like the thing I'm trying to build,
out like the thing I'm trying to build,
right?
It's usually mixed. Like I've gotten
It's usually mixed. Like I've gotten
like really good stuff off of there, but
like really good stuff off of there, but
then I've also gotten just like crap off
then I've also gotten just like crap off
of there.
I mean, I have some ideas, right? Like I
I mean, I have some ideas, right? Like I
said, I It might be a cool thing. And I
said, I It might be a cool thing. And I
could get you a clip of this, right? If
could get you a clip of this, right? If
we think I like I should do
we think I like I should do
Maybe I should just get a clip of this
Maybe I should just get a clip of this
right now.
You record this.
Oh yeah.
See if this works this time. There's
See if this works this time. There's
like a very slight variance to it.
This seems like it works though.
So, let me put that in the drive view as
So, let me put that in the drive view as
well.
I don't know if there's something where
I don't know if there's something where
it's like you can like just show this at
it's like you can like just show this at
the start and like put it up in the
the start and like put it up in the
corner and then it comes back and by the
corner and then it comes back and by the
end it's trained. Um,
if you want other assets from me, like
if you want other assets from me, like
let me know as well. If you like think
let me know as well. If you like think
of like, oh, it would be cool if you had
of like, oh, it would be cool if you had
something that did this or that.
That bot.
That bot.
Oh.
Okay.
Pretty well. It I know. I also have I
Pretty well. It I know. I also have I
also have all sorts of graphs. I don't
also have all sorts of graphs. I don't
know if any of these are useful.
know if any of these are useful.
Like this is a pretty crazy graph. It's
Like this is a pretty crazy graph. It's
just a line. But the thing is this
just a line. But the thing is this
X-axis, this is this is basically a
X-axis, this is this is basically a
model that has played the g like this is
model that has played the g like this is
the MMO game, the one with like the
the MMO game, the one with like the
slashing and the bows and stuff pixel
slashing and the bows and stuff pixel
art. So this thing has played this game
art. So this thing has played this game
for like literally 10,000 years in this
for like literally 10,000 years in this
graph. It's still running. Um it's going
graph. It's still running. Um it's going
to play the game for 20,000 years before
to play the game for 20,000 years before
it's done fully. But like yeah, this
it's done fully. But like yeah, this
thing it literally like it's running
thing it literally like it's running
like simulation at 10,000 times plus
like simulation at 10,000 times plus
real time.
real time.
Oh, of course.
I'm going to go to bed in a in a few and
I'm going to go to bed in a in a few and
then probably check back in the morning
then probably check back in the morning
if that sounds good.
Quick question for you before you go,
Quick question for you before you go,
Joseph, if that's all right. Um, so I'm
Joseph, if that's all right. Um, so I'm
I've I've looked over the math. Um, I'm
I've I've looked over the math. Um, I'm
almost sure it's not that. Um, besides
almost sure it's not that. Um, besides
the observation size, is there anything

I should be uh double-checking to
I should be uh double-checking to
um double checking that you're actually
