okay we are
okay we are
live and it's so
obnoxious when uh the internet just
obnoxious when uh the internet just
freaking crashes on
me get restream back up
G token
okay cool we're going to
okay cool we're going to
start
start
with repoing this experiment
this
one this one
okay so this was our
okay so this was our
previous I back last one
previous I back last one
here and then there
is yeah there we go
I think this was good about this is a
I think this was good about this is a
good reference
so we will
see this one has a fair bit of overhead
see this one has a fair bit of overhead
do
it for
we not getting stuck now are we
back us to build is killer
we'll try without the initialization as
we'll try without the initialization as
well maybe the initialization is
well maybe the initialization is
screwing it up
so
unstable
e e
now you got to remember right that
now you got to remember right that
there's also a selection bias here so
there's also a selection bias here so
the brown curve is like you ran a whole
the brown curve is like you ran a whole
bunch of experiments and then looking at
bunch of experiments and then looking at
the most stable of them cuz if we looked
the most stable of them cuz if we looked
at the most stable one of this one it
at the most stable one of this one it
also looked nice and
smooth e
this is still either solved or very very
this is still either solved or very very
close to
close to
solved with this run
yeah there you
go got Sol
go got Sol
score 62 yeah
yeah okay so this is also solved these
yeah okay so this is also solved these
both solve solved at 100
Mil I'm going to take the scaling out
Mil I'm going to take the scaling out
just in case and the
clamping take this out
just in
case do that doesn't even necessarily
case do that doesn't even necessarily
mean that this is bad or anything it
mean that this is bad or anything it
just means that uh possibly the hyper
just means that uh possibly the hyper
parameters don't agree with it we'll run
parameters don't agree with it we'll run
it like this
it like this
next we'll see what that
does these are the results we
does these are the results we
need these are the results we need for
honestly this is starting to look on
honestly this is starting to look on
par because if I just copied this right
par because if I just copied this right
we also have the other breakout
we also have the other breakout
sweep from a while ago I believe this
sweep from a while ago I believe this
was the good
was the good
one okay so this is the other breakout
one okay so this is the other breakout
sweep we have this parito
front right here we have solved in 279
front right here we have solved in 279
seconds is the best and mind you there's
seconds is the best and mind you there's
about a
about a
20% overhead it looks
20% overhead it looks
like uh that we've added with this extra
function
function
so and we're going to be able to remove
that uh
also 538 and
162 this portion of the curve looks
162 this portion of the curve looks
better which would suggest to me that
probably the whole curve is better
probably the whole curve is better
right these tend to be very
steep we're definitely going to have to
steep we're definitely going to have to
see what's going on over here
all right this is
all right this is
something it's pretty close on the
original
e e
I'm pretty content to just keep running
I'm pretty content to just keep running
these experiments tonight
going to be
going to be
big be very big
this is kind of
this is kind of
wild to give you an idea of how
wild to give you an idea of how
significant this would

enough they don't have the
enough they don't have the

as this seems more stable better also to
as this seems more stable better also to
give you an idea of how substantial I
give you an idea of how substantial I
mean this is just like me fiddling with

what do they even have in Ray to
what do they even have in Ray to
they even have anything good in here
now to their credit they have a lot of

the
the
algorithms I think ours is better
though but here's the funny thing right
though but here's the funny thing right
you have all these libraries for this
you have all these libraries for this
here's my
code if we ignore the comments it's like
code if we ignore the comments it's like
500 lines I think it's less than 500
500 lines I think it's less than 500

comments this is the new

algorithm all right this is Paro genetic
algorithm all right this is Paro genetic
it's one
screen yeah I do require pyro for the
screen yeah I do require pyro for the
new algorithm because you need gen
new algorithm because you need gen
gaussian processes but that's it
gaussian processes but that's it
want to clean code then you use this
want to clean code then you use this
right you use our stuff we have the

learning today
I want things I can hack in well puffer
I want things I can hack in well puffer
is very easy to hack because it is very

short by
puffer exactly they make it hard puer we
puffer exactly they make it hard puer we
make it
make it
easy why do difficult thing when easy
easy why do difficult thing when easy
thing just is
good for
so now this
so now this
works and the only thing I really need
works and the only thing I really need
to figure out is how to make this robust
to figure out is how to make this robust
to different um value prediction
to different um value prediction
Horizons that's all I need to sort
out e
oops I missed some messages it looks
like
e e
okay we'll see how this
okay we'll see how this
goes they're kind of two things that
goes they're kind of two things that
could happen here right one is that this
could happen here right one is that this
just doesn't work as well when you
just doesn't work as well when you
increase the Horizon uh but what I'm
increase the Horizon uh but what I'm
hoping is that there's just like a
hoping is that there's just like a
startup period That's longer while it
startup period That's longer while it
figures out how to adjust the effective
figures out how to adjust the effective
Horizon
okay I'm trying to think if there's any
okay I'm trying to think if there's any
reason why it would be fundamentally
reason why it would be fundamentally
harder with longer
harder with longer
Horizon I don't think
so I wouldn't think so I play the
so I wouldn't think so I play the
opposite it should be
better why is it not better
increasing Horizon should Grant more
capacity doesn't seem to though
it could just be the advantage function
it could just be the advantage function
being
silly if we're looking at initialization
silly if we're looking at initialization
versus Advantage
function probably Advantage function is
function probably Advantage function is
the place to look
the place to look
right
yeah e
Captain these are both G these are both
Captain these are both G these are both
no G right here
the only thing we haven't figured out
the only thing we haven't figured out
yet is how to make it robust when you
yet is how to make it robust when you
have longer value prediction
have longer value prediction
Horizons what made it so much faster
Horizons what made it so much faster
hyper pram sweeps we had to redo
hyper pram sweeps we had to redo
hyperparameter
optimization I mean we still have to
optimization I mean we still have to
do yeah I know it's huge
do yeah I know it's huge
right the thing is we still have to do
right the thing is we still have to do
like major major experimentation but
like major major experimentation but
this is what I'm saying like if you want
this is what I'm saying like if you want
to get involved with the experiment side
to get involved with the experiment side
I'm fixing
I'm fixing
RL like this is not like little like
RL like this is not like little like
shitty research we are actually going to
shitty research we are actually going to
fix RL this
fix RL this
year right like literally as soon as you
year right like literally as soon as you
point puffer lip in the general
point puffer lip in the general
direction of something and you do
direction of something and you do
research at this speed with like any
research at this speed with like any
degree of competence stuff
solved I mean literally if you were
solved I mean literally if you were
running this on uh on cleanar you would
running this on uh on cleanar you would
be waiting weeks for these
be waiting weeks for these
results sp3 weeks for these results you
results sp3 weeks for these results you
wouldn't even be able to implement the
wouldn't even be able to implement the
thing as easily because like you'd have
thing as easily because like you'd have
to go dig through sp3 algorithm code
puffer very
good got to go now you let me know when
good got to go now you let me know when
you're around I briefed Spencer
already whenever you want to get
already whenever you want to get
involved we'll be here
for
e e
okay so this is very nice and
okay so this is very nice and
stable um it underperforms
stable um it underperforms
majorly we're going to figure out why
majorly we're going to figure out why
why
yeah so okay this is a nice stable curve
yeah so okay this is a nice stable curve
it's just there's like some noise or
it's just there's like some noise or
something so we'll figure this out
next so
um
yeah the next thing I would like to
do is we will compare this run
do
this so we are setting the scale to
this so we are setting the scale to
zero Beyond 32 and we see what this
zero Beyond 32 and we see what this
changes
I don't know this guy
so still lagging
so still lagging
right now the question I have is is this
right now the question I have is is this
going to be on par with the
going to be on par with the
original or
original or
not looks like it's a bit steep steeper
not looks like it's a bit steep steeper
but it's very
early so essentially here right
early so essentially here right
if this doesn't work if this works on
if this doesn't work if this works on
par with this then the error is coming
par with this then the error is coming
from the NL law
from the NL law
somehow and if it does work then we're
somehow and if it does work then we're
set and if it's in between then I don't
set and if it's in between then I don't
know
welcome
folks this
is evening algorithm
is evening algorithm
Dev and mostly a bunch of
experiments
experiments
H we'll see what this is on par with
so I've had results before where it
so I've had results before where it
doesn't seem like doing this alone fixes
doesn't seem like doing this alone fixes
the
the
problem so if that were the
case if that were the
case then the only other place the
case then the only other place the
problem can come from is the NL loss
right okay so you know what we'll do
right okay so you know what we'll do
next
next
is we will uh we'll mask the
is we will uh we'll mask the
loss so if this doesn't give us on power
loss so if this doesn't give us on power
performance we'll mask the loss and that
performance we'll mask the loss and that
should have to give us onar
performance and then maybe we'll do it
performance and then maybe we'll do it
the other way around so we mask uh one
the other way around so we mask uh one
and not the
and not the
other so this just
crashed weird
so we have a
plan e
this looks like it's going to be on par
here I unfortunately we do need to do
here I unfortunately we do need to do
the whole runs on
the whole runs on
these they are slow
these they are slow
I'd really like to know about this 34%
though presumably I just have to find a
though presumably I just have to find a
way to make the scyon
faster it's fine though we're
chilling I guess I can just think about
chilling I guess I can just think about
some plant for this
so I don't think it's going to be be
so I don't think it's going to be be
quite time to merge this yet I still
quite time to merge this yet I still
want to test the hyper Prim
want to test the hyper Prim
sweeps independently not on
this
this
yeah so we're going to refine the hyper
yeah so we're going to refine the hyper
pram sweep
pram sweep
stuff a little
stuff a little
bit breakout seems like a very good end
bit breakout seems like a very good end
for biddings with stuff
trains pretty
trains pretty
fast sweeps don't take too long
fast sweeps don't take too long
anymore so probably I'm going to play
anymore so probably I'm going to play
with the last remaining things that I
with the last remaining things that I
wanted to play with on hyper pram sweeps
wanted to play with on hyper pram sweeps
over
over
there and
there and
then we'll probably start running
then we'll probably start running
benchmarks
benchmarks
on well we'll merge that into this in
on well we'll merge that into this in
parallel we'll start running sweeps on
parallel we'll start running sweeps on
both for all the different MS
both for all the different MS
I think the new sweep algorithm is
I think the new sweep algorithm is
efficient enough we probably don't need
efficient enough we probably don't need
200 experiments per end probably only
200 experiments per end probably only
need
100 that'll also give us good evidence
100 that'll also give us good evidence
on this algorithm
what would it imply if this is slightly
what would it imply if this is slightly
above the other
one the nll
loss oh if this is slightly above the
loss oh if this is slightly above the
other one it just implies that at least
other one it just implies that at least
some small amount of the
some small amount of the
of the performance drop is attributable
of the performance drop is attributable
to the computation of the advantage
to the computation of the advantage
function that's all that
implies
yeah which would make
yeah which would make
sense and then NL is the other part of
sense and then NL is the other part of
it but the thing is I don't know how we
it but the thing is I don't know how we
fix
fix
NL like why would that be a
NL like why would that be a
problem why would Computing an NL loss
problem why would Computing an NL loss
over
over
more was it gaan negative log likelihood
more was it gaan negative log likelihood
why would Computing that
why would Computing that
over larger
over larger
sample create more error I don't think
sample create more error I don't think
that's how the law should work
knowing I still have to run the full
knowing I still have to run the full
thing for the end state
thing for the end state
but how's this going in the
meantime
meantime
oo 334 in 100
oo 334 in 100
seconds for reference this is about how
seconds for reference this is about how
well um original like sp3 and clean ARL
well um original like sp3 and clean ARL
does in I think an hour or two
get a nice burrito front
here burrito
optimal for the folks watching
optimal for the folks watching
all this is on
all this is on
puff. including the latest commits all
puff. including the latest commits all
the dev branches are public you can play
the dev branches are public you can play
with all this uh the results right as
with all this uh the results right as
they come
out start the repo if you do really
out start the repo if you do really
helps me
out pretty much I just track stars on
out pretty much I just track stars on
the repo and kind of X
the repo and kind of X
followers it's pretty much it
followers it's pretty much it
for growth of puffer
lib reason I have to wait for this whole
lib reason I have to wait for this whole
thing is because the end State sometimes
thing is because the end State sometimes
it can jump up at the end quite a
bit this one looks to have been pretty
bit this one looks to have been pretty
stable oh no we get the spike at the end
stable oh no we get the spike at the end
a little bit
650 it's about on par with this one
here so next we mask uh the
nlll for
what
what
happened in
it's other way
it's other way
around
around
32 there we go
so this should be identical to the
so this should be identical to the
original
run this is meant as a like a hard check
run this is meant as a like a hard check
on the horizon if something screw is
on the horizon if something screw is
happening
cuz now I have Horizon 128 but I have
cuz now I have Horizon 128 but I have
everything masked to be the same as uh
everything masked to be the same as uh
as
as
32 so if this doesn't
work and yeah some just really
work and yeah some just really
screwy and then that's most likely just
screwy and then that's most likely just
a bug so we just have to go hunt the
bug given that it looks like there is
bug given that it looks like there is
one we can start looking for
it okay the first 32 elements and this
it okay the first 32 elements and this
is a mean
is a mean
so
so
oh you're stupid
be really careful with these
things you make dumb mistakes well at
things you make dumb mistakes well at
least I make dumb mistakes when I've
least I make dumb mistakes when I've
been doing this
been doing this
for know most of the day
that's more like
it I still don't know if this will
it I still don't know if this will
match we will see
oh you know
what could that have been
it if I took the mean over the
loss it could literally be a scaling
loss it could literally be a scaling
issue right
let's see what this does before we make
let's see what this does before we make
any conclusion on that but it could
any conclusion on that but it could
literally be a scaling
issue if most of the signal is in the
issue if most of the signal is in the
first spot of the like the first chunk
first spot of the like the first chunk
of the loss and we take a
in and wouldn't think it should be some
in and wouldn't think it should be some
over the last Dimension though right
over the last Dimension though right
that would be
weird but think about
it it sucks that there's hardly any any
it it sucks that there's hardly any any
RL news on X anymore like everybody's
RL news on X anymore like everybody's
just gone and done llms
h
that's
funny where's the
RL if only people had AR Tech this is
RL if only people had AR Tech this is
like a fun gimmick it would be so easy
like a fun gimmick it would be so easy
to get RL working on an end like
to get RL working on an end like
this it's a fun gimmick but these don't
this it's a fun gimmick but these don't
actually you know these
actually you know these
D like nobody's going to like look at a
D like nobody's going to like look at a
thing through their phone and be like oh
thing through their phone and be like oh
wow it renders in 3D on my phone on the
camera we got 309 and 30
camera we got 309 and 30
that any
good oh yeah that looks on par with the
good oh yeah that looks on par with the
other
runs still have to run the whole damn
runs still have to run the whole damn
thing
but it could just be a whole scaling
issue question is what do we do if it is
issue question is what do we do if it is
a SC scaling
issue and why would it be a scaling
issue if you take a me
it's
like what do you do instead you take a
some a Thum doesn't work either that's
some a Thum doesn't work either that's
still doesn't scale
perfectly I want to fiddle with the
perfectly I want to fiddle with the
scales a little bit
there's so many versions of this to
run that's got to just be drift right
run that's got to just be drift right
that's showing up is
that's showing up is
better yeah it can't possibly just be
better yeah it can't possibly just be
better it's the same thing as
better it's the same thing as
before yeah there you go it's just some
before yeah there you go it's just some
Drift But if it's on par
Drift But if it's on par
and then we'll have to just figure out
and then we'll have to just figure out
if it's scaling or
what if it is
scaling it can't be credit assignment
scaling it can't be credit assignment
right
no there really should be no
no there really should be no
way for that loss to be messed
up unless it's a network capacity issue
up unless it's a network capacity issue
but I don't think that makes sense
but I don't think that makes sense
here oh here's a
here oh here's a
dip but this is not uncommon right the
dip but this is not uncommon right the
other experiment dipped as well that's
other experiment dipped as well that's
not I mean that's not a killer here it's
not I mean that's not a killer here it's
already back up
yeah there you
go
e e
I'm going to call this curve a match
I'm going to call this curve a match
because this one bump is like common and
because this one bump is like common and
the end Point's the same the general
the end Point's the same the general
shape is the
same and make sure the end Point's
same and make sure the end Point's
actually the
actually the
same I do wonder what it is that causes
same I do wonder what it is that causes
this type of thing though right it's
this type of thing though right it's
like temporary policy collapse and
like temporary policy collapse and
rebound this can't just be random noise
rebound this can't just be random noise
this is too big for random noise random
this is too big for random noise random
noise is on the scale of like these
noise is on the scale of like these
little jaggies you see here this is like
little jaggies you see here this is like
genuine
collapse is this collapsed back
again now we're
good okay that's the repo with 128 with
good okay that's the repo with 128 with
everything
everything
masked provided this is not going to
masked provided this is not going to
screw up
screw up
here I mean even still it's like it's
here I mean even still it's like it's
there so we're good so
now okay so this is this is
the this is the
the this is the
Repro and then we'll do this will just
Repro and then we'll do this will just
be mean of zero
do
do
sum over
32 so we're going to try this
32 so we're going to try this
one so this is going to take the same
one so this is going to take the same
scale and basically just assume that the
scale and basically just assume that the
last elements don't contribute
anything it's probably not a great
assumption is there a vloss norm on
here there is no Norm on
here there is no Norm on
vloss there's a
vloss there's a
clip and not a
norm norming value law seems fine
oh yeah that's a full solve 864 is fully
solved we're not expecting this to
solved we're not expecting this to
match we're just expecting this to do
match we're just expecting this to do
something in
between okay
so exciting
it's
it's
slower again all this has to do is land
slower again all this has to do is land
in the
middle and then if this does land in the
middle and then if this does land in the
middle then what we do is we take some
middle then what we do is we take some
sort of
normalization and we throw some
normalization and we throw some
normalization on
it6
see
for e
all
okay that's
something we still have to do this
something we still have to do this
without the clipping and then if
without the clipping and then if
if this all works then it's just pure
if this all works then it's just pure
normalization is the
normalization is the
issue there might still have to be some
issue there might still have to be some
clipping we'll
see but essentially if we're able to
see but essentially if we're able to
match it means that we should be able to
match it means that we should be able to
have it should be Horizon independent
have it should be Horizon independent
you should be able to give it a longer
you should be able to give it a longer
Horizon it'll either do the same or will
Horizon it'll either do the same or will
do
better CU longer Horizon environments
better CU longer Horizon environments
will make use of more of of the value
function e
it's flattened
it's flattened
out we'll see terminal

strong just a few things we have to
fiddle with
still this curve is a little
still this curve is a little
weird it was matching
it slow
it slow
down well again we didn't expect to be
down well again we didn't expect to be
perfect so that's kind of okay
the only thing we need to do is to be
the only thing we need to do is to be
better than the bottom set of

bonus s you would have been working

structure if you have a thing that
you're simulating is well I'd have to
you're simulating is well I'd have to
look at it and see how I would cast it
look at it and see how I would cast it
as a

light wait is there a thing that is
there actually a loophole in speed of
there actually a loophole in speed of
light
is there a speed of light loophole
is there a speed of light loophole
nobody told me
nobody told me
about this is very very close so I'll
about this is very very close so I'll
call this a
call this a
match this is so darn close
match this is so darn close
right in
water electrons can move
oh in the material so there there so
oh in the material so there there so
there isn't an exploit on the absolute
there isn't an exploit on the absolute
speed of
speed of
light there's nothing that goes
light there's nothing that goes
faster damn it I was hoping you were
faster damn it I was hoping you were
going to tell me there's a loophole
okay this is very
close you got me
excited I would love the speed of light
loophole see because there if there is
loophole see because there if there is
any sort of speed of light
any sort of speed of light
loophole I bet that we're going to be
loophole I bet that we're going to be
able to have like faster than light
able to have like faster than light
travel and stuff and that would be
travel and stuff and that would be
pretty cool
pretty cool
we get to have some sci-fi
stuff if you can produce anyim
stuff if you can produce anyim
matter make an engine that gets close to
matter make an engine that gets close to
the speed of
light you would feel no
light you would feel no
time yeah but then you would get the
time yeah but then you would get the
like shitty version of sci-fi right in
like shitty version of sci-fi right in
which like you don't feel any time pass
which like you don't feel any time pass
but everybody else feels years of time
pass that's like the shitty sci-fi vers
now we want the Sci-Fi version where it
now we want the Sci-Fi version where it
just freaking works and uh you and then
just freaking works and uh you and then
we can just like hop all over the
we can just like hop all over the
universe whenever we want that's the
universe whenever we want that's the
cool
one don't think I can crack that one
one don't think I can crack that one
yeah we'll wait for AI to crack that
one I think ai's got to delete has got
one I think ai's got to delete has got
to deliver us at least one crazy sci-fi
to deliver us at least one crazy sci-fi
thing before we really take get too
thing before we really take get too
seriously we at least have it has to
seriously we at least have it has to
give us like one crazy thing straight
give us like one crazy thing straight
out of sci-fi
well hopefully not that
well hopefully not that
sci-fi I'm thinking more um you know
sci-fi I'm thinking more um you know
culture series or
something e
I need to
I need to
focus
focus
well you don't take it too
seriously the thing is it's possible now
seriously the thing is it's possible now
is pretty boring you got to give
is pretty boring you got to give
something you got to have something to
something you got to have something to
get you to get up in the morning right
well as you can see I am here doing the
work would we like to check the number
work would we like to check the number
of Dev hours streamed this
of Dev hours streamed this
month it's quite a lot
two major breakthroughs this
month e
see if this is a little
less I wonder if we should also try this
less I wonder if we should also try this
with the
clipping the clipping should be the same
clipping the clipping should be the same
shouldn't
shouldn't
it I mean I guess we'll look at
it I mean I guess we'll look at
it clipping should be the
same want to try that as well a lot of
same want to try that as well a lot of
just manual experiments
today when it's for something this big I
today when it's for something this big I
don't mind it
sh
how big of a
how big of a
jump so let's say that it performs
jump so let's say that it performs
exactly the same as generalized
exactly the same as generalized
Advantage estimation okay let's say that
Advantage estimation okay let's say that
that's the bar that we get it to work
that's the bar that we get it to work
exactly as well as the previous
exactly as well as the previous
one you
one you
add you just make your existing you
add you just make your existing you
change this form of your existing loss
change this form of your existing loss
terms you make the loss
terms you make the loss
layer bigger but that should be
layer bigger but that should be
essentially free and you delete two very
essentially free and you delete two very
fiddly hyper parameters from the
algorithm you no longer have to sweep
algorithm you no longer have to sweep
two hyper parameters
that's the cool
thing no it doesn't cut down the compute
thing no it doesn't cut down the compute
on a 1 million parameter run it cuts
on a 1 million parameter run it cuts
down the hyperparameter search so that
down the hyperparameter search so that
means a few things first of all you have
means a few things first of all you have
to run fewer experiments in order to get
to run fewer experiments in order to get
optimal hyper parameters and second it
optimal hyper parameters and second it
is much much more likely that you will
is much much more likely that you will
able be able to use the same hyper
able be able to use the same hyper
parameters across many different
parameters across many different
environments and have it perform quite
environments and have it perform quite
well out of the
box so this would be a large step
box so this would be a large step
forward for out of the box reinforcement
learning pong to other games may be pong
learning pong to other games may be pong
to other Sims
entirely you cut out I think it
entirely you cut out I think it
the probably the second and the third
the probably the second and the third
most fiddly hyper parameters in
most fiddly hyper parameters in
RL so you cut out two of the top
RL so you cut out two of the top
three you know most annoying hyper
three you know most annoying hyper
parameters in
RL yep
gamma
Lambda you can tune a hyper parameter
Lambda you can tune a hyper parameter
but you can't tune a

I saw one
I saw one
snorkeling like uh a month month and a
snorkeling like uh a month month and a
half
ago they're very amusing
okay so this is better than the other
okay so this is better than the other
ones but
ones but
needs maybe
needs maybe
clipping we'll try clipping
next I was on vacation I wasn't
next I was on vacation I wasn't

technically find some manties though
technically find some manties though
that would be
that would be
cool but I can also literally just like
cool but I can also literally just like
take a 30 second walk outside and just
take a 30 second walk outside and just
see alligators just chilling by the side
see alligators just chilling by the side

chilling there waiting to Chomp
you I have no idea why those things are
protected that could be a winers worth a

shoes and one last thing to worry about
chomping you
this is a bot up
it's
funny just
want 120
mil my question is is this going to
mil my question is is this going to
track the previous run or is this going
track the previous run or is this going
to track this one up
to track this one up
here I would think that it should have
here I would think that it should have
to track the one up there with the
to track the one up there with the
clipping we will see though
I think I'd argue that this is actually
I think I'd argue that this is actually
simpler to implement than
simpler to implement than
um the original po as
well generalized Advantage estimation is
well generalized Advantage estimation is
really awkward to
really awkward to
implement this is a lot easier I'd say
would you ever try Fugu no leave the
would you ever try Fugu no leave the
puffers
alone leave the puffer fish
alone leave the puffer fish
alone they're very friendly

think if there's anything I can do on on

this here
don't think there's any great way I can
don't think there's any great way I can
always optimize the
C e
this freaking
it's funny
this is honestly true
though oh but somebody reused this
picture there was a post on this earlier
picture there was a post on this earlier
that yeah like if you go anywhere with
that yeah like if you go anywhere with
SF you can just get a house like a 1K
SF you can just get a house like a 1K
mortgage on it
just build whatever the hell you
want would you ever go
want would you ever go
where to somewhere in the middle of
where to somewhere in the middle of
nowhere instead of SF I'm current l in
Florida not exactly the tech capital of
Florida not exactly the tech capital of
the world but I'm building whatever
right uh I've been there I don't plan on
right uh I've been there I don't plan on
going
going

back it's kind of just a shitty and
dangerous city at the moment
I don't know how many more Founders have
I don't know how many more Founders have
to get attacked in broad daylight before
to get attacked in broad daylight before
it's like yeah this is just a stupid
it's like yeah this is just a stupid
place to
be I'll be spending a good chunk of the
be I'll be spending a good chunk of the
summer and Paulo Alto
instead 45 minutes south safe nice
cleaner
cleaner
y now Pao Alto is nice Mountain View is
y now Pao Alto is nice Mountain View is
nice I mean honestly a whole bunch of
nice I mean honestly a whole bunch of
areas are
nice okay so I'm interested to know
why why this didn't match
well let it finish to be sure but it
well let it finish to be sure but it
doesn't seem like it
matches
e e
so the fact that that doesn't mitigate
so the fact that that doesn't mitigate
is kind of
weird

uh particular experiments were running
uh particular experiments were running
right now could be a particularly major
right now could be a particularly major
breakthrough let's say
this would be
this would be
a well the first general purpose
a well the first general purpose

2017 he goes through the

well I to be fair I was kind of doing
well I to be fair I was kind of doing
all right doing all right by then

oh hang on there's just a ton of
oh hang on there's just a ton of

there yeah I'm looking at this thing
now I think there might just be a ton of
now I think there might just be a ton of

I know I've never been super big on
uh chain of command well I guess I
uh chain of command well I guess I
wouldn't it's not we don't have any

there's not really a chain of command or
there's not really a chain of command or
anything
I mean there's a don't be a dick rule
right Hulse power

the capacitor and it's like a single use
thing or
I'm just trying to figure how does it
I'm just trying to figure how does it
work if to recharge it you need to

you use
RL that'd be a fun thing to work on to

honest we should do that we should do I
honest we should do that we should do I
mean I could even sci-fi it a little bit
mean I could even sci-fi it a little bit
up and I could just make like a
up and I could just make like a
swarm ship Sim that'd be
fun big
money oh yeah of
course if my primary goal were money I
course if my primary goal were money I
wouldn't be doing this at least not in
wouldn't be doing this at least not in

the way that I'm doing
it it is a goal but it is the secondary

money will

come money will come
how do I get on get in on this swarm Sim
how do I get on get in on this swarm Sim
that's the thing you literally just
that's the thing you literally just
start doing stuff you just start
start doing stuff you just start
building
stuff there's no gatekeeping here here
stuff there's no gatekeeping here here
I'll show you one

okay
okay
so here I built this
so here I built this

contributors who showed up and were like
contributors who showed up and were like
hey I want to build a thing how about
hey I want to build a thing how about
this and I said go for it and then I
this and I said go for it and then I
just you know gave input along the way
just you know gave input along the way
and
and
helped but yeah literally you just start
helped but yeah literally you just start
building
building
Sims and then puffer makes it
fast we have all the resources you need
fast we have all the resources you need
on this
on this
stuff it's much easier than it
looks you don't even you don't have to
looks you don't even you don't have to
do like complicated like you don't have
do like complicated like you don't have
to even do like physics Sim at the level
to even do like physics Sim at the level
of the propellers and like the air flow
of the propellers and like the air flow
and all that like literally if you just
and all that like literally if you just
did uh like ships in 3D space having to
did uh like ships in 3D space having to
like coordinate to do a thing
like coordinate to do a thing
effectively
effectively
yeah I mean this is pretty much how it
yeah I mean this is pretty much how it
works right I get dozens and dozens of
works right I get dozens and dozens of
people asking me like how I get involved
people asking me like how I get involved
in RL I tell everybody look you
in RL I tell everybody look you
literally just show up and build these
literally just show up and build these
Sims and then the ones who stick around
Sims and then the ones who stick around
become you know active contributors and
become you know active contributors and
uh they get Hardware access active
uh they get Hardware access active
contributors get access to our hardware
contributors get access to our hardware
and I do code reviews and you know they
and I do code reviews and you know they
get a lot of good
information hey I invest time in people
information hey I invest time in people
who invest time and puffer that's how
who invest time and puffer that's how
the open source
the open source
works it is remarkably remarkably easy
works it is remarkably remarkably easy
to get involved you just put in a little
to get involved you just put in a little
bit of the
time ultimately we want this to be a
time ultimately we want this to be a
quality open source stuff just need
quality open source stuff just need
people building these environments and
people building these environments and
testing stuff actually two of the
testing stuff actually two of the
contributors now have done so much stuff
contributors now have done so much stuff
on Puffer that I'll be onboarding them
on Puffer that I'll be onboarding them
onto some of the more science side stuff
onto some of the more science side stuff
that I do done one onboarding already
sour is very good
this one I don't entirely
understand like does this just work I
understand like does this just work I
doubt this works right this is probably
unstable not some
yeah that's unstable
right you can see the value
loss
e e
that's
tiny open source waiting on first
tiny open source waiting on first
citation did you just publish
this oh you have a few you have
several I don't even have the Google
several I don't even have the Google
Scholar profile I'm pretty sure
February 1
congrats
e
e e
no bil's published RL in the field yeah
no bil's published RL in the field yeah
rl's hard
well it depends what the search
well it depends what the search
Dimension
Dimension
is I can probably do better than genetic
and the value lost like
this
e e
there's a value clip but there's no
there's a value clip but there's no
value Norm it looks like
genetic algorithms are much easier to
genetic algorithms are much easier to
get working than to than RL which is why
get working than to than RL which is why
a lot of people just start with them but
a lot of people just start with them but
they don't work anywhere near as
they don't work anywhere near as
well like they're easier to implement
well like they're easier to implement
but they don't work anywhere near as
but they don't work anywhere near as
well
yeah there's no Norm just a
clip e
oh you know
oh you know
what I wonder if it's just
um wonder if it's just
um wonder if it's just
this no I wouldn't think so honestly but
this no I wouldn't think so honestly but
maybe
this could be
it numerical gun doesn't know RL
the thing about yet is you can know the
the thing about yet is you can know the
math way better than I do and the

engineering will still bite you
let's see how this goes cuz I think I

maybe this doesn't seem like it matches
maybe this doesn't seem like it matches
the YOLO curve here
but run this I'm going to set up the

power itself is defined as energy

the engineering of taking and
the engineering of taking and
accumulating energy over a longer
accumulating energy over a longer

okay so this was our
okay so this was our
previous I back last one
previous I back last one
here and then there
is yeah there we go
I think this was good about this is a
I think this was good about this is a
good reference
so we will
see this one has a fair bit of overhead
see this one has a fair bit of overhead
do
it for
we not getting stuck now are we
back us to build is killer
we'll try without the initialization as
we'll try without the initialization as
well maybe the initialization is
well maybe the initialization is
screwing it up
so
unstable
e e
now you got to remember right that
now you got to remember right that
there's also a selection bias here so
there's also a selection bias here so
the brown curve is like you ran a whole
the brown curve is like you ran a whole
bunch of experiments and then looking at
bunch of experiments and then looking at
the most stable of them cuz if we looked
the most stable of them cuz if we looked
at the most stable one of this one it
at the most stable one of this one it
also looked nice and
smooth e
this is still either solved or very very
this is still either solved or very very
close to
close to
solved with this run
yeah there you
go got Sol
go got Sol
score 62 yeah
yeah okay so this is also solved these
yeah okay so this is also solved these
both solve solved at 100
Mil I'm going to take the scaling out
Mil I'm going to take the scaling out
just in case and the
clamping take this out
just in
case do that doesn't even necessarily
case do that doesn't even necessarily
mean that this is bad or anything it
mean that this is bad or anything it
just means that uh possibly the hyper
just means that uh possibly the hyper
parameters don't agree with it we'll run
parameters don't agree with it we'll run
it like this
it like this
next we'll see what that
does these are the results we
does these are the results we
need these are the results we need for
honestly this is starting to look on
honestly this is starting to look on
par because if I just copied this right
par because if I just copied this right
we also have the other breakout
we also have the other breakout
sweep from a while ago I believe this
sweep from a while ago I believe this
was the good
was the good
one okay so this is the other breakout
one okay so this is the other breakout
sweep we have this parito
front right here we have solved in 279
front right here we have solved in 279
seconds is the best and mind you there's
seconds is the best and mind you there's
about a
about a
20% overhead it looks
20% overhead it looks
like uh that we've added with this extra
function
function
so and we're going to be able to remove
that uh
also 538 and
162 this portion of the curve looks
162 this portion of the curve looks
better which would suggest to me that
probably the whole curve is better
probably the whole curve is better
right these tend to be very
steep we're definitely going to have to
steep we're definitely going to have to
see what's going on over here
all right this is
all right this is
something it's pretty close on the
original
e e
I'm pretty content to just keep running
I'm pretty content to just keep running
these experiments tonight
going to be
going to be
big be very big
this is kind of
this is kind of
wild to give you an idea of how

as this seems more stable better also to

give you an idea of how substantial I
give you an idea of how substantial I
mean this is just like me fiddling with

now to their credit they have a lot of

you have all these libraries for this
you have all these libraries for this
here's my

it's one
screen yeah I do require pyro for the
screen yeah I do require pyro for the
new algorithm because you need gen
new algorithm because you need gen
gaussian processes but that's it
gaussian processes but that's it
want to clean code then you use this
want to clean code then you use this
right you use our stuff we have the

learning today
I want things I can hack in well puffer
I want things I can hack in well puffer
is very easy to hack because it is very

short by
puffer exactly they make it hard puer we
puffer exactly they make it hard puer we
make it
make it
easy why do difficult thing when easy
easy why do difficult thing when easy
thing just is
good for
so now this
so now this
works and the only thing I really need
works and the only thing I really need
to figure out is how to make this robust
to figure out is how to make this robust
to different um value prediction
to different um value prediction
Horizons that's all I need to sort
out e
oops I missed some messages it looks
like
e e
okay we'll see how this
okay we'll see how this
goes they're kind of two things that
goes they're kind of two things that
could happen here right one is that this
could happen here right one is that this
just doesn't work as well when you
just doesn't work as well when you
increase the Horizon uh but what I'm
increase the Horizon uh but what I'm
hoping is that there's just like a
hoping is that there's just like a
startup period That's longer while it
startup period That's longer while it
figures out how to adjust the effective
figures out how to adjust the effective
Horizon
okay I'm trying to think if there's any
okay I'm trying to think if there's any
reason why it would be fundamentally
reason why it would be fundamentally
harder with longer
harder with longer
Horizon I don't think
so I wouldn't think so I play the
so I wouldn't think so I play the
opposite it should be
better why is it not better
increasing Horizon should Grant more
capacity doesn't seem to though
it could just be the advantage function
it could just be the advantage function
being
silly if we're looking at initialization
silly if we're looking at initialization
versus Advantage
function probably Advantage function is
function probably Advantage function is
the place to look
the place to look
right
yeah e
Captain these are both G these are both
Captain these are both G these are both
no G right here
the only thing we haven't figured out
the only thing we haven't figured out
yet is how to make it robust when you
yet is how to make it robust when you
have longer value prediction
have longer value prediction
Horizons what made it so much faster
Horizons what made it so much faster
hyper pram sweeps we had to redo
hyper pram sweeps we had to redo
hyperparameter
optimization I mean we still have to
optimization I mean we still have to
do yeah I know it's huge
do yeah I know it's huge
right the thing is we still have to do
right the thing is we still have to do
like major major experimentation but
like major major experimentation but
this is what I'm saying like if you want
this is what I'm saying like if you want
to get involved with the experiment side
to get involved with the experiment side
I'm fixing
I'm fixing
RL like this is not like little like
RL like this is not like little like
shitty research we are actually going to
shitty research we are actually going to
fix RL this
fix RL this
year right like literally as soon as you

point puffer lip in the general
point puffer lip in the general
direction of something and you do
direction of something and you do
research at this speed with like any
research at this speed with like any
degree of competence stuff
solved I mean literally if you were
solved I mean literally if you were
running this on uh on cleanar you would
running this on uh on cleanar you would
be waiting weeks for these
be waiting weeks for these
results sp3 weeks for these results you
results sp3 weeks for these results you
wouldn't even be able to implement the
wouldn't even be able to implement the
thing as easily because like you'd have
thing as easily because like you'd have
to go dig through sp3 algorithm code
puffer very
good got to go now you let me know when
good got to go now you let me know when
you're around I briefed Spencer
already whenever you want to get
already whenever you want to get
involved we'll be here
for
e e
okay so this is very nice and
okay so this is very nice and
stable um it underperforms
stable um it underperforms
majorly we're going to figure out why
majorly we're going to figure out why
why
yeah so okay this is a nice stable curve
yeah so okay this is a nice stable curve
it's just there's like some noise or
it's just there's like some noise or
something so we'll figure this out
next so
um
yeah the next thing I would like to
do is we will compare this run
do
this so we are setting the scale to
this so we are setting the scale to
zero Beyond 32 and we see what this
zero Beyond 32 and we see what this
changes
I don't know this guy
so still lagging
so still lagging
right now the question I have is is this
right now the question I have is is this
going to be on par with the
going to be on par with the
original or
original or
not looks like it's a bit steep steeper
not looks like it's a bit steep steeper
but it's very
early so essentially here right
early so essentially here right
if this doesn't work if this works on
if this doesn't work if this works on
par with this then the error is coming
par with this then the error is coming
from the NL law
from the NL law
somehow and if it does work then we're
somehow and if it does work then we're
set and if it's in between then I don't
set and if it's in between then I don't
know
welcome
folks this
is evening algorithm
is evening algorithm
Dev and mostly a bunch of
experiments
experiments
H we'll see what this is on par with
so I've had results before where it
so I've had results before where it
doesn't seem like doing this alone fixes
doesn't seem like doing this alone fixes
the
the
problem so if that were the
case if that were the
case then the only other place the
case then the only other place the
problem can come from is the NL loss
right okay so you know what we'll do
right okay so you know what we'll do
next
next
is we will uh we'll mask the
is we will uh we'll mask the
loss so if this doesn't give us on power
loss so if this doesn't give us on power
performance we'll mask the loss and that
performance we'll mask the loss and that
should have to give us onar
performance and then maybe we'll do it
performance and then maybe we'll do it
the other way around so we mask uh one
the other way around so we mask uh one
and not the
and not the
other so this just
crashed weird
so we have a
plan e
this looks like it's going to be on par
here I unfortunately we do need to do
here I unfortunately we do need to do
the whole runs on
the whole runs on
these they are slow
these they are slow
I'd really like to know about this 34%
though presumably I just have to find a
though presumably I just have to find a
way to make the scyon
faster it's fine though we're
chilling I guess I can just think about
chilling I guess I can just think about
some plant for this
so I don't think it's going to be be
so I don't think it's going to be be
quite time to merge this yet I still
quite time to merge this yet I still
want to test the hyper Prim
want to test the hyper Prim
sweeps independently not on
this
this
yeah so we're going to refine the hyper
yeah so we're going to refine the hyper
pram sweep
pram sweep
stuff a little
stuff a little
bit breakout seems like a very good end
bit breakout seems like a very good end
for biddings with stuff
trains pretty
trains pretty
fast sweeps don't take too long
fast sweeps don't take too long
anymore so probably I'm going to play
anymore so probably I'm going to play
with the last remaining things that I
with the last remaining things that I
wanted to play with on hyper pram sweeps
wanted to play with on hyper pram sweeps
over
over
there and
there and
then we'll probably start running
then we'll probably start running
benchmarks
benchmarks
on well we'll merge that into this in
on well we'll merge that into this in
parallel we'll start running sweeps on
parallel we'll start running sweeps on
both for all the different MS
both for all the different MS
I think the new sweep algorithm is
I think the new sweep algorithm is
efficient enough we probably don't need
efficient enough we probably don't need
200 experiments per end probably only
200 experiments per end probably only
need
100 that'll also give us good evidence
100 that'll also give us good evidence
on this algorithm
what would it imply if this is slightly
what would it imply if this is slightly
above the other
one the nll
loss oh if this is slightly above the
loss oh if this is slightly above the
other one it just implies that at least
other one it just implies that at least
some small amount of the
some small amount of the
of the performance drop is attributable
of the performance drop is attributable
to the computation of the advantage
to the computation of the advantage
function that's all that
implies
yeah which would make
yeah which would make
sense and then NL is the other part of
sense and then NL is the other part of
it but the thing is I don't know how we
it but the thing is I don't know how we
fix
fix
NL like why would that be a
NL like why would that be a
problem why would Computing an NL loss
problem why would Computing an NL loss
over
over
more was it gaan negative log likelihood
more was it gaan negative log likelihood
why would Computing that
why would Computing that
over larger
over larger
sample create more error I don't think
sample create more error I don't think
that's how the law should work
knowing I still have to run the full
knowing I still have to run the full
thing for the end state
thing for the end state
but how's this going in the
meantime
meantime
oo 334 in 100
oo 334 in 100
seconds for reference this is about how
seconds for reference this is about how
well um original like sp3 and clean ARL
well um original like sp3 and clean ARL
does in I think an hour or two
get a nice burrito front
here burrito
optimal for the folks watching
optimal for the folks watching
all this is on
all this is on
puff. including the latest commits all
puff. including the latest commits all
the dev branches are public you can play
the dev branches are public you can play
with all this uh the results right as
with all this uh the results right as
they come
out start the repo if you do really
out start the repo if you do really
helps me
out pretty much I just track stars on
out pretty much I just track stars on
the repo and kind of X
the repo and kind of X
followers it's pretty much it
followers it's pretty much it
for growth of puffer
lib reason I have to wait for this whole
lib reason I have to wait for this whole
thing is because the end State sometimes
thing is because the end State sometimes
it can jump up at the end quite a
bit this one looks to have been pretty
bit this one looks to have been pretty
stable oh no we get the spike at the end
stable oh no we get the spike at the end
a little bit
650 it's about on par with this one
here so next we mask uh the
nlll for
what
what
happened in
it's other way
it's other way
around
around
32 there we go
so this should be identical to the
so this should be identical to the
original
run this is meant as a like a hard check
run this is meant as a like a hard check
on the horizon if something screw is
on the horizon if something screw is
happening
cuz now I have Horizon 128 but I have
cuz now I have Horizon 128 but I have
everything masked to be the same as uh
everything masked to be the same as uh
as
as
32 so if this doesn't
work and yeah some just really
work and yeah some just really
screwy and then that's most likely just
screwy and then that's most likely just
a bug so we just have to go hunt the
bug given that it looks like there is
bug given that it looks like there is
one we can start looking for
it okay the first 32 elements and this
it okay the first 32 elements and this
is a mean
is a mean
so
so
oh you're stupid
be really careful with these
things you make dumb mistakes well at
things you make dumb mistakes well at
least I make dumb mistakes when I've
least I make dumb mistakes when I've
been doing this
been doing this
for know most of the day
that's more like
it I still don't know if this will
it I still don't know if this will
match we will see
oh you know
what could that have been
it if I took the mean over the
loss it could literally be a scaling
loss it could literally be a scaling
issue right
let's see what this does before we make
let's see what this does before we make
any conclusion on that but it could
any conclusion on that but it could
literally be a scaling
issue if most of the signal is in the
issue if most of the signal is in the
first spot of the like the first chunk
first spot of the like the first chunk
of the loss and we take a
in and wouldn't think it should be some
in and wouldn't think it should be some
over the last Dimension though right
over the last Dimension though right
that would be
weird but think about
it it sucks that there's hardly any any
it it sucks that there's hardly any any
RL news on X anymore like everybody's
RL news on X anymore like everybody's
just gone and done llms
h
that's
funny where's the
RL if only people had AR Tech this is
RL if only people had AR Tech this is
like a fun gimmick it would be so easy
like a fun gimmick it would be so easy
to get RL working on an end like
to get RL working on an end like
this it's a fun gimmick but these don't
this it's a fun gimmick but these don't
actually you know these
actually you know these
D like nobody's going to like look at a
D like nobody's going to like look at a
thing through their phone and be like oh
thing through their phone and be like oh
wow it renders in 3D on my phone on the
camera we got 309 and 30
camera we got 309 and 30
that any
good oh yeah that looks on par with the
good oh yeah that looks on par with the
other
runs still have to run the whole damn
runs still have to run the whole damn
thing
but it could just be a whole scaling
issue question is what do we do if it is
issue question is what do we do if it is
a SC scaling
issue and why would it be a scaling
issue if you take a me
it's
like what do you do instead you take a
some a Thum doesn't work either that's
some a Thum doesn't work either that's
still doesn't scale
perfectly I want to fiddle with the
perfectly I want to fiddle with the
scales a little bit
there's so many versions of this to
run that's got to just be drift right
run that's got to just be drift right
that's showing up is
that's showing up is
better yeah it can't possibly just be
better yeah it can't possibly just be
better it's the same thing as
better it's the same thing as
before yeah there you go it's just some
before yeah there you go it's just some
Drift But if it's on par
Drift But if it's on par
and then we'll have to just figure out
and then we'll have to just figure out
if it's scaling or
what if it is
scaling it can't be credit assignment
scaling it can't be credit assignment
right
no there really should be no
no there really should be no
way for that loss to be messed
up unless it's a network capacity issue
up unless it's a network capacity issue
but I don't think that makes sense
but I don't think that makes sense
here oh here's a
here oh here's a
dip but this is not uncommon right the
dip but this is not uncommon right the
other experiment dipped as well that's
other experiment dipped as well that's
not I mean that's not a killer here it's
not I mean that's not a killer here it's
already back up
yeah there you
go
e e
I'm going to call this curve a match
I'm going to call this curve a match
because this one bump is like common and
because this one bump is like common and
the end Point's the same the general
the end Point's the same the general
shape is the
same and make sure the end Point's
same and make sure the end Point's
actually the
actually the
same I do wonder what it is that causes
same I do wonder what it is that causes
this type of thing though right it's
this type of thing though right it's
like temporary policy collapse and
like temporary policy collapse and
rebound this can't just be random noise
rebound this can't just be random noise
this is too big for random noise random
this is too big for random noise random
noise is on the scale of like these
noise is on the scale of like these
little jaggies you see here this is like
little jaggies you see here this is like
genuine
collapse is this collapsed back
again now we're
good okay that's the repo with 128 with
good okay that's the repo with 128 with
everything
everything
masked provided this is not going to
masked provided this is not going to
screw up
screw up
here I mean even still it's like it's
here I mean even still it's like it's
there so we're good so
now okay so this is this is
the this is the
the this is the
Repro and then we'll do this will just
Repro and then we'll do this will just
be mean of zero
do
do
sum over
32 so we're going to try this
32 so we're going to try this
one so this is going to take the same
one so this is going to take the same
scale and basically just assume that the
scale and basically just assume that the
last elements don't contribute
anything it's probably not a great
assumption is there a vloss norm on
here there is no Norm on
here there is no Norm on
vloss there's a
vloss there's a
clip and not a
norm norming value law seems fine
oh yeah that's a full solve 864 is fully
solved we're not expecting this to
solved we're not expecting this to
match we're just expecting this to do
match we're just expecting this to do
something in
between okay
so exciting
it's
it's
slower again all this has to do is land
slower again all this has to do is land
in the
middle and then if this does land in the
middle and then if this does land in the
middle then what we do is we take some
middle then what we do is we take some
sort of
normalization and we throw some
normalization and we throw some
normalization on
it6
see
for e
all
okay that's
something we still have to do this
something we still have to do this
without the clipping and then if
without the clipping and then if
if this all works then it's just pure
if this all works then it's just pure
normalization is the
normalization is the
issue there might still have to be some
issue there might still have to be some
clipping we'll
see but essentially if we're able to
see but essentially if we're able to
match it means that we should be able to
match it means that we should be able to
have it should be Horizon independent
have it should be Horizon independent
you should be able to give it a longer
you should be able to give it a longer
Horizon it'll either do the same or will
Horizon it'll either do the same or will
do
better CU longer Horizon environments
better CU longer Horizon environments
will make use of more of of the value
function e
it's flattened
it's flattened
out we'll see terminal

fiddle with
still this curve is a little
still this curve is a little
weird it was matching
it slow
it slow
down well again we didn't expect to be
down well again we didn't expect to be
perfect so that's kind of okay
the only thing we need to do is to be
the only thing we need to do is to be
better than the bottom set of

nobody told me
nobody told me
about this is very very close so I'll
about this is very very close so I'll
call this a
call this a

there isn't an exploit on the absolute

light there's nothing that goes
faster damn it I was hoping you were
faster damn it I was hoping you were
going to tell me there's a loophole
okay this is very
close you got me
excited I would love the speed of light
loophole see because there if there is
loophole see because there if there is
any sort of speed of light
any sort of speed of light
loophole I bet that we're going to be

able to have like faster than light
able to have like faster than light
travel and stuff and that would be
travel and stuff and that would be
pretty cool
pretty cool
we get to have some sci-fi
stuff if you can produce anyim
stuff if you can produce anyim
matter make an engine that gets close to
matter make an engine that gets close to
the speed of
light you would feel no
light you would feel no
time yeah but then you would get the
time yeah but then you would get the
like shitty version of sci-fi right in
like shitty version of sci-fi right in
which like you don't feel any time pass
which like you don't feel any time pass
but everybody else feels years of time
pass that's like the shitty sci-fi vers
now we want the Sci-Fi version where it
now we want the Sci-Fi version where it
just freaking works and uh you and then
just freaking works and uh you and then
we can just like hop all over the
we can just like hop all over the
universe whenever we want that's the
universe whenever we want that's the
cool
one don't think I can crack that one
one don't think I can crack that one
yeah we'll wait for AI to crack that
one I think ai's got to delete has got
one I think ai's got to delete has got
to deliver us at least one crazy sci-fi
to deliver us at least one crazy sci-fi
thing before we really take get too
thing before we really take get too
seriously we at least have it has to
seriously we at least have it has to
give us like one crazy thing straight
give us like one crazy thing straight
out of sci-fi
well hopefully not that
well hopefully not that
sci-fi I'm thinking more um you know
sci-fi I'm thinking more um you know
culture series or
something e
I need to
I need to
focus
focus
well you don't take it too
seriously the thing is it's possible now
seriously the thing is it's possible now
is pretty boring you got to give
is pretty boring you got to give
something you got to have something to
something you got to have something to
get you to get up in the morning right
well as you can see I am here doing the
work would we like to check the number
work would we like to check the number
of Dev hours streamed this
of Dev hours streamed this
month it's quite a lot
two major breakthroughs this
month e
see if this is a little
less I wonder if we should also try this
less I wonder if we should also try this
with the
clipping the clipping should be the same
clipping the clipping should be the same
shouldn't
shouldn't
it I mean I guess we'll look at
it I mean I guess we'll look at
it clipping should be the
same want to try that as well a lot of
same want to try that as well a lot of
just manual experiments
today when it's for something this big I
today when it's for something this big I
don't mind it
sh
how big of a
how big of a
jump so let's say that it performs
jump so let's say that it performs
exactly the same as generalized
exactly the same as generalized
Advantage estimation okay let's say that
Advantage estimation okay let's say that
that's the bar that we get it to work
that's the bar that we get it to work
exactly as well as the previous
exactly as well as the previous
one you
one you
add you just make your existing you
add you just make your existing you
change this form of your existing loss
change this form of your existing loss
terms you make the loss
terms you make the loss
layer bigger but that should be
layer bigger but that should be
essentially free and you delete two very
essentially free and you delete two very
fiddly hyper parameters from the
algorithm you no longer have to sweep
algorithm you no longer have to sweep
two hyper parameters
that's the cool
thing no it doesn't cut down the compute
thing no it doesn't cut down the compute
on a 1 million parameter run it cuts
on a 1 million parameter run it cuts
down the hyperparameter search so that
down the hyperparameter search so that
means a few things first of all you have
means a few things first of all you have
to run fewer experiments in order to get
to run fewer experiments in order to get
optimal hyper parameters and second it
optimal hyper parameters and second it
is much much more likely that you will
is much much more likely that you will
able be able to use the same hyper
able be able to use the same hyper
parameters across many different
parameters across many different
environments and have it perform quite
environments and have it perform quite
well out of the
box so this would be a large step
box so this would be a large step
forward for out of the box reinforcement
learning pong to other games may be pong
learning pong to other games may be pong
to other Sims
entirely you cut out I think it
entirely you cut out I think it
the probably the second and the third
the probably the second and the third
most fiddly hyper parameters in
most fiddly hyper parameters in
RL so you cut out two of the top
RL so you cut out two of the top
three you know most annoying hyper
three you know most annoying hyper
parameters in
RL yep
gamma
Lambda you can tune a hyper parameter
Lambda you can tune a hyper parameter
but you can't tune a

I saw one
I saw one
snorkeling like uh a month month and a
snorkeling like uh a month month and a
half
ago they're very amusing
okay so this is better than the other
okay so this is better than the other
ones but

clipping we'll try clipping
next I was on vacation I wasn't
next I was on vacation I wasn't

technically find some manties though

that would be
that would be
cool but I can also literally just like

take a 30 second walk outside and just
take a 30 second walk outside and just
see alligators just chilling by the side
see alligators just chilling by the side

this is a bot up
it's
funny just
want 120
mil my question is is this going to
mil my question is is this going to
track the previous run or is this going
track the previous run or is this going
to track this one up
to track this one up
here I would think that it should have
here I would think that it should have
to track the one up there with the
to track the one up there with the
clipping we will see though
I think I'd argue that this is actually
I think I'd argue that this is actually
simpler to implement than
simpler to implement than
um the original po as
well generalized Advantage estimation is
well generalized Advantage estimation is
really awkward to
really awkward to
implement this is a lot easier I'd say
would you ever try Fugu no leave the
would you ever try Fugu no leave the
puffers
alone leave the puffer fish
alone leave the puffer fish
alone they're very friendly

this here
don't think there's any great way I can
don't think there's any great way I can
always optimize the
C e
this freaking
it's funny
this is honestly true
though oh but somebody reused this
picture there was a post on this earlier
picture there was a post on this earlier
that yeah like if you go anywhere with
that yeah like if you go anywhere with
SF you can just get a house like a 1K
SF you can just get a house like a 1K
mortgage on it
just build whatever the hell you
want would you ever go
want would you ever go
where to somewhere in the middle of
where to somewhere in the middle of
nowhere instead of SF I'm current l in
Florida not exactly the tech capital of
Florida not exactly the tech capital of
the world but I'm building whatever
right uh I've been there I don't plan on
right uh I've been there I don't plan on
going
going

back it's kind of just a shitty and
dangerous city at the moment
I don't know how many more Founders have

it's like yeah this is just a stupid
it's like yeah this is just a stupid
place to
be I'll be spending a good chunk of the

summer and Paulo Alto
instead 45 minutes south safe nice
cleaner
cleaner
y now Pao Alto is nice Mountain View is
y now Pao Alto is nice Mountain View is
nice I mean honestly a whole bunch of
nice I mean honestly a whole bunch of
areas are
nice okay so I'm interested to know
why why this didn't match
well let it finish to be sure but it
well let it finish to be sure but it
doesn't seem like it
matches
e e
so the fact that that doesn't mitigate
so the fact that that doesn't mitigate
is kind of
weird

uh particular experiments were running
uh particular experiments were running
right now could be a particularly major
right now could be a particularly major
breakthrough let's say
this would be
this would be
a well the first general purpose
a well the first general purpose

2017 he goes through the

oh hang on there's just a ton of

there yeah I'm looking at this thing
now I think there might just be a ton of
now I think there might just be a ton of

I know I've never been super big on
uh chain of command well I guess I
uh chain of command well I guess I
wouldn't it's not we don't have any

there's not really a chain of command or
there's not really a chain of command or
anything
I mean there's a don't be a dick rule
right Hulse power

the capacitor and it's like a single use
the capacitor and it's like a single use
thing or
I'm just trying to figure how does it
I'm just trying to figure how does it
work if to recharge it you need to

C4 is that a

you use
RL that'd be a fun thing to work on to

honest we should do that we should do I
honest we should do that we should do I
mean I could even sci-fi it a little bit
mean I could even sci-fi it a little bit
up and I could just make like a
up and I could just make like a
swarm ship Sim that'd be
fun big
money oh yeah of
course if my primary goal were money I
course if my primary goal were money I
wouldn't be doing this at least not in
wouldn't be doing this at least not in
the way that I'm doing
the way that I'm doing
it it is a goal but it is the secondary

money will

come money will come
how do I get on get in on this swarm Sim
how do I get on get in on this swarm Sim
that's the thing you literally just
that's the thing you literally just
start doing stuff you just start
start doing stuff you just start
building
stuff there's no gatekeeping here here
stuff there's no gatekeeping here here
I'll show you one

okay
okay
so here I built this

contributors who showed up and were like
contributors who showed up and were like
hey I want to build a thing how about
hey I want to build a thing how about
this and I said go for it and then I
this and I said go for it and then I
just you know gave input along the way
just you know gave input along the way
and
and
helped but yeah literally you just start
helped but yeah literally you just start
building
building
Sims and then puffer makes it
fast we have all the resources you need
fast we have all the resources you need
on this
on this
stuff it's much easier than it
looks you don't even you don't have to
looks you don't even you don't have to
do like complicated like you don't have
do like complicated like you don't have
to even do like physics Sim at the level
to even do like physics Sim at the level
of the propellers and like the air flow
of the propellers and like the air flow
and all that like literally if you just
and all that like literally if you just
did uh like ships in 3D space having to
did uh like ships in 3D space having to
like coordinate to do a thing
like coordinate to do a thing
effectively
effectively
yeah I mean this is pretty much how it
yeah I mean this is pretty much how it
works right I get dozens and dozens of
works right I get dozens and dozens of
people asking me like how I get involved
people asking me like how I get involved
in RL I tell everybody look you
in RL I tell everybody look you
literally just show up and build these
literally just show up and build these
Sims and then the ones who stick around
Sims and then the ones who stick around
become you know active contributors and
become you know active contributors and
uh they get Hardware access active
uh they get Hardware access active
contributors get access to our hardware
contributors get access to our hardware
and I do code reviews and you know they
and I do code reviews and you know they
get a lot of good
information hey I invest time in people
information hey I invest time in people
who invest time and puffer that's how
who invest time and puffer that's how
the open source
the open source
works it is remarkably remarkably easy
works it is remarkably remarkably easy
to get involved you just put in a little
to get involved you just put in a little
bit of the
time ultimately we want this to be a
time ultimately we want this to be a
quality open source stuff just need
quality open source stuff just need
people building these environments and
people building these environments and
testing stuff actually two of the
testing stuff actually two of the
contributors now have done so much stuff
contributors now have done so much stuff
on Puffer that I'll be onboarding them
on Puffer that I'll be onboarding them
onto some of the more science side stuff
onto some of the more science side stuff
that I do done one onboarding already
sour is very good
this one I don't entirely
understand like does this just work I
understand like does this just work I
doubt this works right this is probably
unstable not some
yeah that's unstable
right you can see the value
loss
e e
that's
tiny open source waiting on first
tiny open source waiting on first
citation did you just publish
this oh you have a few you have
several I don't even have the Google
several I don't even have the Google
Scholar profile I'm pretty sure
February 1
congrats
e
e e
no bil's published RL in the field yeah
no bil's published RL in the field yeah
rl's hard
well it depends what the search
well it depends what the search
Dimension

is I can probably do better than genetic
and the value lost like
this
e e
there's a value clip but there's no
there's a value clip but there's no
value Norm it looks like
genetic algorithms are much easier to
genetic algorithms are much easier to
get working than to than RL which is why
get working than to than RL which is why
a lot of people just start with them but
a lot of people just start with them but
they don't work anywhere near as
they don't work anywhere near as
well like they're easier to implement
well like they're easier to implement
but they don't work anywhere near as
but they don't work anywhere near as
well
yeah there's no Norm just a
clip e
oh you know
oh you know
what I wonder if it's just
um wonder if it's just
um wonder if it's just
this no I wouldn't think so honestly but
this no I wouldn't think so honestly but
maybe
this could be
it numerical gun doesn't know RL
the thing about yet is you can know the
the thing about yet is you can know the
math way better than I do and the

engineering will still bite you
let's see how this goes cuz I think I

maybe this doesn't seem like it matches
maybe this doesn't seem like it matches
the YOLO curve here
but run this I'm going to set up the

power itself is defined as energy

the engineering of taking and
the engineering of taking and
accumulating energy over a longer
accumulating energy over a longer
