Hi.
So, I got a bunch of administrative
So, I got a bunch of administrative
stuff to do today. I got to like get
stuff to do today. I got to like get
ready for this conference. So, I figured
ready for this conference. So, I figured
I would stream. We'll just kind of chill
I would stream. We'll just kind of chill
and uh I'm going to be making the poster
and uh I'm going to be making the poster
on stream. I'll answer whatever the heck
on stream. I'll answer whatever the heck
people want to chat about with RL. We'll
people want to chat about with RL. We'll
have a decent time.
have a decent time.
So, uh, I just found
So, uh, I just found
I got the size for the poster 6 ft x 4T,
I got the size for the poster 6 ft x 4T,
but I can't actually find the old puffer
but I can't actually find the old puffer
lip poster, which is kind of annoying.
lip poster, which is kind of annoying.
So, kind of just going to make something
So, kind of just going to make something
super quick and hope that it's uh decent
super quick and hope that it's uh decent
enough.
think if I should just do it in Google
think if I should just do it in Google
Slides. I probably should, right?
You don't get something that's like as
You don't get something that's like as
nice, but you get something a lot
nice, but you get something a lot
quicker.
quicker.
Oh, hang on. No, I did find it. Wait,
Oh, hang on. No, I did find it. Wait,
I literally just looked at this off
I literally just looked at this off
tried to find this off stream for a
tried to find this off stream for a
while and I couldn't find it and then I
while and I couldn't find it and then I
found it immediately here. Okay, so this
found it immediately here. Okay, so this
was the old poster.
Yeah, we've gone a long way since here.
We can do better than this.
We can do better than this.
We can definitely do better than this.
We can definitely do better than this.
So,
and we have so much more stuff now
and we have so much more stuff now
actually, don't we?
actually, don't we?
Ner's 2023.
Ner's 2023.
Two years.
Okay. So, let's just start with
Okay. So, let's just start with
something.
offer a lab.
offer a lab.
Or else
could be they say 6 feet by 4 feet,
could be they say 6 feet by 4 feet,
uh by 48. Just that right
background color.
put our puffers somewhere.
Actually, you're supposed to leave some
Actually, you're supposed to leave some
margin, right?
One will be vertical at
One will be vertical at
uh what like inch or two you margin.
Then
Then
one
in
I don't know why I do this stuff myself.
I don't know why I do this stuff myself.
I really should just find like a good
I really should just find like a good
designer to just do this stuff like not
designer to just do this stuff like not
but it's actually very difficult to like
but it's actually very difficult to like
find people who you can just go a do
find people who you can just go a do
make something good
make something good
don't need like almost as much direction
don't need like almost as much direction
as time it would take me anyways
but
we have new logos and stuff uh since
we have new logos and stuff uh since
then.
then.
So, this is obviously going to be like
So, this is obviously going to be like
way bigger.
I got to go figure out what fonts that
I got to go figure out what fonts that
we uh typically use. Now, what do I have
we uh typically use. Now, what do I have
on the website
up reinforcement learning?
Is that really all we have on the site?
Is that really all we have on the site?
I thought we did um
Okay. Yeah, I forgot I made this the uh
Okay. Yeah, I forgot I made this the uh
the thing. Okay, so we have a few
the thing. Okay, so we have a few
different ideas.
Oh yeah, this is also tiny here. Let me
Oh yeah, this is also tiny here. Let me
make this a reasonable size for stream
make this a reasonable size for stream
better.
What did I call this paper anyways?
Reinforcement learning at a million
Reinforcement learning at a million
steps per second.
Uh, it is reinforc.
This is more appropriate for a side. I
This is more appropriate for a side. I
think we just do fast insane
think we just do fast insane
horsemen.
or do I have to do I think maybe we
or do I have to do I think maybe we
stick closer to the title.
I think this is closer to the uh the
I think this is closer to the uh the
title of the accepted paper.
I'll put 3 0 on here as well. Even
I'll put 3 0 on here as well. Even
though the paper was 20, I think that's
though the paper was 20, I think that's
reasonable that we basically discuss.
reasonable that we basically discuss.
We'll just present what I did in uh in 3
We'll just present what I did in uh in 3
0. Well, we'll present what I did in 2,
0. Well, we'll present what I did in 2,
but we'll like update it because some
but we'll like update it because some
stuff is no longer
stuff is no longer
as relevant, right?
So, something like this.
This was funny as hell. Sorry, I'll have
This was funny as hell. Sorry, I'll have
you all put
Let's just do this around the uh the
Let's just do this around the uh the
text, I'd say.
Yeah, let's do this around the uh the
Yeah, let's do this around the uh the
text.
So, I just need to come up with
So, I just need to come up with
I never do my posters like um most of
I never do my posters like um most of
the ones at conferences that just have a
the ones at conferences that just have a
billion paragraphs of text. I think you
billion paragraphs of text. I think you
get like three sentences for a poster.
Let me see if I can keep them a little
Let me see if I can keep them a little
bit closer to what I did in 20
fish and broadly compatible simulation.
fish and broadly compatible simulation.
So I did first party environments.
I can do
I can do
first party environment speed and then
first party environment speed and then
the new algorithm stuff we'll put like
the new algorithm stuff we'll put like
third or whatever and it'll be like hey
third or whatever and it'll be like hey
of 30.
Maybe we'll do it that way. Hey YouTube
Maybe we'll do it that way. Hey YouTube
folks, we're kind of just chilling and
folks, we're kind of just chilling and
making a poster for a little bit today.
making a poster for a little bit today.
Happy to chat about RL while I do this
Happy to chat about RL while I do this
and whatever else. Um but yeah, the plan
and whatever else. Um but yeah, the plan
for today is hopefully do this. I might
for today is hopefully do this. I might
have to update my business cards and
have to update my business cards and
other crap as well. I figure I'd just
other crap as well. I figure I'd just
hang out on stream and um if I finish
hang out on stream and um if I finish
this quickly, we will do some actual RL
this quickly, we will do some actual RL
later.
later.
I got to add like a feature to Puffer
I got to add like a feature to Puffer

suggestions. I suck at this.

I kind of just do it anyways.
I don't think I suck as badly as most of
I don't think I suck as badly as most of
the posters at the very least though cuz

most of the posters are like 10

Okay. So, X that we want.
Hey, welcome. How's it going?
Do you watch R?
Do you watch R?
No, my guy. I watch like nothing.
Let me see what we do next. So, um

I will link this for you.
This is all my best advice in one place.

I wrote this specifically because I get

that question so often.
And the answer is not to lean more
And the answer is not to lean more
heavily into AI.
Okay. So, we do something like this.
Okay. So, we do something like this.
Yeah.
So, we'll do like
So, we'll do like
this is going to take up a whole bunch
this is going to take up a whole bunch
of space.
I kind of like the idea of having um
like this like this
like this or something.
Yeah, something. And your name is

We have this.
Uh, let's go grab placeholder so I leave

I'm going to have to have this
I'm going to have to have this

So, this is my business card at the

them. preparing presentation. No, no,
them. preparing presentation. No, no,
no, no. This is the poster. Okay, so
no, no. This is the poster. Okay, so
this thing here, this is just me like
this thing here, this is just me like
slamming together a poster real quick.
Yeah, you're right. I also have to do a
Yeah, you're right. I also have to do a
presentation, but I need the poster done
presentation, but I need the poster done
first cuz I have to get that printed.
Oh, I can literally just grab all these
Oh, I can literally just grab all these
images, can't I?
images, can't I?
And just like collage them.
Single super cool. No, we can't just put
Single super cool. No, we can't just put
like one end. The point is to show that
like one end. The point is to show that
we have all the different stuff, right?
If it were like it would be a if I were

it would be that right but I I'm not.
it would be that right but I I'm not.
Okay. So let me do
Yeah, this will definitely then this
Yeah, this will definitely then this
will double as our um
Yeah, look at all these thumbnails I
Yeah, look at all these thumbnails I
have, right?
I should literally just be able to super
I should literally just be able to super
quick drag these in. Like make something
quick drag these in. Like make something
cool, you know?
consider using Canva. I'm not a

Crazy not to use all this stuff, right?
So, actually, this this ends up pretty

you only have control over like you've

So now I'm trying to think how much to
So now I'm trying to think how much to
what extent I want to just make a big
what extent I want to just make a big
collage
collage
versus
just do this right and just add in some
just do this right and just add in some
graphs or something down here.
Oh yeah, that is like that is so um
Oh yeah, that is like that is so um
that's so dated
and we like we're so much better than
and we like we're so much better than
this now.
Like we have stuff that's way way more
Like we have stuff that's way way more
complicated than this where the AI
complicated than this where the AI
actually works and it's like over 10,000
actually works and it's like over 10,000
times faster than this.
I mean, this was like the first thing I
I mean, this was like the first thing I
built when I was 20
built when I was 20
in RL.
I think we just make a big collage. No.
I think we just make a big collage. No.
And then leave some spot for some
And then leave some spot for some
graphs.
and like have a few spotlights.
Yeah, I hate I hate having to do
Yeah, I hate I hate having to do
posters, which is why we're kind of just
posters, which is why we're kind of just
doing something super quick now. Like I
doing something super quick now. Like I
don't have to actually waste my time
don't have to actually waste my time
doing posters like everyone else does.
This is like
I mean you have you have to kind of
I mean you have you have to kind of
realize as well that this is going to be
like this is going to be really big when
like this is going to be really big when
when we print it cuz this poster is
when we print it cuz this poster is
huge.
What what does Canva Can give me a

this easier with Canva?
Like I'm not a total [ __ ] with this,

Just like for something of this level,
Just like for something of this level,
it's not actually faster or easier.
Like this is very basic work.
I'm pretty sure just making your poster
I'm pretty sure just making your poster
AI gen is like a shooting offense.
I think you just get shot.
I think that's how it works, right?
I'm going to open this thing.
Okay, look. If you think it's this is
Okay, look. If you think it's this is
like a cool image, but like if you think
like a cool image, but like if you think
that this is a good idea to just have
that this is a good idea to just have
like an obviously AI gen poster that
like an obviously AI gen poster that
doesn't show any of your actual work
doesn't show any of your actual work
that you've done, you're crazy. Like the
that you've done, you're crazy. Like the
shooting offense.
What is this? Working on just the
What is this? Working on just the
poster. I gotta I gotta get a better
poster. I gotta I gotta get a better
Hang on. Let me get a a better drone
Hang on. Let me get a a better drone

I get one real quick.
It's bad enough that I do AI gen images
It's bad enough that I do AI gen images
for my articles. All right. Like that's
for my articles. All right. Like that's
bad enough.
I have the racing task set up.
I have the racing task set up.
Oh, this is pretty cool.
I can do this.
I think working on exploration

exploitation is a waste of time. Well, I
exploitation is a waste of time. Well, I
just I don't even know how you set that
just I don't even know how you set that
up, right?
up, right?
It's not that it's a waste of time. It's
It's not that it's a waste of time. It's
that it's so far outside of what we're
that it's so far outside of what we're
doing because like we train models task
doing because like we train models task
specific from scratch. So, how do you
specific from scratch. So, how do you
get general purpose data that is useful
get general purpose data that is useful
for, you know, whatever task we're
for, you know, whatever task we're
training on?
You see what I mean? Like, how like you
You see what I mean? Like, how like you
can't outline a concrete A to B to C to
can't outline a concrete A to B to C to
this like works, right?
So, you know, why don't I just like
So, you know, why don't I just like
literally take the time go crop this?
Can't let me crop.
Can't let me crop.
Of course, it doesn't let me crop. Why
Of course, it doesn't let me crop. Why
would it let me crop?

was the old poster.
Yeah, we've gone a long way since here.
We can do better than this.

I got to go figure out what fonts that

I thought we did um

What did I call this paper anyways?

So, this is my business card at the

no, no. This is the poster. Okay, so
no, no. This is the poster. Okay, so
this thing here, this is just me like
this thing here, this is just me like
slamming together a poster real quick.
Yeah, you're right. I also have to do a
Yeah, you're right. I also have to do a
presentation, but I need the poster done
presentation, but I need the poster done
first cuz I have to get that printed.
Oh, I can literally just grab all these
Oh, I can literally just grab all these
images, can't I?

And just like collage them.
Single super cool. No, we can't just put
Single super cool. No, we can't just put

If it were like it would be a if I were

Okay. So let me do
Yeah, this will definitely then this
Yeah, this will definitely then this
will double as our um
Yeah, look at all these thumbnails I
Yeah, look at all these thumbnails I
have, right?
I should literally just be able to super

versus
just do this right and just add in some
just do this right and just add in some

Oh yeah, that is like that is so um
Oh yeah, that is like that is so um
that's so dated
and we like we're so much better than

this now.
Like we have stuff that's way way more
Like we have stuff that's way way more
complicated than this where the AI
complicated than this where the AI
actually works and it's like over 10,000

I mean, this was like the first thing I
I mean, this was like the first thing I
built when I was 20
built when I was 20
in RL.
I think we just make a big collage. No.
I think we just make a big collage. No.
And then leave some spot for some

and like have a few spotlights.
Yeah, I hate I hate having to do
Yeah, I hate I hate having to do
posters, which is why we're kind of just
posters, which is why we're kind of just
doing something super quick now. Like I
doing something super quick now. Like I
don't have to actually waste my time
don't have to actually waste my time
doing posters like everyone else does.
This is like
I mean you have you have to kind of
I mean you have you have to kind of
realize as well that this is going to be
like this is going to be really big when
like this is going to be really big when
when we print it cuz this poster is

huge.

I'm pretty sure just making your poster

I think you just get shot.
I think that's how it works, right?
I'm going to open this thing.
Okay, look. If you think it's this is
