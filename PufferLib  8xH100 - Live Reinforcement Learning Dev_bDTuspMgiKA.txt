Hello. Where did my chat window
Hello. Where did my chat window
go? There we
are. So, we have some uh some

First of
all, this actually works perfectly
all, this actually works perfectly
fine. Nothing wrong with uh our sweeps

but it's it's fine.
but it's it's fine.
Now there is something wrong with our
Now there is something wrong with our
sweep our sweeping function

out I just want to figure out why it is

that the sweep did not find these

sweep. Let me try very quickly. I just
want to see how much worse it

gets. 16
Reason I want to rerun this is because
Reason I want to rerun this is because
it is possible that there's some quirk
it is possible that there's some quirk
where it's just very difficult for it to

works.
So, it could be that it just can't find
So, it could be that it just can't find
the small mini
the small mini
batches. We shall see.
Oh yeah, so far that is not really
Oh yeah, so far that is not really
learning.
See? Meanwhile
See? Meanwhile
though, our 200 run
though, our 200 run
example one the one that didn't work
example one the one that didn't work
super
well. I mean this actually does find
well. I mean this actually does find
like a few
like a few
runs at 8192.
It's most likely eval or something
It's most likely eval or something
weird, right?
what? Oh, no. This is a different one,
what? Oh, no. This is a different one,
right? Yeah, this is
different. This one
No, not this
one. This one.
I suspect that this is going to come
I suspect that this is going to come
down to differences
down to differences
uh minor differences made with this
uh minor differences made with this
sweep setup.
So this
So this
does not
reset that we do not reset and then we
reset that we do not reset and then we
do 32
do 32
updates. How this one
updates. How this one
goes. Uh now notably actually this is
goes. Uh now notably actually this is
doing pretty darn
doing pretty darn
well. So,
like that's I didn't expect that. Hang
on. Okay. Like it's not it's not
on. Okay. Like it's not it's not
anywhere near as good as
anywhere near as good as
this. But like this is still better than
this. But like this is still better than
we what we found in the other sweep. So
we what we found in the other sweep. So
it's not just mini batch size. It's not
it's not just mini batch size. It's not
just mini batch size as a parameter.
It's causing problems. I don't know why
It's causing problems. I don't know why
I have these on.
So, we don't reset and then we do 32
So, we don't reset and then we do 32
updates of
eval. Uh, that's like totally
fine. I down sample
Is there like a little spike at the end
Is there like a little spike at the end
or something
or something
weird that like messes with
it? See
anything? Sort of compare the uh the
anything? Sort of compare the uh the

behavior. One of the things that matters
is how the sweep finishes.
is how the sweep finishes.
So like uh this is the bad
So like uh this is the bad
one. Can we get this like small uptick
one. Can we get this like small uptick
maybe at the
maybe at the
end? Yeah, it looks like there's Well,
end? Yeah, it looks like there's Well,
it's not always an
it's not always an
uptick. Okay, but then like with this
uptick. Okay, but then like with this
one these things have the same
one these things have the same
thing. Kind of have the same like
thing. Kind of have the same like
tick a little bit more
tick a little bit more
flat. Oh, there's still like a change.
They're both like
They're both like
solid real time
closer. So I mean what causes that,
right?
suggestions per bare random
samples. They're all the same as they
were. Search center
on. Yeah, I have this
already. Okay. So, like
There very very few things then that
There very very few things then that
this could
this could
be could actually be different
be could actually be different
here. Not a lot
changed. I'm going to try it with
The

alt? Okay, so
alt? Okay, so
like Oh no, this has the last
Yeah. So, this actually
Yeah. So, this actually
has last. The only thing that this could
has last. The only thing that this could
be is the 10 samples. 10 samples versus
be is the 10 samples. 10 samples versus
five,
right? Can't think of anything
right? Can't think of anything
else. Let's SSH in and try
it. Didn't I do that in this sweep,
it. Didn't I do that in this sweep,
though? I thought that I tried that.
Make sure I didn't already do that. 200
Make sure I didn't already do that. 200
runs. Do like
this. Okay, we
this. Okay, we
change. Oh, we capped it at
change. Oh, we capped it at
288. That was probably pretty
stupid.
Could it literally just be the time
Could it literally just be the time
steps? Like if we capped a
steps? Like if we capped a
2E8 like it just did too many short
runs. I mean that's kind of jank if so,
runs. I mean that's kind of jank if so,
but
when I did grid
here. 5 E7 to
here. 5 E7 to
6E8. I mean, that's naturally going to
6E8. I mean, that's naturally going to
make it more aggressive at the start,
make it more aggressive at the start,
maybe.
We're going to try both of those
We're going to try both of those
changes. We'll see if that uh that
changes. We'll see if that uh that
recovers it or
not. The dispenser's container. My bad.
Okay. So, this is the
Okay. So, this is the
grid. This is 3.0 pre4. So, which is
grid. This is 3.0 pre4. So, which is
going to be the the one that we're
on. Ocean.

We don't care about
that. So, like, has this actually just
that. So, like, has this actually just
been fine?
5768. Well, then the only thing that
5768. Well, then the only thing that
this could possibly be
is this going from 10 to five,
is this going from 10 to five,
right? Maybe it needs 10 samples. I
right? Maybe it needs 10 samples. I
don't freaking know.
We're not going to have to run it for

So, I mean, we know from these things
So, I mean, we know from these things
now. We've got neural MMO 3. Actually, I
now. We've got neural MMO 3. Actually, I
haven't
haven't

ran. I should probably look at that real
quick. That's cool. Thank you.
quick. That's cool. Thank you.
I think so as
well. Okay. So
could have this guy
here currently
tracking. Little different actually from
tracking. Little different actually from
any of the other
curves. I don't mind leaving this on
curves. I don't mind leaving this on
overnight just
overnight just
running. See what it does.
The thing is we are totally at a point
The thing is we are totally at a point
where we should just be able to do like
where we should just be able to do like
a five bill
run. For whatever reason doesn't seem to
run. For whatever reason doesn't seem to
work super well.
Like what is
this? I wonder if there's an initial
this? I wonder if there's an initial
condition
problem. Like hang
problem. Like hang
on. If I just
Go look at these ones. This was the good
Go look at these ones. This was the good
one,
one,
right? I mean, there's like a first run
here. What was the first run?
take a few pages of
scrolling, but like I wonder if the
scrolling, but like I wonder if the
first run just was way better in this
first run just was way better in this
one for whatever
one for whatever
reason. No, they look the same,
right?
right?
Go up to 0 2 down a little bit. Yeah,
Go up to 0 2 down a little bit. Yeah,
very similar PF.
Not a first run
issue. If I go like eight of
issue. If I go like eight of
these, one of these actually does pretty
these, one of these actually does pretty
well. If I do like two pages of
these by 16 runs, no, it's actually
these by 16 runs, no, it's actually
still not like amazing.
Okay. So, you start to get runs like
Okay. So, you start to get runs like
when you get like 20 runs deep, you
when you get like 20 runs deep, you
start actually like getting some stuff
start actually like getting some stuff
that's not
that's not
terrible, but it's not great. That's
terrible, but it's not great. That's
really not great
really not great
either. So, I wonder if
either. So, I wonder if
um I wonder if it is literally just like
um I wonder if it is literally just like
the 10 samples versus five thing.
H bit irritating. If so, I definitely
H bit irritating. If so, I definitely
should have been more careful with uh
should have been more careful with uh
not breaking this benchmark because this
not breaking this benchmark because this
one is so good.
one is so good.
Like can we just take a moment here to
appreciate this
model? I forgot I did that.
Well, pull it at some
point
models. I'm trying to think what the
models. I'm trying to think what the
good like what a good plan is here.
good like what a good plan is here.
I think neural
I think neural
MMO3 is going to be a good target end
MMO3 is going to be a good target end
for testing DDP because it's got a

really long train curve that we know how
really long train curve that we know how

and then tomorrow when we get the

I guess I could go check in on Spencer

yard a potential fix. Let me go take a
yard a potential fix. Let me go take a
quick look.
Plasma. Oh, did Hrien reply?
Okay, so this guy's actually making more
Okay, so this guy's actually making more
M's as well. That's great.
So yeah, you kind of committed
So yeah, you kind of committed
uh different stuff in there, my
guy. That's fine. It's just voids
guy. That's fine. It's just voids
things. You should probably take a look
things. You should probably take a look
at the uh the new like go take a look at
at the uh the new like go take a look at
the code for the convert environment for
the code for the convert environment for
voids by the way. Like I figured that
voids by the way. Like I figured that
when I was doing that end like that
when I was doing that end like that
would also help you out a
bit. What on
earth that
I just had a hummingbird do the most
I just had a hummingbird do the most
bizarre aerial acrobatics display I've
bizarre aerial acrobatics display I've
ever
seen.
seen.
Okay. Cool things about having a bunch
Okay. Cool things about having a bunch
of wildlife outside the
window. But yeah, plasma, just check out
window. But yeah, plasma, just check out
um the convert environment. When I was
um the convert environment. When I was
writing it, I figured it would be a good
writing it, I figured it would be a good
reference for you as well. Like I knew
reference for you as well. Like I knew
you were already doing voids, but you're
you were already doing voids, but you're
having like a tough time getting stuff
having like a tough time getting stuff
to train. So I figured that would be a
to train. So I figured that would be a
good reference M. And we're all the for
good reference M. And we're all the for
reference, by the way, like we're going
reference, by the way, like we're going
to be doing a lot more swarming type M
to be doing a lot more swarming type M
soon. So that type of stuff is actually
soon. So that type of stuff is actually
quite
useful. Fix the voids.
Wait. Yo, how's this make any sense,
Wait. Yo, how's this make any sense,
man? Autotype is a function.
You passed a function
pointer, but that's not the type. This
pointer, but that's not the type. This
doesn't get called,
right? Type can take a
function.
Oh, I did not know that. Cool.
But it's still redundant,
right? Load is also a
function. Yeah, but that's cuz Python's
function. Yeah, but that's cuz Python's
a stupid language,
a stupid language,
right? Well, this this has this check in
right? Well, this this has this check in
here, right? So you it would just be
here, right? So you it would just be
autotype, wouldn't it?
this fully fix it. I'm trying to think
Well, I'll merge this for now. So, thank
Well, I'll merge this for now. So, thank
you. I might make some changes to
you. I might make some changes to
it to 3L. Thank
you. Any reason not to?
you. Any reason not to?
Thank you for
that. Okay, so this is definitely not
that. Okay, so this is definitely not
the same here cuz I just had 16
runs and I didn't get a single good run.
runs and I didn't get a single good run.
Whereas like over
here, this is like 16 runs and I'm
here, this is like 16 runs and I'm
already getting like this. You can see
already getting like this. You can see
it's dramatically
it's dramatically
different. So
different. So
what what is possibly different here?
You got to be a little careful with that
You got to be a little careful with that
like so that the way you convert is not
like so that the way you convert is not
rounding floats to
ins. You could very easily cause a lot
ins. You could very easily cause a lot
of problems with
that. If you like are rounding float
that. If you like are rounding float
parameters to int
parameters to int

mistake. I have no idea, man. Why Why do
mistake. I have no idea, man. Why Why do
you think I would know like dumb Python
you think I would know like dumb Python
details? Does this work? No. Look at
that. Okay. Okay. But like if you try if
that. Okay. Okay. But like if you try if
you do int first in the
you do int first in the
loop. Oh, cuz it's

wait. Oh, that's terrible. You can't
wait. Oh, that's terrible. You can't
possibly tell me this is good language
possibly tell me this is good language

I don't even want to use that because I
I don't even want to use that because I
didn't even know Python does that.
didn't even know Python does that.
That's freaking
That's freaking
terrible. What a [ __ ]

that Python is not always a bad language
that Python is not always a bad language
relies on you not doing that.
Don't do that. That's
horrifying. Can do is we can rewrite the
horrifying. Can do is we can rewrite the
entire thing in C including PyTorch.
Could it be the number of

of a difference just in the number of
of a difference just in the number of

I mean, there's no point in not just

But
like, yeah, this is not work. Like, this

Okay. Like this is the only other thing
Okay. Like this is the only other thing
I could
think, different number of maps.
think, different number of maps.
That'd be so weird though if like you
That'd be so weird though if like you
actually needed that many thousand maps
actually needed that many thousand maps
to
to
scale. All right. That'd be like
wonky. I mean, you did numb M is 4096
wonky. I mean, you did numb M is 4096
and then like config
and then like config
default was two, right? Two.
default was two, right? Two.
So, uh, this should end up with 8192
So, uh, this should end up with 8192
total
M's. And like, I'm not stupid, right? I
M's. And like, I'm not stupid, right? I
didn't have like a different number and
didn't have like a different number and
just not see
it. No, because this
it. No, because this
repros, right? So like this
repros and that repros with eight M's
repros and that repros with eight M's
41. So then it can't even be the numb
41. So then it can't even be the numb
maps cuz I reproed with
4096. So, this sweep that I just started
4096. So, this sweep that I just started
is
worthless. What the heck else would it
worthless. What the heck else would it
be?
Is it like some difference in
sweep? Hang on. Can I
like get compare
commits? Oh, I should just make a PR, I
commits? Oh, I should just make a PR, I
guess, right?
I don't need all these example
differences. I mean, there's some sweep

There really isn't a

Not that I can
see. Not this
see. Not this

Was it really not that? Cuz I'm like out

of things that it could be.
You return logs.
I thought that this like we had this

this was already in there.
pretty
sure.
And yes, this is this is literally
And yes, this is this is literally
already there.
You removed logger.log
log because now it just happens.
Tricky puzzle.
Let me just go check the um
default. Like there were changes in
here. Really just a clip co-op change.
I guess I like I could try
I guess I like I could try
this. Like it's technically possible
this. Like it's technically possible
this breaks it. I give it like a one in
this breaks it. I give it like a one in
20 at best.
This is the culprit.
I'd be very very surprised. Like I'd be
I'd be very very surprised. Like I'd be
so
surprised. I literally have these two
surprised. I literally have these two

And I know it's not in the

right? Yeah, the apps was deleted
right? Yeah, the apps was deleted
because it's not being used.
So literally nothing changes
There. And this is identical.
trying to think what I could have
trying to think what I could have
possibly
possibly
broken. It was very
broken. It was very
odd. Like all the things that I can
odd. Like all the things that I can
think of that I might have messed with,
think of that I might have messed with,
I already checked and I didn't mess with
I already checked and I didn't mess with
them.
I know it's a pure sweeps problem as
well. I mean, I think we got to go into
well. I mean, I think we got to go into
like
like
paranoid like paranoid mode
here. We go into super paranoid mode.
This could be it.
and I think it's literally just like
and I think it's literally just like
changing a mean
param. It'd be weird because like the
param. It'd be weird because like the
mean value was reasonable. I
mean value was reasonable. I
believe that'd be so
believe that'd be so
weird. I guess stranger things have

happened.
Let's look for other
Let's look for other
possibilities
meantime. Oh, you know
meantime. Oh, you know
what? Kill this
We'll go to
uh there we go. We'll be fully freaking
paranoid, you know. We'll be fully fully
paranoid. Okay. So, if that doesn't
paranoid. Okay. So, if that doesn't
match, then there's some some demons
match, then there's some some demons
inhabiting this code
inhabiting this code
base. I have to get out the holy water
base. I have to get out the holy water
and
and
the I don't know what else demons don't
the I don't know what else demons don't
like. Ion

cannons. We'll get some of those
out.
Those are all the thoughts I
Those are all the thoughts I
have. This does not work yet. I don't
have. This does not work yet. I don't
know. Sweep seems
identical. Oh, would have to be some
identical. Oh, would have to be some
like logging quirk
like logging quirk
change. Well, I guess technically, hang
change. Well, I guess technically, hang
on. if I screwed with the way that
on. if I screwed with the way that
logging
happens. But like there's no change to
grid.py. I guess technically it could be
grid.py. I guess technically it could be
a log change, but like I I don't think I
a log change, but like I I don't think I
did anything weird with that. I really
don't would make more sense as like a
don't would make more sense as like a
mean M's [ __ ]
thing. I still don't see how this would
thing. I still don't see how this would
change it though.
Like this would like this would almost
Like this would like this would almost
be just as weird if it were
this. I mean that's slightly different
this. I mean that's slightly different
but not statistically different I'd
but not statistically different I'd
imagine, right?
What did I change the means
What did I change the means
to? Didn't I change it to something that
to? Didn't I change it to something that
like shouldn't matter at
all? Like I changed the default
all? Like I changed the default
innies instead of having uh 8 M's what
innies instead of having uh 8 M's what
is it? No, eight M's mean two mean of
is it? No, eight M's mean two mean of
two M's that have 4096 each. I changed
two M's that have 4096 each. I changed
it to a mean of eight M's that have 1024
it to a mean of eight M's that have 1024
each. Like I guess
each. Like I guess
technically it's technically different.
technically it's technically different.
The mean point is the same though. And
The mean point is the same though. And
all the good runs are also in both of
these. That would be so weird, man.

So weird,
man. Is it actually
this? I mean, that's like meaningfully
this? I mean, that's like meaningfully
different
different
already. We're going to actually let
already. We're going to actually let
this run for a bit and then we're going
this run for a bit and then we're going
to back check
to back check
everything and back check everything.
If I just look at like numbum M's or
If I just look at like numbum M's or
whatever the hell
here it's all on two, right?
here it's all on two, right?
And then like if I go
here, eight and then
four. It could just be too many wasted
four. It could just be too many wasted
runs, you know? Well, like they're
runs, you know? Well, like they're
mostly clustered at eight.
mostly clustered at eight.
I don't know how that
I don't know how that
happens. Like the type of bug that would
happens. Like the type of bug that would
have to exist for this to be a thing is
have to exist for this to be a thing is
very
bizarre. That's like super weird, right?
especially because like I know that you
especially because like I know that you
can run the exact same params with the
can run the exact same params with the
other config and it
works. Like I would suspect like an
works. Like I would suspect like an
environment bug or something, but no.
If this is actually a fixed
It's something related to the way these
It's something related to the way these
distributions get sampled. I
guess like I got five runs on here
guess like I got five runs on here
versus over here.

Whoops. I go seven runs.
got four runs on it. It could just be
got four runs on it. It could just be
like a stickiness thing, you
know, like having the lower range is
know, like having the lower range is
just sticky to eight.
I mean, this is kind of what I get for
I mean, this is kind of what I get for
not having random seeds. I mean, like
not having random seeds. I mean, like
not having I should clarify that. So,
not having I should clarify that. So,
like normally you seed um hyper pram
like normally you seed um hyper pram
sweeps by doing like a few just uniform
sweeps by doing like a few just uniform
random samples, but the problem with
random samples, but the problem with
that is uniform random is sampling just
that is uniform random is sampling just
sucks for hyper pram sweeps. So, we just
sucks for hyper pram sweeps. So, we just
don't do it.
don't do it.
um it like can help with stuff like
um it like can help with stuff like
this, but even then technically that's
this, but even then technically that's
not even
guaranteed. Yeah, like we've got already
guaranteed. Yeah, like we've got already
we've got some decent runs. I mean, I
we've got some decent runs. I mean, I
could just be looking at noise still to
could just be looking at noise still to
be fair, but like
It went
It went
from Let me make sure I did this
correctly. This

way. Okay.
way. Okay.
So, Max got changed from 8 to 16 and
So, Max got changed from 8 to 16 and
then me went from two to eight and it
then me went from two to eight and it
broke.
That was the only other real change I
That was the only other real change I
made here, wasn't it?
that and returning the number of M's
that and returning the number of M's
like num ms to
4096 I mean I guess those are
4096 I mean I guess those are
substantially different ranges
right like on one of these you have one
right like on one of these you have one
vecend like one env
vecend like one env
is going to be 1024 agents and the other
is going to be 1024 agents and the other
one is going to be 4096 agents and then
one is going to be 4096 agents and then
the top end is going to be 32k versus
16k. So even though the means are the
16k. So even though the means are the
same, it does change the
same, it does change the
sampling process a bit because
sampling process a bit because
like okay if you have like let's say you
like okay if you have like let's say you
have your mean of two and then you
have your mean of two and then you
sample a one you still have 40 96
sample a one you still have 40 96
agents right and if you sample like a
agents right and if you sample like a
four then you have 16k agents whereas
four then you have 16k agents whereas
with
with
16 an eight mean like you could sample
16 an eight mean like you could sample
two and you only have 2k agents.
I guess also the
like when you have a mean of two, you're
like when you have a mean of two, you're
towards the bottom end of the
towards the bottom end of the
distribution. So like you're more likely
distribution. So like you're more likely
to sample upwards, I
guess, whereas in the other one here,
guess, whereas in the other one here,
you're likely to sample
you're likely to sample
downwards. I mean, this is such a subtle
downwards. I mean, this is such a subtle
change, though. Like, they should not be

breaking
things. And I mean, we don't even really

necessarily know that it does for sure
necessarily know that it does for sure
either. Like, for all I know, this could

broken. But like, if I go look
at like how much better is this sweep
at like how much better is this sweep

start to get

runs
runs
in, but there's RNG to
that. Okay. Okay. So, like getting a

4. I still think that this is good

[Music]
[Music]
because this
one like this point4
here. Yeah. Here I have 20 runs and I
here. Yeah. Here I have 20 runs and I
never get a
point4. And actually, I don't I have
point4. And actually, I don't I have
only one over two.
Yeah. So like pretty high confidence I
Yeah. So like pretty high confidence I
would say that this is materially

Bizarre. Oh, now I kind of have to run

You

go verify that real

Got like 20 second breakout somewhere
here. Yes. This is not the sub20.
Pro tip, if you advertise your UI based
Pro tip, if you advertise your UI based
on speed, actually make your UI
on speed, actually make your UI
fast. Like, okay, so there's some runs
fast. Like, okay, so there's some runs
in here, but
in here, but
like they don't actually full solve, I
like they don't actually full solve, I
don't
don't
think. They're like close, but no cigar.
Then we
Then we
have guy. Stop
have guy. Stop
that. Got these
that. Got these
[Music]
guys. Not it.
I think it was the 123 for some
reason. So, this is a 24 second
reason. So, this is a 24 second
here. Pretty sure it's
the Yeah, it's right here. So this
sweep was where we got the sub20. 20.
Okay. So, here are the
runs and let's see if we can
confirm my uh my suspicions
here. like this run right
here. Here's the commit stamp.
Huh. Interestingly, this is the same
commit as
commit as
before.
basically. So somehow this is how we got
basically. So somehow this is how we got
sub
20. This is the one.
Okay. So like uh
You know, this is actually not doing it
here. Did it just get lucky with the
point4? I have it like virtually
point4? I have it like virtually
identical here.
like a much stronger start as well.
There's still so much outfit in these
hypers. Got two different diffs
here. These are two different commits.
I didn't add like any other defaults or
I didn't add like any other defaults or
anything either. It is straight up just
anything either. It is straight up just
this this and then
this this and then
grid any
again. It repros. That's the weirdest
again. It repros. That's the weirdest
thing. It's not like I broke some other
thing. It's not like I broke some other
thing and now the run doesn't repro. It
thing and now the run doesn't repro. It
repros perfectly, but the sweep doesn't
repros perfectly, but the sweep doesn't
find
it. And it's not like broken sweeps
it. And it's not like broken sweeps
either. It actually will sweep and like
either. It actually will sweep and like
find decent enough runs, but they don't
find decent enough runs, but they don't
look the same, do they?
look the same, do they?
Maybe it is a log frequency [ __ ]
Maybe it is a log frequency [ __ ]
thing. Let me
see.
Like okay, here's maze
full. And then here is
for my
grid. These are how different these
grid. These are how different these
sweeps look,
right? They're pretty
chaotic. But so are
chaotic. But so are
these. I mean, we immediately we notice
these. I mean, we immediately we notice
the difference in
the difference in
length. 100 mil. Yeah. See, this has way
length. 100 mil. Yeah. See, this has way
more long
runs. Seven. And then this gets to one
runs. Seven. And then this gets to one
almost.
Like this still has some dumb
runs. I kind of want to
see. Apparently this is two separate
see. Apparently this is two separate
sweeps.
right? So this is the
cost and we have to like do this
shenanigans
shenanigans
173. Yeah. So, this like never ran
173. Yeah. So, this like never ran
anything expensive at
anything expensive at
all. Like at all at all. Never ran
all. Like at all at all. Never ran
anything
anything
expensive. And then this thing
here. Yeah, this ran some more expensive
stuff. Major difference.
Why does it look like time steps caps at
Why does it look like time steps caps at
mil? It doesn't.
Right. It says 6E8 right
Right. It says 6E8 right
there. It never uses it
though.
See, this one goes to 6
E8. Also got these two score
E8. Also got these two score
curves. again if I like fix
this. I
mean, well, it's very
mean, well, it's very
different. This is getting 0.9 like
different. This is getting 0.9 like
really soon even,
really soon even,
right? It's like in the first hour and a
right? It's like in the first hour and a
half of sweeps.
This is 12:00 p.m. to 10:00
a.m. Wait,
a.m. Wait,
12. Yeah. So, they both take 10
hours. Kind of weird with how some of
hours. Kind of weird with how some of
those runs are like way shorter.
mess something
up. Yeah. See, this doesn't work still.
Hang on. Is this quite
different? How many of these are we
running? Eight.
Wait, we start at 8 and then from to
810 or rather let's go to 8:20. We do 1
810 or rather let's go to 8:20. We do 1
2 3 4 5
2 3 4 5
6 7 12 16
6 7 12 16
runs by 8:20 p.m. That actually looks
reasonable runs by 8:20 p.m. So we go 20
reasonable runs by 8:20 p.m. So we go 20
minutes ahead is going to be like
here 16. Yeah, now these are
here 16. Yeah, now these are
reasonable. There's not like some jank
reasonable. There's not like some jank
timing difference.
you'd kind of expect there to be, but
you'd kind of expect there to be, but
there isn't
So weird if it was logging stuff because

like the curves are fine, right?
Yeah, like you reproduce the smooth

This down sample is the same. We didn't
This down sample is the same. We didn't
change it.
It's just 5 versus 10 which we already
checked many. Oh, that's
nothing. It can't be an error with the
nothing. It can't be an error with the

end
because because they're run
repros, but I don't see a difference
repros, but I don't see a difference
with the
with the
hypers search.
I already matched the spaces
exactly. Could it literally be
RNG? I don't think so.
Right. I mean, like technically though,
Right. I mean, like technically though,
right? Could it be?
N man, this is like it's too big of a
N man, this is like it's too big of a
difference to just be RNG.
Okay. Have time steps.
It's running stuff for
longer. Probably because of
longer. Probably because of
this. Like it is running stuff for a
this. Like it is running stuff for a
little
longer. It should be doing that.
I'm trying to think what's the
I'm trying to think what's the
likelihood that I have a screw up versus
likelihood that I have a screw up versus
what is the likelihood that it's just
what is the likelihood that it's just
very fiddly.
Okay. I
Okay. I
bet the GPUs are should be here
bet the GPUs are should be here
tomorrow. Got slightly

delayed. The problem
delayed. The problem
is the sweep the sweep results. They're
is the sweep the sweep results. They're
still working, but they're not matching
still working, but they're not matching
the previous sweep results. So, I'm
the previous sweep results. So, I'm
trying to see if I changed anything in
trying to see if I changed anything in
sweep defaults. And I changed a few very
sweep defaults. And I changed a few very
minor things, but I like it doesn't seem
minor things, but I like it doesn't seem
to make a huge
to make a huge
difference. But I'm trying to figure out
difference. But I'm trying to figure out
what are the odds that like the sweeps
what are the odds that like the sweeps
are just kind of fiddly and like, you
are just kind of fiddly and like, you
know, maybe sometimes it takes 200 runs,
know, maybe sometimes it takes 200 runs,
sometimes it takes 400
sometimes it takes 400
runs versus
runs versus
um like did I actually break something?
The thing is that before now there has
The thing is that before now there has
to be a difference because
like this is like dramatically
better that like this thing doesn't work
better that like this thing doesn't work
now. this thing
now. this thing

here. This has got to be like 50 runs
that it takes to get this

dramatically
different. And mind you,
like it is solving before it gets to
like it is solving before it gets to
some ridiculous number of steps. First
some ridiculous number of steps. First

and second. So this is the good one.
And this is the bad
one. So the y ais on this one goes to
7. Give
7. Give
score four score.
I mean the point is this one this is a
I mean the point is this one this is a
178 run sweep. Look you can see that
178 run sweep. Look you can see that
within 50 or so experiments it's like
within 50 or so experiments it's like
0.98
0.98
whatever. And this one here it gets up

So I like here's the thing that I
So I like here's the thing that I
literally I can run the optimal hypers
literally I can run the optimal hypers
from the old sweep and the the curve
reproduces. So those hypers are
good. The hyper pram are not broken.
Thanks,
Plasma. How would the curve produced,

We didn't mess with hypers up here,
right? This is just added here from hard

But it can't look

Oh, you know what this was? Okay, I

This is before I fixed the

No, it's fine. All right, that's it.
I mean, I could go try to fix this egg

you close

the means towards like stuff
that's closer to the defaults.
and I just hope that fixes
it. Maybe I should look at the means.

Maybe that's better.
Like the means get used for first

according to

There could have been slight

here was use final est. It's just this

small little fix.
small little fix.
And we're already doing this
on Oh, well, this is not actually
on Oh, well, this is not actually
working either, now is
it? Neither of these are working.
Now I'm starting to wonder because the
Now I'm starting to wonder because the
sweep result doesn't
repro. The runner repros but not the
repro. The runner repros but not the
sweep
result. If I had to choose one of the
result. If I had to choose one of the
two to repro, at least I got the better
two to repro, at least I got the better
of the
two. I remember this fix as well.
And like it's very weird because we can
And like it's very weird because we can
clearly
see this is the 178
see this is the 178

time steps and min. They were set
correctly.
Whoops. Like that's not the issue there.
Okay, I have something I want to
try. Got something I want to try.
this.
Let's see which defaults I don't
like.
999. Pretty darn

Fine.

couple last bugs and experiments and

things. It's a lot of work.
We get there though. We get

And they're like small changes maybe.
exercise on

Are these the ship params? Hang

Ah, okay. Hang
Ah, okay. Hang

very low learning

is small.
Oh, no. It's a bigger policy. That's why
Oh, no. It's a bigger policy. That's why
the learning rate's smaller. Duh.
We

Neptune. Come

Our service page, it says it's perfectly
Our service page, it says it's perfectly

My guy.
Give me my

Well, that just about figures
it. I forgot I only have it on this

straight up stopped logging as well
straight up stopped logging as well
because there's no more runs in there.
because there's no more runs in there.
That's kind of
shitty. Oh yeah, look at that.
I mean, this is kind of an interesting
I mean, this is kind of an interesting
question, right, of like what I
question, right, of like what I
do when
um when I'm confronted with something
um when I'm confronted with something
like this where I've checked
like this where I've checked
everything very very precisely.
I know numm's changed, man. I've tried
I know numm's changed, man. I've tried
it both ways. And in this change, we
it both ways. And in this change, we
also changed um first of all, this one's
also changed um first of all, this one's
the breakout uh commit. And when we did
the breakout uh commit. And when we did
this, we also changed env.
this, we also changed env.
So we multiplied vecum ms by four and
So we multiplied vecum ms by four and
divided num ms by four. And I also I
divided num ms by four. And I also I
tried it both ways as
well. I mean I'm leaning towards just
well. I mean I'm leaning towards just
like
Default beep config
jank or like I'm thinking what we
do take
do take
status not just random Bad.
Not necessarily that either.
Okay. So, I think what I'm leaning to
Okay. So, I think what I'm leaning to
do, we're going to just try some yolo
do, we're going to just try some yolo
[ __ ] 9:25. I'm getting
[ __ ] 9:25. I'm getting
tired. I'm going to try some yolo [ __ ]
Yes.
It's been auto though.
There is actually a correlation. That's
funny. Leave these in.
Very pretty wildly. Okay.
That's going to kill my neural MMO run,
That's going to kill my neural MMO run,
isn't
isn't
it? Neptune.
Interesting.
Yeah, this this
bug. Hey, it's Ben,
bug. Hey, it's Ben,
sir. Trying to track down some like
sir. Trying to track down some like
inconsistent with sweeps. How's it
inconsistent with sweeps. How's it
going? and chat briefly about Terraform
going? and chat briefly about Terraform
if you
want. I'm just trying to figure out what
want. I'm just trying to figure out what
the hell's wrong with this
stuff. Hey,
Spencer. For some
Spencer. For some
reason, the sweeps are not doing uh like
reason, the sweeps are not doing uh like
they're still working, but they're not
they're still working, but they're not
doing anywhere near as well as they were
doing anywhere near as well as they were
before. And I can't figure out why
before. And I can't figure out why
because the code's like
identical. So, I've been trying to sort
identical. So, I've been trying to sort
that out.
Maximum terraforming
precision. Mhm.
Yep.
I got like initial distributed training
I got like initial distributed training
running. Um I have to obviously like do
running. Um I have to obviously like do
some tests. So, I'm like I'm getting a
some tests. So, I'm like I'm getting a
default just a run of neural MMO without

sweeps running actually
sweeps running actually
technically. I mean, we should be able
technically. I mean, we should be able
to do
like this thing should be like 200
like this thing should be like 200
billion a day or something crazy like
billion a day or something crazy like
that. Maybe like 150 on the
4090s. So we should be able to really
4090s. So we should be able to really
crank some
experiments. What advantages are we? It

just it trains like virtually like a

multiple of the number of GPUs that you
have faster.
What specifically?
the cap that wasn't there with your
the cap that wasn't there with your

You know, it's actually one thing that
You know, it's actually one thing that
we probably should fix. Actually, here I
we probably should fix. Actually, here I
You know what? I here This is totally
You know what? I here This is totally

it, man.
Um yeah, I I don't know how I screwed
Um yeah, I I don't know how I screwed
this up, come to think of it. Uh, for
this up, come to think of it. Uh, for
the pearl and
the pearl and

might have to play with the range of the

There's like offset
There's like offset

that. Oh, did you already tell me that
that. Oh, did you already tell me that
you did that?
Okay, my bad. Yeah.
Okay, my bad. Yeah.
So, okay. It's totally training on all

the same maps. So, that's probably
why cuz
it's Yeah. Okay. That's major. That's
it's Yeah. Okay. That's major. That's

Gabe, we are on stream for reference.
Gabe, we are on stream for reference.
Yeah, we're good. Uh I
Yeah, we're good. Uh I
am trying to figure out what the hell
am trying to figure out what the hell
with
with
sweeps. It's just a bit jank, you
sweeps. It's just a bit jank, you
know. Oh, this is so funny. Like
know. Oh, this is so funny. Like
MMO and then this tiny little
experiment. I
experiment. I
mean like technically that's a little
mean like technically that's a little
better than before.
uh just like how quickly like it within
uh just like how quickly like it within
nine experiments it's found a few runs
nine experiments it's found a few runs
that this
um basically I like the sweeps are
um basically I like the sweeps are
working worse than before and I can't
working worse than before and I can't
tell if like there looks like there's no
tell if like there looks like there's no
code difference so I can't tell if it's
code difference so I can't tell if it's
just fiddly because of the default
just fiddly because of the default
sampling ranges or if I actually broke
sampling ranges or if I actually broke
something but I like meticulously went
something but I like meticulously went
through every line of the diff and I
through every line of the diff and I
can't find anything. Apparently, people
can't find anything. Apparently, people
can't hear. Hang

What's up? Yeah, there we go. You guys,

you can't blame me when it just switches

It's just dumb.

Yeah, I don't even think it's Linux
Yeah, I don't even think it's Linux

just like having shitty ways that they
just like having shitty ways that they
pick up defaults.
Do you think there's any
Do you think there's any
benefit to telling an agent where the
benefit to telling an agent where the
other dozers are at? Might be.
Because the only weird situation I could
Because the only weird situation I could
see happening is
see happening is
like all of each all the agents go to
like all of each all the agents go to
the same area and try and extract dirt
the same area and try and extract dirt
from the same point.
Uh yeah, that could totally happen.
I'll run that experiment after this
sweep. I kind of just want to find like
sweep. I kind of just want to find like
a param that works like relatively well
a param that works like relatively well
so I don't have to just keep on sweeping
so I don't have to just keep on sweeping
every time I make a new change.
Um, well, it kind of depends how much
Um, well, it kind of depends how much
you change the end.
Well, yeah. I mean, if I change ops, I
Well, yeah. I mean, if I change ops, I
mean, I'm pretty sure I have to sweep
again. I'm also just a little bit
again. I'm also just a little bit
suspicious of like some of the sweeps
suspicious of like some of the sweeps
lately.
lately.
Um, if we get this working and then I go
Um, if we get this working and then I go
and I run breakout and pong and those
and I run breakout and pong and those
still work then
still work then
like I think decent
maybe having a
few.3s. I do know that sometimes I've
few.3s. I do know that sometimes I've
been able to manually screw with params
been able to manually screw with params
a little bit to get more optimal stuff
a little bit to get more optimal stuff
on GPU drive before
on GPU drive before
which you shouldn't be able to do. So
which you shouldn't be able to do. So
it's
it's
like I just like tweak the reward a
like I just like tweak the reward a
little bit. The crazy thing here is that
little bit. The crazy thing here is that
the hyper prams repro perfectly. This
the hyper prams repro perfectly. This
it's the sweep that doesn't. So I have
it's the sweep that doesn't. So I have
this like god set of grid parameters
this like god set of grid parameters

Yeah. Yeah. I I've experienced something
Yeah. Yeah. I I've experienced something
similar GPU drive. Like I I would get
similar GPU drive. Like I I would get
like a really good set of stuff and then
like a really good set of stuff and then
if I try to run a different sweep after
if I try to run a different sweep after
like the most minor of tweaks, it would
like the most minor of tweaks, it would
like really struggle to find that same
like really struggle to find that same
one it found in a previous

Uh yeah. Um, I did make some progress
Uh yeah. Um, I did make some progress
though, but
though, but
uh I think there's still improvement to
uh I think there's still improvement to
be made. Um, I kind of got to like
be made. Um, I kind of got to like
a I got one model learning better than
a I got one model learning better than
it was, but I also added just like a ton
it was, but I also added just like a ton
of prams to the model size. And I feel
of prams to the model size. And I feel
like you shouldn't have to train seven
like you shouldn't have to train seven
billion steps on Pac-Man or whatever.

Yeah. Yeah. I saw that seven billion
Yeah. Yeah. I saw that seven billion

it it it uh it looks pretty good. Have
it it it uh it looks pretty good. Have
you run a sweep?
you run a sweep?
I I have not run a sweep. Okay. Cuz I
I I have not run a sweep. Okay. Cuz I
swept cuz I got I showed you the model I
swept cuz I got I showed you the model I
got from Pac-Man. And this was the old
got from Pac-Man. And this was the old

to make it like actually doable. I did
to make it like actually doable. I did
change the mechanics. So, like on the
change the mechanics. So, like on the
old version of
old version of
Pac-Man, I got 200 experiments for
Pac-Man, I got 200 experiments for

repro. So, this like actual PF was like
repro. So, this like actual PF was like
I think this is like 160 170ish
range before you made it easy. But like
range before you made it easy. But like
you can see the disparity here in all
you can see the disparity here in all
these runs.
these runs.
Yeah, that's a pretty wide range. So,
Yeah, that's a pretty wide range. So,
like the point here is if you're just
like the point here is if you're just
like using some defaults,
like using some defaults,
right, you should just run sweep.
right, you should just run sweep.
Yeah. No, I I think I think I could you
Yeah. No, I I think I think I could you
could definitely do a lot better than

that it could be that our there could be

nuts. There just so many like shitty
nuts. There just so many like shitty
experiments and things to check.
Yeah, I'm hoping that after the latest
Yeah, I'm hoping that after the latest
sweep, I should have like pretty god
sweep, I should have like pretty god
tier GPU drive params on a fixed set of
tier GPU drive params on a fixed set of
maps. And then I still got to somehow
maps. And then I still got to somehow
figure out why resampling is like not
figure out why resampling is like not
working,
working,
but I know it shouldn't be like an issue
but I know it shouldn't be like an issue
on a fixed set. Fix set is going to be
on a fixed set. Fix set is going to be
like for sure 100%
solved because I got one set of maps
solved because I got one set of maps
that got to like 999 and like 0.002 or
that got to like 999 and like 0.002 or
something like that. Like it was like
something like that. Like it was like
good enough.
I really like this
end. It's just so cool to
watch. I uh I really like your your
watch. I uh I really like your your
snake, too. The multi-agent snake. Snake
snake, too. The multi-agent snake. Snake
is really cool. Yeah, it's uh it's a lot
is really cool. Yeah, it's uh it's a lot
of fun to watch that one.
I was thinking about doing a continuous
I was thinking about doing a continuous
version of it as well. It would just be
version of it as well. It would just be
like substantially harder to make that
like substantially harder to make that
fast, I believe.
What do you mean by continuous here?
What do you mean by continuous here?
Like continuous positions like the
Like continuous positions like the
positions here are
Gotcha. Like oh man, like the merging
Gotcha. Like oh man, like the merging
behavior on these is so cool. like how
behavior on these is so cool. like how
they like split and
merge. So
merge. So
cool. And just like the fact that they
cool. And just like the fact that they
have a turning
have a turning
radius, you get like all these like
radius, you get like all these like
knots and
knots and
stuff and like occasionally half the
stuff and like occasionally half the
half of the one color of puffers end up
half of the one color of puffers end up
in one spot and half end up in another
in one spot and half end up in another
and then they end up merging.
Almost makes me think of well like a
Almost makes me think of well like a
school of fish, you know. Well, it is a
school of fish, you know. Well, it is a
school of fish. Yeah.
Um, do you have predators in that? Like
Um, do you have predators in that? Like
I see it's school of fish, but like you
I see it's school of fish, but like you
should put predators in there.
should put predators in there.
Some swarming. It's just fish that are
Some swarming. It's just fish that are
attempting to go to the the uh star that
attempting to go to the the uh star that
matches their color and then they change
matches their color and then they change
color when they get it.
Okay. I was going to say put like a
Okay. I was going to say put like a
dolphin in there and they have to avoid
dolphin in there and they have to avoid
dolphins too.
It's like crazy like they end up
like Captain's suggestion to have the
like Captain's suggestion to have the
goals move around was a really good
one cuz it like produces just these
one cuz it like produces just these
really different patterns.
I got to get the puffer model like the
I got to get the puffer model like the
3D file. We could do this in 3D.
Nice. That would be awesome.
probably not much harder in 3D.
probably not much harder in 3D.
Make it an actual puffer tank. Yeah,
you gave this one continuous uh
you gave this one continuous uh
positions, right? Yep.
Discrete actions for continuous
Discrete actions for continuous
positions.
positions.
Right. Right. Right.
Right. Right. Right.
And then
uh what was your vision like on this?
uh what was your vision like on this?
It's really easy. It's like really
It's really easy. It's like really
basic. You just do you just do relative
basic. You just do you just do relative
position of star? They just see the
position of star? They just see the
relative position of each like the
relative position of each like the
closest of each color of star.
closest of each color of star.
The closest of each color. Okay.
So basically all they have to learn
So basically all they have to learn
right they have to learn to match like
right they have to learn to match like
to map their color to star and then the
to map their color to star and then the
non-trivial part is that they have to
non-trivial part is that they have to
drag that like like simple onestep
drag that like like simple onestep
inference over the much longer pathing
horizon that make
horizon that make
sense like I don't understand so like
sense like I don't understand so like
actually pathing to the goal is like a
actually pathing to the goal is like a
manystep process right Sure.
manystep process right Sure.
The making the decision like the
The making the decision like the
decision of like I am X color so I
decision of like I am X color so I
choose X goal is a one-step decision.
choose X goal is a one-step decision.
So, it's like a kind of an interesting
So, it's like a kind of an interesting
thing where they have to like learn this
thing where they have to like learn this
decision and then they have to follow
decision and then they have to follow
through on it with all the pathing
through on it with all the pathing
[Music]
and then the fact that this just like
and then the fact that this just like
learns instantly with default hypers in
learns instantly with default hypers in
seconds. And just naturally with the
seconds. And just naturally with the
turning radius and the variation, you
turning radius and the variation, you
get like
get like
these and
these and
Like you you even get like a little bit
Like you you even get like a little bit
of separation even though there's no
of separation even though there's no
reward for
separation. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I wonder
separation. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I wonder
what it would be like if you decided to
what it would be like if you decided to
add
a I don't know, like a
a I don't know, like a
nearest if you're too close to a fish
nearest if you're too close to a fish
penalty, too.
penalty, too.
Yeah. I mean, then I would actually have
Yeah. I mean, then I would actually have
to do some engineering to make it fast
to do some engineering to make it fast
because then it gets like N squared with
because then it gets like N squared with
a ton of fish.
a ton of fish.
That's an Nbody problem. Yep.
That's something else. Well, can't you
That's something else. Well, can't you
make it fairly fixed and just check like
make it fairly fixed and just check like
five around you or something like that?
five around you or something like that?
Uh, you have to make it so that you can
Uh, you have to make it so that you can
only have a fixed number occupying each
only have a fixed number occupying each
cell or something, but then Yeah. Yeah.
cell or something, but then Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Do that. Yeah. Yeah. Because
Yeah. Yeah. Do that. Yeah. Yeah. Because
that's what I do on uh I do fixed
that's what I do on uh I do fixed
occupied
arrays for GPU drive stuff. Yeah. This
arrays for GPU drive stuff. Yeah. This
is a lot denser though with the number
is a lot denser though with the number
of agents.
of agents.
Sure. Sure. I mean, you have like a
Sure. Sure. I mean, you have like a
thousand agents.
thousand agents.
Yeah. And this is one of those things
Yeah. And this is one of those things
where like it just looks cooler the more
where like it just looks cooler the more
agents you have. So like if I were to
agents you have. So like if I were to
have like a zoomed out version of this
have like a zoomed out version of this
in 3D, it might want to be like 8,000
agents. I wonder if
agents. I wonder if
the policy
the policy
entropy controls the spread or if it's
entropy controls the spread or if it's
related to spread.
related to spread.
like just like a little bit a little bit
like just like a little bit a little bit
of variability and and how the policy
of variability and and how the policy
well they kind of move like fish as well
well they kind of move like fish as well
because like the control is like they
because like the control is like they
can only turn in certain
can only turn in certain
increments. So they actually if you like
increments. So they actually if you like
look at them they kind of like wobble
look at them they kind of like wobble
around a little like fish
do. That makes
sense. Came out very nicely.
sense. Came out very nicely.
What would be really satisfying is like
What would be really satisfying is like
if you're able to make this interactive
if you're able to make this interactive
somehow through the human side. Yeah.
somehow through the human side. Yeah.
Yeah. I'm going to do that at some
Yeah. I'm going to do that at some
point. I'll make it so like can like
point. I'll make it so like can like
click and drag all the fish to you or
click and drag all the fish to you or
something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
That's exactly what I was going for.
That's exactly what I was going for.
Yeah. Or like you can like right click
Yeah. Or like you can like right click
and like the fish will swim away from
and like the fish will swim away from
you.
I don't know. Maybe we just maybe there
I don't know. Maybe we just maybe there
is like a game in this, you know? Maybe
is like a game in this, you know? Maybe
we could actually ship a Steam game
we could actually ship a Steam game
that's just like the world's best fish
that's just like the world's best fish
tank simulator.
tank simulator.
Fish tank. You just you just feed the
Fish tank. You just you just feed the
fish and they like it's like just like a
fish and they like it's like just like a
school of fish, right?
I feel like there's a steam game
I feel like there's a steam game
somewhere in in in a end. I think
somewhere in in in a end. I think
there's there's opportunity there. It's
there's there's opportunity there. It's
just a matter of which which end it was
just a matter of which which end it was
most interesting.
most interesting.
I think one thing about RL for games,
I think one thing about RL for games,
which like maybe there's a solution to,
which like maybe there's a solution to,
but like if if your goal is to train an
but like if if your goal is to train an
opponent to a human player using
opponent to a human player using
RL, how do you keep it at the right
RL, how do you keep it at the right
level of
level of
difficulty? Because you don't want it to
difficulty? Because you don't want it to
be too good because that's not fun. You
be too good because that's not fun. You
don't want the human just to get stomped
don't want the human just to get stomped
every time. Like it's got a I mean to be
every time. Like it's got a I mean to be
honest like there's so much dumb [ __ ]
honest like there's so much dumb [ __ ]
you could do with that. Like you could
you could do with that. Like you could
literally just like go back five
literally just like go back five
checkpoints every time they uh they lose
checkpoints every time they uh they lose
and go forward Yeah. and just go forward
and go forward Yeah. and just go forward
five checkpoints every time they win.
That makes sense. There's so much dumb
That makes sense. There's so much dumb
stuff you could do for that.
stuff you could do for that.
What's funny is that's like a much
What's funny is that's like a much
simpler solution as opposed to doing
simpler solution as opposed to doing
some type of like it's so much simpler
some type of like it's so much simpler
online selfplay or some [ __ ] Yeah,
like just just train a good model and
like just just train a good model and
give it a bad checkpoint.
I mean that's I guess chess AI sort of
I mean that's I guess chess AI sort of
has the same problem of like these are
has the same problem of like these are
like heavily nerfed algorithms.
Chess is hard.
Chess is hard.
Yeah. And chess AI is so good at this
Yeah. And chess AI is so good at this

match the best chess AI. Definitely not.

No, that's already been proven. I mean,
No, that's already been proven. I mean,
I'm pretty sure Magnus like regularly
I'm pretty sure Magnus like regularly

Even Magnus Carlson acknowledges

sim on uh YouTube earlier

today and it really convinced me like
today and it really convinced me like
they weren't even doing anything
they weren't even doing anything
sophisticated. It's like it's actually
sophisticated. It's like it's actually
really convinced me that this form stuff
really convinced me that this form stuff
is just easy and like basically all the
is just easy and like basically all the
multi- aent stuff I was trying to do um
multi- aent stuff I was trying to do um
seven years ago it was actually totally
seven years ago it was actually totally
reasonable and just didn't work because
reasonable and just didn't work because
our infrastructure sucked.
That might make sense.
That might make sense.
That actually might be a good thing to
That actually might be a good thing to
think about as well, Spencer. Like like
think about as well, Spencer. Like like
specifically multi-agent problems
specifically multi-agent problems
because those are going to be the ones
because those are going to be the ones
where people have failed the hardest
where people have failed the hardest
before.
That's going to be your your instead of
That's going to be your your instead of
just putting the dirt down, you're going
just putting the dirt down, you're going
to have dump trucks that come and take
to have dump trucks that come and take
it away.
I mean, that would just straight up
I mean, that would just straight up
work.
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I I got to think
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I I got to think
about like what what subsets of
about like what what subsets of
industries benefit most from multi- aent
industries benefit most from multi- aent
type problems.
Well, the thing is you have to get a
Well, the thing is you have to get a
little flexible with what an agent
little flexible with what an agent
is. I think
is. I think
uh details
uh details
well like technically these puffers
well like technically these puffers
like if you consider each star is like a
like if you consider each star is like a
resource, right? Then the puffers are
resource, right? Then the puffers are
like and the puffers are like just
like and the puffers are like just
routing resource like one to another.
routing resource like one to another.
These could be like delivery bots. I
These could be like delivery bots. I
mean they can approximate freaking
mean they can approximate freaking
conveyor belts like Yeah. Yeah. I see
conveyor belts like Yeah. Yeah. I see
what you're saying.
That's the factorial of right. I mean,
That's the factorial of right. I mean,
I've been playing Satisfactory. Yo,
I've been playing Satisfactory. Yo,
Spencer, the uh the non-automated
Spencer, the uh the non-automated
factory idea turned out to just be
factory idea turned out to just be
incredibly stupid. At least the way I
incredibly stupid. At least the way I
did it was incredibly stupid. So,
did it was incredibly stupid. So,
lo and behold,
lo and behold,
I won't share that concept with them.
I won't share that concept with them.
Yeah,
Yeah,
what was that concept? The concept was I
what was that concept? The concept was I
just made I made like a bunch of modules
just made I made like a bunch of modules
where it's like the same module and all
where it's like the same module and all
it does is it has a bunch of containers
it does is it has a bunch of containers
where you put in inputs and a bunch of
where you put in inputs and a bunch of
containers where the outputs go and like
containers where the outputs go and like
but the thing is it doesn't actually
but the thing is it doesn't actually
like route to any other module. So the
like route to any other module. So the
idea was just that like you have each
idea was just that like you have each
thing build a ton of one thing and then
thing build a ton of one thing and then
every so often you just manually move
every so often you just manually move
the outputs to the inputs of the
the outputs to the inputs of the
whatever the next thing is and then like
whatever the next thing is and then like
you can just reuse modules for like
you can just reuse modules for like
making whatever one thing that you want.
making whatever one thing that you want.
Um yeah, that idea sucked for a few
Um yeah, that idea sucked for a few
reasons. One of which is a bug in in the
reasons. One of which is a bug in in the
game which causes the conveyor belt to
game which causes the conveyor belt to
jam uh when you do that. So that one's
jam uh when you do that. So that one's
not on me. Yeah, there's a bug that
not on me. Yeah, there's a bug that
caused the conveyor belts to jam. And uh
caused the conveyor belts to jam. And uh
the other thing was just that like you
the other thing was just that like you
need a lot of input materials to get
need a lot of input materials to get
this whole thing started. So for a long
this whole thing started. So for a long
time you're just like manually moving
time you're just like manually moving
like a few stacks and you're just kind
like a few stacks and you're just kind
of like running around for a long time
of like running around for a long time
to get the thing started. Um, and it's
to get the thing started. Um, and it's
also like really easy to like the
also like really easy to like the
modules are big, so it's actually pretty
modules are big, so it's actually pretty
difficult to keep track of like what
difficult to keep track of like what
each of your 16 modules or whatever is
each of your 16 modules or whatever is
doing at any one time.
Uh, you say you're just making a factory
Uh, you say you're just making a factory
that is not automated. Yeah, that was
that is not automated. Yeah, that was
the idea. What? Interesting. Well, the
the idea. What? Interesting. Well, the
thing is because otherwise you have to
thing is because otherwise you have to
like get all these dumb ratios right
like get all these dumb ratios right
from like one machine to the next
from like one machine to the next
machine or and like the thing that was
machine or and like the thing that was
cool is I basically I've had to like it
cool is I basically I've had to like it
it I got around that because they didn't
it I got around that because they didn't
all get routed like directly together.
all get routed like directly together.
You actually didn't have to really worry
You actually didn't have to really worry
about the ratios much at all.
Uh interesting.
Uh interesting.

very very intentionally. The best part
very very intentionally. The best part
about Linux is that it doesn't run
about Linux is that it doesn't run
League or Valerant, so I can't become

they're just, you know, pretty pretty
they're just, you know, pretty pretty
torn between having to micromanage the

just like numbum threads equals num m
basically like couldn't that just
work? No
work? No

not really emulating a CP. You're
not really emulating a CP. You're
emulating a ridiculously slow CPU,
emulating a ridiculously slow CPU,
right? But then like you have a bunch of

introducing like more latency not only
introducing like more latency not only
sending and receiving data but also like

graphs for the puffer box status so you

could see like the time scale over seven

I'm iterating over

It's probably some weird like

It's also worth questioning, is the

First of
all, this actually works perfectly
all, this actually works perfectly
fine. Nothing wrong with uh our sweeps

at all. Takes, you know, three billion

steps or whatever to get off the ground,

but it's it's fine.
but it's it's fine.
Now there is something wrong with our
Now there is something wrong with our
sweep our sweeping function
sweep our sweeping function

out I just want to figure out why it is

that the sweep did not find these
that the sweep did not find these

fine. So, I mean, all of these things
like look
like look
reasonable, but then it still doesn't
reasonable, but then it still doesn't
find
find
uh these params in a big
sweep. Let me try very quickly. I just
sweep. Let me try very quickly. I just
want to see how much worse it
want to see how much worse it
gets. 16
Reason I want to rerun this is because
Reason I want to rerun this is because
it is possible that there's some quirk
it is possible that there's some quirk
where it's just very difficult for it to
where it's just very difficult for it to
sweep over
sweep over
um this type of
um this type of
parameter like this log space
parameter like this log space
parameter due to how the sampling math
parameter due to how the sampling math
works.
works.
So, it could be that it just can't find
So, it could be that it just can't find
the small mini
the small mini
batches. We shall see.
Oh yeah, so far that is not really
Oh yeah, so far that is not really
learning.
See? Meanwhile
See? Meanwhile
though, our 200 run
though, our 200 run
example one the one that didn't work
example one the one that didn't work
super
well. I mean this actually does find
well. I mean this actually does find
like a few
like a few
runs at 8192.
It's most likely eval or something
It's most likely eval or something
weird, right?
what? Oh, no. This is a different one,
what? Oh, no. This is a different one,
right? Yeah, this is
different. This one
No, not this
one. This one.
I suspect that this is going to come
I suspect that this is going to come
down to differences
down to differences
uh minor differences made with this
uh minor differences made with this
sweep setup.
So this
So this
does not
reset that we do not reset and then we
reset that we do not reset and then we
do 32
do 32
updates. How this one
updates. How this one
goes. Uh now notably actually this is
goes. Uh now notably actually this is
doing pretty darn
doing pretty darn
well. So,
like that's I didn't expect that. Hang
on. Okay. Like it's not it's not
on. Okay. Like it's not it's not
anywhere near as good as
anywhere near as good as
this. But like this is still better than
this. But like this is still better than
we what we found in the other sweep. So
we what we found in the other sweep. So
it's not just mini batch size. It's not
it's not just mini batch size. It's not
just mini batch size as a parameter.
It's causing problems. I don't know why
It's causing problems. I don't know why
I have these on.
So, we don't reset and then we do 32
So, we don't reset and then we do 32
updates of
eval. Uh, that's like totally
fine. I down sample
Is there like a little spike at the end
Is there like a little spike at the end
or something
or something
weird that like messes with
it? See
anything? Sort of compare the uh the
anything? Sort of compare the uh the
terminals
terminals
behavior. One of the things that matters
behavior. One of the things that matters
is how the sweep finishes.
is how the sweep finishes.
So like uh this is the bad
So like uh this is the bad
one. Can we get this like small uptick
one. Can we get this like small uptick
maybe at the
maybe at the
end? Yeah, it looks like there's Well,
end? Yeah, it looks like there's Well,
it's not always an
it's not always an
uptick. Okay, but then like with this
uptick. Okay, but then like with this
one these things have the same
one these things have the same
thing. Kind of have the same like
thing. Kind of have the same like
tick a little bit more
tick a little bit more
flat. Oh, there's still like a change.
They're both like
They're both like
solid real time
closer. So I mean what causes that,
right?
suggestions per bare random
samples. They're all the same as they
were. Search center
on. Yeah, I have this
already. Okay. So, like
There very very few things then that
There very very few things then that
this could
this could
be could actually be different
be could actually be different
here. Not a lot
changed. I'm going to try it with
The

the the sampling at the

end wrong

first. Like isn't there this down sample
alt? Okay, so
alt? Okay, so
like Oh no, this has the last
Yeah. So, this actually
Yeah. So, this actually
has last. The only thing that this could
has last. The only thing that this could
be is the 10 samples. 10 samples versus
be is the 10 samples. 10 samples versus
five,
right? Can't think of anything
right? Can't think of anything
else. Let's SSH in and try
it. Didn't I do that in this sweep,
it. Didn't I do that in this sweep,
though? I thought that I tried that.
Make sure I didn't already do that. 200
Make sure I didn't already do that. 200
runs. Do like
this. Okay, we
this. Okay, we
change. Oh, we capped it at
change. Oh, we capped it at
288. That was probably pretty
stupid.
Could it literally just be the time
Could it literally just be the time
steps? Like if we capped a
steps? Like if we capped a
2E8 like it just did too many short
runs. I mean that's kind of jank if so,
runs. I mean that's kind of jank if so,
but
when I did grid
here. 5 E7 to
here. 5 E7 to
6E8. I mean, that's naturally going to
6E8. I mean, that's naturally going to
make it more aggressive at the start,
make it more aggressive at the start,
maybe.
We're going to try both of those
We're going to try both of those
changes. We'll see if that uh that
changes. We'll see if that uh that
recovers it or
not. The dispenser's container. My bad.
Okay. So, this is the
Okay. So, this is the
grid. This is 3.0 pre4. So, which is
grid. This is 3.0 pre4. So, which is
going to be the the one that we're
on. Ocean.

We don't care about
that. So, like, has this actually just
that. So, like, has this actually just
been fine?
5768. Well, then the only thing that
5768. Well, then the only thing that
this could possibly be
is this going from 10 to five,
is this going from 10 to five,
right? Maybe it needs 10 samples. I
right? Maybe it needs 10 samples. I
don't freaking know.
We're not going to have to run it for

So, I mean, we know from these things
So, I mean, we know from these things
now. We've got neural MMO 3. Actually, I
now. We've got neural MMO 3. Actually, I
haven't
haven't
run I do not remember the last neural
run I do not remember the last neural
mmo3 curve that I
mmo3 curve that I
ran. I should probably look at that real
quick. That's cool. Thank you.
quick. That's cool. Thank you.
I think so as
well. Okay. So
could have this guy
here currently
tracking. Little different actually from
tracking. Little different actually from
any of the other
curves. I don't mind leaving this on
curves. I don't mind leaving this on
overnight just
overnight just
running. See what it does.
The thing is we are totally at a point
The thing is we are totally at a point
where we should just be able to do like
where we should just be able to do like
a five bill
run. For whatever reason doesn't seem to
run. For whatever reason doesn't seem to
work super well.
Like what is
this? I wonder if there's an initial
this? I wonder if there's an initial
condition
problem. Like hang
problem. Like hang
on. If I just
Go look at these ones. This was the good
Go look at these ones. This was the good
one,
one,
right? I mean, there's like a first run
here. What was the first run?
take a few pages of
scrolling, but like I wonder if the
scrolling, but like I wonder if the
first run just was way better in this
first run just was way better in this
one for whatever
one for whatever
reason. No, they look the same,
right?
right?
Go up to 0 2 down a little bit. Yeah,
Go up to 0 2 down a little bit. Yeah,
very similar PF.
Not a first run
issue. If I go like eight of
issue. If I go like eight of
these, one of these actually does pretty
these, one of these actually does pretty
well. If I do like two pages of
these by 16 runs, no, it's actually
these by 16 runs, no, it's actually
still not like amazing.
Okay. So, you start to get runs like
Okay. So, you start to get runs like
when you get like 20 runs deep, you
when you get like 20 runs deep, you
start actually like getting some stuff
start actually like getting some stuff
that's not
that's not
terrible, but it's not great. That's
terrible, but it's not great. That's
really not great
really not great
either. So, I wonder if
either. So, I wonder if
um I wonder if it is literally just like
um I wonder if it is literally just like
the 10 samples versus five thing.
H bit irritating. If so, I definitely
H bit irritating. If so, I definitely
should have been more careful with uh
should have been more careful with uh
not breaking this benchmark because this
not breaking this benchmark because this
one is so good.
one is so good.
Like can we just take a moment here to
appreciate this
model? I forgot I did that.
Well, pull it at some
point
models. I'm trying to think what the
models. I'm trying to think what the
good like what a good plan is here.
good like what a good plan is here.
I think neural
I think neural
MMO3 is going to be a good target end
MMO3 is going to be a good target end
for testing DDP because it's got a
for testing DDP because it's got a
really long train curve that we know how
really long train curve that we know how
to like that we know that we should be
to like that we know that we should be
able to
able to
match. So like we'll run this tonight
match. So like we'll run this tonight
and then tomorrow when we get the
and then tomorrow when we get the
machines we'll try
DDP. That would be ideal.
I guess I could go check in on Spencer
I guess I could go check in on Spencer

So yeah, you kind of committed
So yeah, you kind of committed
uh different stuff in there, my
guy. That's fine. It's just voids
guy. That's fine. It's just voids
things. You should probably take a look

at the uh the new like go take a look at

the code for the convert environment for
the code for the convert environment for
voids by the way. Like I figured that
voids by the way. Like I figured that
when I was doing that end like that
when I was doing that end like that
would also help you out a
bit. What on
earth that
I just had a hummingbird do the most
I just had a hummingbird do the most
bizarre aerial acrobatics display I've

seen.
Okay. Cool things about having a bunch
Okay. Cool things about having a bunch
of wildlife outside the
window. But yeah, plasma, just check out
window. But yeah, plasma, just check out
um the convert environment. When I was
um the convert environment. When I was
writing it, I figured it would be a good
writing it, I figured it would be a good
reference for you as well. Like I knew
reference for you as well. Like I knew
you were already doing voids, but you're
you were already doing voids, but you're
having like a tough time getting stuff
having like a tough time getting stuff
to train. So I figured that would be a
to train. So I figured that would be a
good reference M. And we're all the for
good reference M. And we're all the for
reference, by the way, like we're going
reference, by the way, like we're going
to be doing a lot more swarming type M
to be doing a lot more swarming type M
soon. So that type of stuff is actually
soon. So that type of stuff is actually
quite
useful. Fix the voids.
Wait. Yo, how's this make any sense,
Wait. Yo, how's this make any sense,
man? Autotype is a function.
You passed a function
pointer, but that's not the type. This
pointer, but that's not the type. This
doesn't get called,
right? Type can take a
function.
Oh, I did not know that. Cool.
But it's still redundant,
right? Load is also a
function. Yeah, but that's cuz Python's
function. Yeah, but that's cuz Python's
a stupid language,
a stupid language,
right? Well, this this has this check in
right? Well, this this has this check in

here, right? So you it would just be
autotype, wouldn't it?
this fully fix it. I'm trying to think
Well, I'll merge this for now. So, thank

Thank you for

it's dramatically

what what is possibly different here?
You got to be a little careful with that
You got to be a little careful with that
like so that the way you convert is not

Is it like some difference in

And yes, this is this is literally

You removed logger.log

Tricky puzzle.
Let me just go check the um

I guess I like I could try

this. Like it's technically possible

this breaks it. I give it like a one in

This is the culprit.
I'd be very very surprised. Like I'd be

So literally nothing changes

trying to think what I could have

I already checked and I didn't mess with

I know it's a pure sweeps problem as
well. I mean, I think we got to go into
well. I mean, I think we got to go into
like
like
paranoid like paranoid mode
here. We go into super paranoid mode.
This could be it.
and I think it's literally just like
and I think it's literally just like
changing a mean

what? Kill this
We'll go to

paranoid, you know. We'll be fully fully

Those are all the thoughts I

grid.py. I guess technically it could be
grid.py. I guess technically it could be
a log change, but like I I don't think I

did anything weird with that. I really
don't would make more sense as like a
don't would make more sense as like a

Like this would like this would almost

be just as weird if it were

this. I mean that's slightly different
but not statistically different I'd
but not statistically different I'd
imagine, right?
What did I change the means
What did I change the means
to? Didn't I change it to something that

If I just look at like numbum M's or
If I just look at like numbum M's or
whatever the hell
here it's all on two, right?
here it's all on two, right?
And then like if I go
here, eight and then
four. It could just be too many wasted
four. It could just be too many wasted
runs, you know? Well, like they're
runs, you know? Well, like they're
mostly clustered at eight.
mostly clustered at eight.
I don't know how that
I don't know how that
happens. Like the type of bug that would

have to exist for this to be a thing is

very
bizarre. That's like super weird, right?
especially because like I know that you

can run the exact same params with the

If this is actually a fixed
It's something related to the way these

Whoops. I go seven runs.

got four runs on it. It could just be
like a stickiness thing, you
know, like having the lower range is

just sticky to eight.
I mean, this is kind of what I get for
I mean, this is kind of what I get for
not having random seeds. I mean, like
not having random seeds. I mean, like
not having I should clarify that. So,
not having I should clarify that. So,
like normally you seed um hyper pram

that is uniform random is sampling just
that is uniform random is sampling just
sucks for hyper pram sweeps. So, we just

don't do it.
don't do it.
um it like can help with stuff like

we've got some decent runs. I mean, I

then me went from two to eight and it

That was the only other real change I

that and returning the number of M's
that and returning the number of M's
like num ms to
4096 I mean I guess those are

substantially different ranges
right like on one of these you have one
right like on one of these you have one

vecend like one env
is going to be 1024 agents and the other
is going to be 1024 agents and the other
one is going to be 4096 agents and then
one is going to be 4096 agents and then
the top end is going to be 32k versus
16k. So even though the means are the
16k. So even though the means are the
same, it does change the
same, it does change the
sampling process a bit because
sampling process a bit because
like okay if you have like let's say you
like okay if you have like let's say you
have your mean of two and then you
have your mean of two and then you
sample a one you still have 40 96
sample a one you still have 40 96
agents right and if you sample like a

four then you have 16k agents whereas
four then you have 16k agents whereas
with
with
16 an eight mean like you could sample
16 an eight mean like you could sample
two and you only have 2k agents.
I guess also the
like when you have a mean of two, you're
like when you have a mean of two, you're
towards the bottom end of the
towards the bottom end of the
distribution. So like you're more likely

to sample upwards, I
guess, whereas in the other one here,
guess, whereas in the other one here,
you're likely to sample
you're likely to sample
downwards. I mean, this is such a subtle
downwards. I mean, this is such a subtle
change, though. Like, they should not be

never get a

go verify that real

Got like 20 second breakout somewhere
here. Yes. This is not the sub20.

in here, but
like they don't actually full solve, I
like they don't actually full solve, I
don't

Then we

I think it was the 123 for some
reason. So, this is a 24 second
reason. So, this is a 24 second
here. Pretty sure it's
the Yeah, it's right here. So this
sweep was where we got the sub20. 20.
Okay. So, here are the
runs and let's see if we can
confirm my uh my suspicions
here. like this run right
here. Here's the commit stamp.
Huh. Interestingly, this is the same
commit as
commit as
before.
basically. So somehow this is how we got
basically. So somehow this is how we got
sub
20. This is the one.
Okay. So like uh
You know, this is actually not doing it
here. Did it just get lucky with the
point4? I have it like virtually
point4? I have it like virtually
identical here.
like a much stronger start as well.
There's still so much outfit in these
hypers. Got two different diffs
here. These are two different commits.
I didn't add like any other defaults or
I didn't add like any other defaults or
anything either. It is straight up just
anything either. It is straight up just
this this and then
this this and then
grid any
again. It repros. That's the weirdest
again. It repros. That's the weirdest
thing. It's not like I broke some other
thing. It's not like I broke some other
thing and now the run doesn't repro. It
thing and now the run doesn't repro. It
repros perfectly, but the sweep doesn't
repros perfectly, but the sweep doesn't
find
it. And it's not like broken sweeps
it. And it's not like broken sweeps
either. It actually will sweep and like
either. It actually will sweep and like
find decent enough runs, but they don't
find decent enough runs, but they don't
look the same, do they?
look the same, do they?
Maybe it is a log frequency [ __ ]
Maybe it is a log frequency [ __ ]
thing. Let me
see.
Like okay, here's maze
full. And then here is
for my
grid. These are how different these
grid. These are how different these
sweeps look,
right? They're pretty
chaotic. But so are
chaotic. But so are
these. I mean, we immediately we notice
these. I mean, we immediately we notice
the difference in
the difference in
length. 100 mil. Yeah. See, this has way
length. 100 mil. Yeah. See, this has way
more long
runs. Seven. And then this gets to one
runs. Seven. And then this gets to one
almost.
Like this still has some dumb
runs. I kind of want to
see. Apparently this is two separate
see. Apparently this is two separate
sweeps.
right? So this is the
cost and we have to like do this
shenanigans
shenanigans
173. Yeah. So, this like never ran
173. Yeah. So, this like never ran
anything expensive at
anything expensive at
all. Like at all at all. Never ran
all. Like at all at all. Never ran
anything
anything
expensive. And then this thing

stuff. Major difference.
Why does it look like time steps caps at

half of sweeps.
This is 12:00 p.m. to 10:00
a.m. Wait,
a.m. Wait,
12. Yeah. So, they both take 10
hours. Kind of weird with how some of
hours. Kind of weird with how some of
those runs are like way shorter.
mess something
up. Yeah. See, this doesn't work still.
Hang on. Is this quite
different? How many of these are we
running? Eight.
Wait, we start at 8 and then from to
810 or rather let's go to 8:20. We do 1

reasonable runs by 8:20 p.m. So we go 20
reasonable runs by 8:20 p.m. So we go 20
minutes ahead is going to be like
here 16. Yeah, now these are

reasonable. There's not like some jank
reasonable. There's not like some jank
timing difference.
you'd kind of expect there to be, but

This down sample is the same. We didn't

It's just 5 versus 10 which we already

because because they're run

with the
with the

I already matched the spaces
exactly. Could it literally be

Right. I mean, like technically though,

N man, this is like it's too big of a

Okay. Have time steps.
It's running stuff for

I'm trying to think what's the
I'm trying to think what's the
likelihood that I have a screw up versus

very fiddly.
Okay. I

is the sweep the sweep results. They're

still working, but they're not matching
still working, but they're not matching
the previous sweep results. So, I'm
the previous sweep results. So, I'm
trying to see if I changed anything in
trying to see if I changed anything in
sweep defaults. And I changed a few very
sweep defaults. And I changed a few very
minor things, but I like it doesn't seem
minor things, but I like it doesn't seem
to make a huge

difference. But I'm trying to figure out
difference. But I'm trying to figure out
what are the odds that like the sweeps
what are the odds that like the sweeps
are just kind of fiddly and like, you
are just kind of fiddly and like, you
know, maybe sometimes it takes 200 runs,

sometimes it takes 400
sometimes it takes 400

um like did I actually break something?
The thing is that before now there has

And this is the bad
one. So the y ais on this one goes to
7. Give
7. Give

I mean the point is this one this is a

178 run sweep. Look you can see that
178 run sweep. Look you can see that
within 50 or so experiments it's like
within 50 or so experiments it's like

We didn't mess with hypers up here,

like
Default beep config

do take
do take

Not necessarily that either.
Okay. So, I think what I'm leaning to

There is actually a correlation. That's
funny. Leave these in.

I'll run that experiment after this

a param that works like relatively well
a param that works like relatively well
so I don't have to just keep on sweeping
so I don't have to just keep on sweeping
every time I make a new change.
Um, well, it kind of depends how much

you change the end.
Well, yeah. I mean, if I change ops, I

Uh yeah. Um, I did make some progress
Uh yeah. Um, I did make some progress
though, but
though, but
uh I think there's still improvement to

be made. Um, I kind of got to like
be made. Um, I kind of got to like
a I got one model learning better than
a I got one model learning better than
it was, but I also added just like a ton
it was, but I also added just like a ton
of prams to the model size. And I feel
of prams to the model size. And I feel
like you shouldn't have to train seven
like you shouldn't have to train seven
billion steps on Pac-Man or whatever.

Yeah. Yeah. I saw that seven billion
Yeah. Yeah. I saw that seven billion

it it it uh it looks pretty good. Have
it it it uh it looks pretty good. Have
you run a sweep?
you run a sweep?
I I have not run a sweep. Okay. Cuz I
I I have not run a sweep. Okay. Cuz I
swept cuz I got I showed you the model I
swept cuz I got I showed you the model I
got from Pac-Man. And this was the old

to make it like actually doable. I did
to make it like actually doable. I did
change the mechanics. So, like on the
change the mechanics. So, like on the
old version of
old version of
Pac-Man, I got 200 experiments for
Pac-Man, I got 200 experiments for

I think this is like 160 170ish

you can see the disparity here in all
you can see the disparity here in all
these runs.

Yeah, that's a pretty wide range. So,
Yeah, that's a pretty wide range. So,
like the point here is if you're just
like the point here is if you're just
like using some defaults,
like using some defaults,
right, you should just run sweep.
right, you should just run sweep.
Yeah. No, I I think I think I could you

I don't know. I I think Pac-Man might be

the thing is the aisle is really good.
Like if this were like a year ago, sure.

But like now it's like the RL is really

Yeah, it's definitely doable. I will say

that it could be that our there could be

um everything that you can pick up on
um everything that you can pick up on
the map is a one hot. Um so it's like
the map is a one hot. Um so it's like
it's a it's a a one if there is a thing
it's a it's a a one if there is a thing
there and it's a zero if there is not a
there and it's a zero if there is not a

thing there. Um but the ghosts and the
Asian are handled differently.
Asian are handled differently.
Um, so the the ghosts are the absolute
Um, so the the ghosts are the absolute
position of the ghost and then it's the
position of the ghost and then it's the
absolute position of the agent. Um, and
absolute position of the agent. Um, and
then there's a few other random one hots
then there's a few other random one hots
in there like if a ghost can move in a
in there like if a ghost can move in a
direction that's onehotted. Um, so like
direction that's onehotted. Um, so like
north, south, east, west. Um, if a ghost

that's a one hot. Yeah, the apps

It is normalized between

like we could totally do drone stuff if
like we could totally do drone stuff if
we wanted to out of this, right?
we wanted to out of this, right?
Yeah, 100%. We just got to make sure
Yeah, 100%. We just got to make sure
things don't hit each other.
All right, I'm going to do that at some
All right, I'm going to do that at some
point. I got to get this dumb release
point. I got to get this dumb release
done. It's driving me
done. It's driving me
nuts. There just so many like shitty
nuts. There just so many like shitty
experiments and things to check.
Yeah, I'm hoping that after the latest
Yeah, I'm hoping that after the latest
sweep, I should have like pretty god
sweep, I should have like pretty god
tier GPU drive params on a fixed set of
tier GPU drive params on a fixed set of
maps. And then I still got to somehow
maps. And then I still got to somehow
figure out why resampling is like not
figure out why resampling is like not
working,
working,
but I know it shouldn't be like an issue
but I know it shouldn't be like an issue
on a fixed set. Fix set is going to be
on a fixed set. Fix set is going to be
like for sure 100%
solved because I got one set of maps
solved because I got one set of maps
that got to like 999 and like 0.002 or
that got to like 999 and like 0.002 or
something like that. Like it was like
something like that. Like it was like
good enough.
I really like this
end. It's just so cool to
watch. I uh I really like your your
watch. I uh I really like your your
snake, too. The multi-agent snake. Snake
snake, too. The multi-agent snake. Snake
is really cool. Yeah, it's uh it's a lot
is really cool. Yeah, it's uh it's a lot
of fun to watch that one.
I was thinking about doing a continuous
I was thinking about doing a continuous
version of it as well. It would just be
version of it as well. It would just be
like substantially harder to make that
like substantially harder to make that
fast, I believe.
What do you mean by continuous here?
What do you mean by continuous here?
Like continuous positions like the
Like continuous positions like the
positions here are
Gotcha. Like oh man, like the merging
Gotcha. Like oh man, like the merging
behavior on these is so cool. like how
behavior on these is so cool. like how
they like split and
merge. So
merge. So
cool. And just like the fact that they
cool. And just like the fact that they
have a turning
have a turning
radius, you get like all these like
radius, you get like all these like
knots and
knots and
stuff and like occasionally half the
stuff and like occasionally half the
half of the one color of puffers end up
half of the one color of puffers end up
in one spot and half end up in another
in one spot and half end up in another
and then they end up merging.
Almost makes me think of well like a
Almost makes me think of well like a
school of fish, you know. Well, it is a
school of fish, you know. Well, it is a
school of fish. Yeah.
Um, do you have predators in that? Like
Um, do you have predators in that? Like
I see it's school of fish, but like you
I see it's school of fish, but like you
should put predators in there.
should put predators in there.
Some swarming. It's just fish that are
Some swarming. It's just fish that are
attempting to go to the the uh star that
attempting to go to the the uh star that
matches their color and then they change
matches their color and then they change
color when they get it.
Okay. I was going to say put like a
Okay. I was going to say put like a
dolphin in there and they have to avoid
dolphin in there and they have to avoid
dolphins too.
It's like crazy like they end up
like Captain's suggestion to have the
like Captain's suggestion to have the
goals move around was a really good
one cuz it like produces just these
one cuz it like produces just these
really different patterns.
I got to get the puffer model like the
I got to get the puffer model like the
3D file. We could do this in 3D.
Nice. That would be awesome.
probably not much harder in 3D.
probably not much harder in 3D.
Make it an actual puffer tank. Yeah,
you gave this one continuous uh
you gave this one continuous uh
positions, right? Yep.
Discrete actions for continuous
Discrete actions for continuous
positions.
positions.
Right. Right. Right.
Right. Right. Right.
And then
uh what was your vision like on this?
uh what was your vision like on this?
It's really easy. It's like really
It's really easy. It's like really
basic. You just do you just do relative
basic. You just do you just do relative
position of star? They just see the
position of star? They just see the
relative position of each like the
relative position of each like the
closest of each color of star.
closest of each color of star.
The closest of each color. Okay.
So basically all they have to learn
So basically all they have to learn
right they have to learn to match like
right they have to learn to match like
to map their color to star and then the
to map their color to star and then the
non-trivial part is that they have to
non-trivial part is that they have to
drag that like like simple onestep
drag that like like simple onestep
inference over the much longer pathing
horizon that make
horizon that make
sense like I don't understand so like
sense like I don't understand so like
actually pathing to the goal is like a
actually pathing to the goal is like a
manystep process right Sure.
manystep process right Sure.
The making the decision like the
The making the decision like the
decision of like I am X color so I
decision of like I am X color so I
choose X goal is a one-step decision.
choose X goal is a one-step decision.
So, it's like a kind of an interesting
So, it's like a kind of an interesting
thing where they have to like learn this
thing where they have to like learn this
decision and then they have to follow
decision and then they have to follow
through on it with all the pathing
through on it with all the pathing
[Music]
and then the fact that this just like
and then the fact that this just like
learns instantly with default hypers in
learns instantly with default hypers in
seconds. And just naturally with the
seconds. And just naturally with the
turning radius and the variation, you
turning radius and the variation, you
get like
get like
these and
these and
Like you you even get like a little bit
Like you you even get like a little bit
of separation even though there's no
of separation even though there's no
reward for
separation. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I wonder
separation. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I wonder
what it would be like if you decided to
what it would be like if you decided to
add
a I don't know, like a
a I don't know, like a
nearest if you're too close to a fish
nearest if you're too close to a fish
penalty, too.
penalty, too.
Yeah. I mean, then I would actually have
Yeah. I mean, then I would actually have
to do some engineering to make it fast
to do some engineering to make it fast
because then it gets like N squared with
because then it gets like N squared with
a ton of fish.
a ton of fish.
That's an Nbody problem. Yep.
That's something else. Well, can't you
That's something else. Well, can't you
make it fairly fixed and just check like
make it fairly fixed and just check like
five around you or something like that?
five around you or something like that?
Uh, you have to make it so that you can
Uh, you have to make it so that you can
only have a fixed number occupying each
only have a fixed number occupying each
cell or something, but then Yeah. Yeah.
cell or something, but then Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Do that. Yeah. Yeah. Because
Yeah. Yeah. Do that. Yeah. Yeah. Because
that's what I do on uh I do fixed
that's what I do on uh I do fixed
occupied
arrays for GPU drive stuff. Yeah. This
arrays for GPU drive stuff. Yeah. This
is a lot denser though with the number
is a lot denser though with the number
of agents.
of agents.
Sure. Sure. I mean, you have like a
Sure. Sure. I mean, you have like a
thousand agents.
thousand agents.
Yeah. And this is one of those things
Yeah. And this is one of those things
where like it just looks cooler the more
where like it just looks cooler the more
agents you have. So like if I were to
agents you have. So like if I were to
have like a zoomed out version of this
have like a zoomed out version of this
in 3D, it might want to be like 8,000
agents. I wonder if
agents. I wonder if
the policy
the policy
entropy controls the spread or if it's
entropy controls the spread or if it's
related to spread.
related to spread.
like just like a little bit a little bit
like just like a little bit a little bit
of variability and and how the policy
of variability and and how the policy
well they kind of move like fish as well
well they kind of move like fish as well
because like the control is like they
because like the control is like they
can only turn in certain
can only turn in certain
increments. So they actually if you like
increments. So they actually if you like
look at them they kind of like wobble
look at them they kind of like wobble
around a little like fish
do. That makes
sense. Came out very nicely.
sense. Came out very nicely.
What would be really satisfying is like
What would be really satisfying is like
if you're able to make this interactive
if you're able to make this interactive
somehow through the human side. Yeah.
somehow through the human side. Yeah.
Yeah. I'm going to do that at some
Yeah. I'm going to do that at some
point. I'll make it so like can like
point. I'll make it so like can like
click and drag all the fish to you or
click and drag all the fish to you or
something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
That's exactly what I was going for.
That's exactly what I was going for.
Yeah. Or like you can like right click
Yeah. Or like you can like right click
and like the fish will swim away from

you.
I don't know. Maybe we just maybe there

we could actually ship a Steam game
we could actually ship a Steam game

I feel like there's a steam game
I feel like there's a steam game

there's there's opportunity there. It's

I think one thing about RL for games,

be too good because that's not fun. You
be too good because that's not fun. You
don't want the human just to get stomped
don't want the human just to get stomped

you could do with that. Like you could

literally just like go back five
literally just like go back five

and go forward Yeah. and just go forward
five checkpoints every time they win.
That makes sense. There's so much dumb
That makes sense. There's so much dumb

What's funny is that's like a much
What's funny is that's like a much
simpler solution as opposed to doing

today and it really convinced me like
today and it really convinced me like
they weren't even doing anything
they weren't even doing anything
sophisticated. It's like it's actually
sophisticated. It's like it's actually
really convinced me that this form stuff
really convinced me that this form stuff
is just easy and like basically all the
is just easy and like basically all the
multi- aent stuff I was trying to do um
multi- aent stuff I was trying to do um
seven years ago it was actually totally
seven years ago it was actually totally
reasonable and just didn't work because
reasonable and just didn't work because
our infrastructure sucked.
That might make sense.
That might make sense.
That actually might be a good thing to
That actually might be a good thing to
think about as well, Spencer. Like like
think about as well, Spencer. Like like
specifically multi-agent problems
specifically multi-agent problems
because those are going to be the ones
because those are going to be the ones
where people have failed the hardest
where people have failed the hardest
before.
That's going to be your your instead of
That's going to be your your instead of
just putting the dirt down, you're going
just putting the dirt down, you're going
to have dump trucks that come and take
to have dump trucks that come and take
it away.
I mean, that would just straight up
I mean, that would just straight up
work.
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I I got to think
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, I I got to think
about like what what subsets of
about like what what subsets of
industries benefit most from multi- aent
industries benefit most from multi- aent
type problems.
Well, the thing is you have to get a
Well, the thing is you have to get a
little flexible with what an agent
little flexible with what an agent
is. I think
is. I think
uh details
uh details
well like technically these puffers
well like technically these puffers
like if you consider each star is like a
like if you consider each star is like a
resource, right? Then the puffers are
resource, right? Then the puffers are
like and the puffers are like just
like and the puffers are like just
routing resource like one to another.
routing resource like one to another.
These could be like delivery bots. I
These could be like delivery bots. I
mean they can approximate freaking
mean they can approximate freaking
conveyor belts like Yeah. Yeah. I see
conveyor belts like Yeah. Yeah. I see
what you're saying.
That's the factorial of right. I mean,
That's the factorial of right. I mean,
I've been playing Satisfactory. Yo,
I've been playing Satisfactory. Yo,
Spencer, the uh the non-automated
Spencer, the uh the non-automated
factory idea turned out to just be
factory idea turned out to just be
incredibly stupid. At least the way I
incredibly stupid. At least the way I
did it was incredibly stupid. So,
did it was incredibly stupid. So,
lo and behold,
lo and behold,
I won't share that concept with them.
I won't share that concept with them.
Yeah,
Yeah,
what was that concept? The concept was I
what was that concept? The concept was I
just made I made like a bunch of modules
just made I made like a bunch of modules
where it's like the same module and all
where it's like the same module and all
it does is it has a bunch of containers
it does is it has a bunch of containers
where you put in inputs and a bunch of
where you put in inputs and a bunch of
containers where the outputs go and like
containers where the outputs go and like
but the thing is it doesn't actually
but the thing is it doesn't actually
like route to any other module. So the
like route to any other module. So the
idea was just that like you have each
idea was just that like you have each
thing build a ton of one thing and then
thing build a ton of one thing and then
every so often you just manually move
every so often you just manually move
the outputs to the inputs of the
the outputs to the inputs of the
whatever the next thing is and then like
whatever the next thing is and then like
you can just reuse modules for like
you can just reuse modules for like
making whatever one thing that you want.
making whatever one thing that you want.
Um yeah, that idea sucked for a few
Um yeah, that idea sucked for a few
reasons. One of which is a bug in in the
reasons. One of which is a bug in in the
game which causes the conveyor belt to
game which causes the conveyor belt to
jam uh when you do that. So that one's
jam uh when you do that. So that one's
not on me. Yeah, there's a bug that
not on me. Yeah, there's a bug that
caused the conveyor belts to jam. And uh
caused the conveyor belts to jam. And uh
the other thing was just that like you
the other thing was just that like you
need a lot of input materials to get
need a lot of input materials to get
this whole thing started. So for a long
this whole thing started. So for a long
time you're just like manually moving
time you're just like manually moving
like a few stacks and you're just kind
like a few stacks and you're just kind
of like running around for a long time
of like running around for a long time
to get the thing started. Um, and it's
to get the thing started. Um, and it's
also like really easy to like the
also like really easy to like the
modules are big, so it's actually pretty
modules are big, so it's actually pretty
difficult to keep track of like what
difficult to keep track of like what
each of your 16 modules or whatever is
each of your 16 modules or whatever is
doing at any one time.
Uh, you say you're just making a factory
Uh, you say you're just making a factory
that is not automated. Yeah, that was
that is not automated. Yeah, that was
the idea. What? Interesting. Well, the
the idea. What? Interesting. Well, the
thing is because otherwise you have to
thing is because otherwise you have to
like get all these dumb ratios right
like get all these dumb ratios right
from like one machine to the next
from like one machine to the next
machine or and like the thing that was
machine or and like the thing that was
cool is I basically I've had to like it
cool is I basically I've had to like it
it I got around that because they didn't
it I got around that because they didn't
all get routed like directly together.
all get routed like directly together.
You actually didn't have to really worry
You actually didn't have to really worry
about the ratios much at all.
Uh interesting.
Uh interesting.
Is satisfactory on Mac? I don't think it

it's actually kind of impressive how
it's actually kind of impressive how
like everything pretty much just runs on
like everything pretty much just runs on
Linux now off of Steam.
Linux now off of Steam.
Yeah. Well, it's become pretty back in
Yeah. Well, it's become pretty back in
the day there was not much. I I wouldn't

go that. Not everything. It's pretty
go that. Not everything. It's pretty
good, right? It's obviously on
good, right? It's obviously on
everything, but it's Oh, but they're
everything, but it's Oh, but they're
very very intentionally. The best part
very very intentionally. The best part
about Linux is that it doesn't run
about Linux is that it doesn't run
League or Valerant, so I can't become
League or Valerant, so I can't become
completely addicted.

Like, yeah, I think so. You think you

That's just skill issue. Sorry guys.
Yeah, it is not. Well, it is. But yeah,

they're just, you know, pretty pretty
they're just, you know, pretty pretty
torn between having to micromanage the

No, that's like he plays old school PK.
No, that's like he plays old school PK.
That is the only way he plays. Oh man.

So actually yo I was thinking of what if
So actually yo I was thinking of what if
you just took that and then ported that
you just took that and then ported that
like 100 line one to CUDA. Can you do
like 100 line one to CUDA. Can you do
that? Yo that hey that guy would that
that? Yo that hey that guy would that
actually work if you just took like the
actually work if you just took like the
100 line emulator and like pasted it
100 line emulator and like pasted it
into CUDA? I know it's I mean and then
into CUDA? I know it's I mean and then
just like numbum threads equals num m
basically like couldn't that just
work? No
work? No
clue. You spent a lot of time optimizing
clue. You spent a lot of time optimizing
the thing. Maybe that's like the way to
the thing. Maybe that's like the way to
go is you just freaking
op
codes. Well, the point is that you're
codes. Well, the point is that you're
not really emulating a CP. You're
not really emulating a CP. You're
emulating a ridiculously slow CPU,
emulating a ridiculously slow CPU,
right? But then like you have a bunch of
right? But then like you have a bunch of
threads because you're running the same
threads because you're running the same
emulator. So like you would run like 4K
emulator. So like you would run like 4K

last last thing I heard, you were like,
last last thing I heard, you were like,
"Oh, my knee hurts. Can't do this. Can't
"Oh, my knee hurts. Can't do this. Can't

presses. Yeah. So, I It was kind of

awkward. Like I went I went to go do my

I got off balance somehow and I like to

from like seated overhead. Weird. I

about it is like right before that so I

It's probably some weird like
It's probably some weird like
somehow weirdly integrated use or other

therefore doesn't matter. Ah yes I

It's also worth questioning, is the
