right hope
not okay there's a whole bunch of stuff
not okay there's a whole bunch of stuff
to catch up on here um I think that the
to catch up on here um I think that the
initial thing I was told is that I just
initial thing I was told is that I just
had to pointed to the wrong container
had to pointed to the wrong container
and that there were a few issues with
and that there were a few issues with
setup
setup
tools go to the docks here
okay so apparently I just messed up the
okay so apparently I just messed up the
docker file which is kind of
weird cuz if people are getting the
weird cuz if people are getting the
instructions off the
instructions off the
website I am on 2 did I remember to
website I am on 2 did I remember to
update the doer 22 though I might have
update the doer 22 though I might have
not updated the default Branch that's
not updated the default Branch that's
like a common screw up of mine
tank ah I am
tank ah I am
dumb
so yeah that that was just really stupid
so yeah that that was just really stupid
uh
do I not have a two-
Branch I should have a two
Branch I should have a two
Branch oh I never pushed
it well that will do
it well that will do
it oh my God I don't know how I messed
it oh my God I don't know how I messed
that up
there's always something just stupid
there's always something just stupid
that you forget you know and it's this
that you forget you know and it's this
is the thing that sucks about having to
is the thing that sucks about having to
go straight from a release to a
go straight from a release to a
conference is like this only takes me a
conference is like this only takes me a
few minutes to figure out what I've done
few minutes to figure out what I've done
but that's like when I'm fresh and
but that's like when I'm fresh and
rested and not thinking about a million
rested and not thinking about a million
conference things like I could very
conference things like I could very
easily like be spinning my wheels not

token not on the uh stream window
token not on the uh stream window
obviously and then the actual the puffer
obviously and then the actual the puffer
tank thing will work so technically the
tank thing will work so technically the
puffer tank container was uploaded uh
puffer tank container was uploaded uh
you just had to point to it manually but
you just had to point to it manually but
I forgot to upload the Bas Docker file
I forgot to upload the Bas Docker file
so I had the image but not the container
so I had the image but not the container
my bad I will fix that up right
now it's really awesome just to see the

at least 10 and then this happens
at least 10 and then this happens
so give me a star for Christmas please
so give me a star for Christmas please
helps us a
helps us a
lot let me get out let me get the
lot let me get out let me get the
key I'll tell you what you start the
key I'll tell you what you start the
repository and I'll get you a working
repository and I'll get you a working
container right
now I really don't know how I messed
now I really don't know how I messed
that
that
up I just like straight up forgot to

actually do I have one of these already
actually do I have one of these already
I might actually have a CH already
oh don't have one I got to get a new

like yeah that's I'm not going to mess
like yeah that's I'm not going to mess
up that badly
up that badly
guys if anything like I'm not going to
guys if anything like I'm not going to
submit code that's fundamentally broken
submit code that's fundamentally broken
at the most I'll have like forgotten to
at the most I'll have like forgotten to
check in a specific like file or
check in a specific like file or
something or I'll have like added a bad
something or I'll have like added a bad
build system
okay so now this should
work
work
boom now we go make this the default
boom now we go make this the default
rench and we will be
good and I will test it as well before I
good and I will test it as well before I
go tweet it
very good
so
now I think we'll do um a clean build of
now I think we'll do um a clean build of
this or a clean version of
this or a clean version of
this just to make sure that you guys
this just to make sure that you guys
actually have everything really easy out
actually have everything really easy out
of the
box uh we're going to name
box uh we're going to name
this puffer
test Docker command not
found oh well that's because I'm in the
found oh well that's because I'm in the

already that's no big
deal just going to install Vim on this
deal just going to install Vim on this
because no we'll just go do
this because
yeah this
port Oh I thought that I
had ah okay already
had ah okay already
exists you know I can just stop the
exists you know I can just stop the
previous container that's that's going
previous container that's that's going
to be easier
so we'll make sure that this
so we'll make sure that this
works maybe I'll tell some ner stories
works maybe I'll tell some ner stories
