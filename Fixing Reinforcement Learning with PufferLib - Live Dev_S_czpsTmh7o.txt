is the X streaming thing fixed oh
look okay so they do all have to go into
look okay so they do all have to go into
one scene perfect thank you
one scene perfect thank you
Alexi
um yeah yeah cool X streaming is back
um yeah yeah cool X streaming is back
working great it was broken
working great it was broken
before happy 720 on a
before happy 720 on a
Thursday we are whoops don't need to
that we got code review to do for bet
that we got code review to do for bet
whenever he's back and in the
whenever he's back and in the
meantime we can look at some experiments
meantime we can look at some experiments
let's do
let's do
that oh there he
that oh there he
is
is
cool that is
cool that is
here I will take a quick look at
here I will take a quick look at
experiments in the meantime
never made it to exercise
never made it to exercise
ridiculous man you got to do your
ridiculous man you got to do your
exercise not
optional okay so
optional okay so
here we got our carbs red um
I'm trying to think what graph I can
log I basically want to see if carbs is
log I basically want to see if carbs is
getting better over time during the
getting better over time during the
sweep and it's a little tricky because
sweep and it's a little tricky because
like some of these points let me see
like some of these points let me see
make sure this is showing yeah okay so
make sure this is showing yeah okay so
some of
yeah so some of these
yeah so some of these
points right on sweet progress uh they
points right on sweet progress uh they
might be over here or something which is
might be over here or something which is
on the Paro
on the Paro
Frontier I'm trying to think how to see
Frontier I'm trying to think how to see
this
um what metric should I log
it's not going to be linear so I can't
it's not going to be linear so I can't
do
like the plots are only 2D
like the plots are only 2D
right I think 3D is a stupid thing to do
right I think 3D is a stupid thing to do
but yeah it's only 2D
anyways oh
I'm trying to think
it's kind of late let me just let's just
it's kind of late let me just let's just
make sure I'm not being
make sure I'm not being
stupid I doubt I am being stupid but
stupid I doubt I am being stupid but
let's see if there's an obvious answer
let's see if there's an obvious answer
I'm
missing
e e
yeah that doesn't freaking help
okay so I'm not being stupid this is
okay so I'm not being stupid this is
just there's no obvious answer to this
um
H actually you know what would work is
H actually you know what would work is
the
the
coloration is there a way to color the
coloration is there a way to color the
points
if you could just color the points to be
um you know hot to cold or something
um you know hot to cold or something
then you'd see over
time so you get scatter
time so you get scatter
chart hey bet
chart hey bet
okay so this is a chart that I can make
okay so this is a chart that I can make
but not a chart that I can make in
but not a chart that I can make in
Neptune I
think let me test now let's do your code
think let me test now let's do your code
review thing right um You can do that
review thing right um You can do that
another time I think that it's I think
another time I think that it's I think
it's correct anyways
okay
okay
good let's get your code reviewed so you
good let's get your code reviewed so you
changed a bunch of stuff on
changed a bunch of stuff on
Duro and you fix some things in Blaster
right like to get Blaster just added
right like to get Blaster just added
that'd be a nice thing to
do yes did you change Blaster yet or
no can we get yeah
sure BL that's
sure BL that's
fine let me figure out how to do this
uh okay I have desktop
audio let see if this
audio let see if this
works hey
works hey
bet yo yo I think that this setup should
bet yo yo I think that this setup should
work um
cool lots and lots of cool lots of
cool lots and lots of cool lots of
progress this week lots and lots of
progress this week lots and lots of
progress this week
progress this week
um yeah been
um yeah been
busy yeah yeah I'm super busy too I
busy yeah yeah I'm super busy too I
don't know if I made a lot of progress
don't know if I made a lot of progress
but uh Blaster will be refactored
but uh Blaster will be refactored
shortly fix this let me just check to
shortly fix this let me just check to
make sure I
haven't we got quotes for the new
haven't we got quotes for the new
machines we got
machines we got
uh ma major stuff done for two academic
uh ma major stuff done for two academic
labs
excellent how how much uh how much is
excellent how how much uh how much is
one of those
one of those
running what the machines uh about
running what the machines uh about
5600 I see is that with like a ryen or
5600 I see is that with like a ryen or
yeah that's top end
yeah that's top end
everything
cool okay uh let's figure
cool okay uh let's figure
out what to look at codewise
out what to look at codewise
uh I'm probably just going to do this
uh I'm probably just going to do this
live yep do it up I got uh where should
live yep do it up I got uh where should
I look join your stream on sorry I'm to
I look join your stream on sorry I'm to
join your stream on X here real quick X
join your stream on X here real quick X
twitch YouTube whatever do this [ __ ] no
twitch YouTube whatever do this [ __ ] no
no I'm in there on Twitch but I want to
no I'm in there on Twitch but I want to
be it in on uh yeah let me know if the
be it in on uh yeah let me know if the
audio works there and if it does then
audio works there and if it does then
you're going to want to mute it because
you're going to want to mute it because
you hear the Discord audio oh yeah I've
you hear the Discord audio oh yeah I've
already got
already got
muted hopefully it's not echoing and
muted hopefully it's not echoing and
[ __ ] but yep I sound great we sound
[ __ ] but yep I sound great we sound
great okay good audio is working
great okay good audio is working
wonderful cool uh right minimize
wonderful cool uh right minimize
that so where should I look here pop
that so where should I look here pop
this [ __ ] out uh you're it's p PR just
this [ __ ] out uh you're it's p PR just
look at your P request oh there just go
look at your P request oh there just go

lib yeah yeah that's
lib yeah yeah that's
fine okay let's
fine okay let's
see uh let me make sure this is covered
let me let me move this I do like I'll
let me let me move this I do like I'll
do this for
now
oops we'll do this for for code
review
review
cool okay
cool okay
and okay so somehow
this is
this is
down 6 700 lines okay actually that's
down 6 700 lines okay actually that's
kind of about what I expected so it's
kind of about what I expected so it's
not a lot sorry there's a rebeat there
not a lot sorry there's a rebeat there
so this is only 40
so this is only 40
lines
lines
okay yeah we don't really care too much
okay yeah we don't really care too much
about the read I know
about the read I know
um okay so let's see what you did
um okay so let's see what you did
here got rid of Malik good you shouldn't
here got rid of Malik good you shouldn't
be malaking
add
logs
um do not need c
render uh I got rid of the
render uh I got rid of the
c i you kept it on step but you might
c i you kept it on step but you might
want to put it back we I added this to
want to put it back we I added this to
all environments see reset cstep and C
all environments see reset cstep and C
render uh so I actually I figured out
render uh so I actually I figured out
the source of that it's not a problem
the source of that it's not a problem
with our with the code at all it's an
with our with the code at all it's an
utterly stupid problem with cond C
utterly stupid problem with cond C
compiler which like a bunch of people
compiler which like a bunch of people
use uh there's no way that I can see
use uh there's no way that I can see
around it so I changed it in all
around it so I changed it in all
environments even though it's a really
environments even though it's a really
stupid fix so cond cond C compiler yep
stupid fix so cond cond C compiler yep
it's horribly broken code and by the way
it's horribly broken code and by the way
even if you compile even once you get it
even if you compile even once you get it
working the compile like 3x lower than
working the compile like 3x lower than
with normal GCC so I have absolutely no
with normal GCC so I have absolutely no
idea what they're doing but uh I added C
idea what they're doing but uh I added C
underscore to everything just the step
underscore to everything just the step
render and reset functions are
render and reset functions are
enough yeah why uh why it so I I don't
enough yeah why uh why it so I I don't
recall compiling with with that compiler
recall compiling with with that compiler
though
though
uh you were getting that bug somewhere
uh you were getting that bug somewhere
else the the bug the bug exists
else the the bug the bug exists
uh it exists you know
all G GCC just I tested it I tested it
all G GCC just I tested it I tested it
with GCC and I tested the old versions
with GCC and I tested the old versions
of GCC as well on W on

WSL uh not on WSL but WSL should be the

same as native Linux I think it's I
think it has something to do with WSL
think it has something to do with WSL
because
because
specifically uh specifically it seems I
specifically uh specifically it seems I
know I know linky had a problem as well
know I know linky had a problem as well
uh he was the one that discovered the
uh he was the one that discovered the
bug and it's a compiler bug either way
bug and it's a compiler bug either way
yeah but a lot of people don't have it
yeah but a lot of people don't have it
too so yeah I I just I did it anyways
too so yeah I I just I did it anyways
but um you got to be careful because I
but um you got to be careful because I
don't know what compiler it is that's
don't know what compiler it is that's
breaking but it seems that it's way
breaking but it seems that it's way
slower as well uh and I I messed with
slower as well uh and I I messed with
the flags a whole bunch it was also
the flags a whole bunch it was also
injecting a bunch of garbage compile
injecting a bunch of garbage compile
Flags but I couldn't reproduce like I
Flags but I couldn't reproduce like I
could not get it to be fast even with
could not get it to be fast even with
good flag lags so I don't know anyways
good flag lags so I don't know anyways

whatever it's not not the worst thing
whatever it's not not the worst thing

have some key press

uh let's
see game
state so you got rid of some stuff let's
state so you got rid of some stuff let's
see got rid of a bunch of I wish I could
see got rid of a bunch of I wish I could
I wish this freaking window worked cuz
I wish this freaking window worked cuz
it doesn't show me anything at the

restream there we

the chat window and the stats and stuff
they all break okay
they all break okay
good so let's see what you remember
good so let's see what you remember
moved here
um you still have all these
um you still have all these
indices
indices
and yellow digit off SC minp
speed player
X so you somehow removed a bunch of
X so you somehow removed a bunch of
variables from the game State yep bunch
variables from the game State yep bunch
of variables gone bunch of do these live
of variables gone bunch of do these live
somewhere else now no oh cuz this is the
somewhere else now no oh cuz this is the
renderer they do not live somewhere else
renderer they do not live somewhere else
they're they're in endur now right yeah
they're they're in endur now right yeah
well they were in endur all and they
well they were in endur all and they
were getting copied over okay yeah yeah
were getting copied over okay yeah yeah
so you sto doing the weird like
so you sto doing the weird like
functional copy [ __ ] good I stopped
functional copy [ __ ] good I stopped
doing the weird functional copy [ __ ]
doing the weird functional copy [ __ ]
yeah okay you do not need to duplicate
yeah okay you do not need to duplicate
variables in multiple places that's just
variables in multiple places that's just
eror pron and stupid okay that's good
eror pron and stupid okay that's good
that's a good fix um and then but
that's a good fix um and then but
they're also fewer variables in here
they're also fewer variables in here
now yeah there's I'm curious as to how
now yeah there's I'm curious as to how
you got rid of
you got rid of
these uh let me see
here like some of these are constants
here like some of these are constants
like car with and car height yeah any
like car with and car height yeah any
anything constant is now a constant so
anything constant is now a constant so
that's up top now yep or car car width
that's up top now yep or car car width
and car height weren even weren't even
and car height weren even weren't even
being used I don't think I might have
being used I don't think I might have
made those removed a bunch of dumb [ __ ]
made those removed a bunch of dumb [ __ ]
that like was like from
that like was like from
yeah okay and then this like gear
yeah okay and then this like gear
threshold okay yeah these are constants
threshold okay yeah these are constants
okay I told you this so you pulled all
okay I told you this so you pulled all
the constants out to constants and
the constants out to constants and
removed all the random [ __ ] that you
removed all the random [ __ ] that you
didn't actually need yes
didn't actually need yes
correct
okay sure you can have an enem I don't
okay sure you can have an enem I don't
ever see the point of having enems but
ever see the point of having enems but
you can have one
you can have one
sure thanks
sure thanks
and
and
then the [ __ ] is all
then the [ __ ] is all
this it's a it's an asset map you want
this it's a it's an asset map you want
me to put in a different file I can do
me to put in a different file I can do
that no that doesn't need to go in a
that no that doesn't need to go in a
different
file because they're all on a Sprite
file because they're all on a Sprite
sheet and these are the dimensions they
sheet and these are the dimensions they
are all on a Sprite sheet and those are
are all on a Sprite sheet and those are
di that's fine yep that's totally
fine how do you know what the index is
fine how do you know what the index is
to
to
use H how do you know what the index
use H how do you know what the index
is how but just making this spreadsheet
is how but just making this spreadsheet
and
and
then okay well we'll look at that I use
then okay well we'll look at that I use
a I use a spreadsheet uh Creator and I
a I use a spreadsheet uh Creator and I
very
very
painstakingly uh place I mean when you
painstakingly uh place I mean when you
access when you access
access when you access
them okay this is um before I was
them okay this is um before I was
mapping it to an Eno I just mapped it
mapping it to an Eno I just mapped it
directly you said this is this is better
directly you said this is this is better
the reason that this is better is
the reason that this is better is
because the reason this is better is
because the reason this is better is
because you had stupid [ __ ] like asset
because you had stupid [ __ ] like asset
digit 0 through n where this is really
digit 0 through n where this is really
like it's going to be like digits and
like it's going to be like digits and
then plus like an offset or something so
then plus like an offset or something so
having like enums for this is insane um
having like enums for this is insane um
so yeah I don't
so yeah I don't
know I'm curious how you're mapping it
know I'm curious how you're mapping it
when you have literally one of these
when you have literally one of these
sheets like I would think that this
sheets like I would think that this
would be like rectangle background map
would be like rectangle background map
and then that has 15 16 things and like
and then that has 15 16 things and like
Mountains map has 16 things or whatever
Mountains map has 16 things or whatever
so it's easier to index but we'll see
so it's easier to index but we'll see
how you're
how you're
indexing
indexing
yeah so I probably would have made this
yeah so I probably would have made this
like what is this four or five separate
like what is this four or five separate
Maps but if you have a good way of
Maps but if you have a good way of
indexing it's
indexing it's
fine uh client where' the client go
fine uh client where' the client go
all the prototypes are gone good they
all the prototypes are gone good they
you don't need prototypes all the
you don't need prototypes all the
prototypes are gone correct good yeah
prototypes are gone correct good yeah
you should not need
prototypes especially not for like a
prototypes especially not for like a
single file game
single file game
project um it's pretty pretty ug
project um it's pretty pretty ug
car get furthest Lane are these new
car get furthest Lane are these new
functions uh no those are not new okay
functions uh no those are not new okay
so you just moved them around a bit
so you just moved them around a bit
okay uh I don't know why the log but
okay uh I don't know why the log but
buffers way the hell down here but
buffers way the hell down here but
whatever Aggregate and
clear and you did uh you did my new
clear and you did uh you did my new
login style good yep that's fine that
login style good yep that's fine that
saves you some lines
saves you some lines
good now in nit well where did nit go
good now in nit well where did nit go
and it's under free
allocators so keep keep going
allocators so keep keep going
it'll be down okay so you just moved it
it'll be down okay so you just moved it
line 425 and now you have this net
line 425 and now you have this net
function which sets a billion variables
function which sets a billion variables
but I'm hoping that I'm not going to see
but I'm hoping that I'm not going to see
the same code twice because I saw it
the same code twice because I saw it
twice before you're not going to see
twice before you're not going to see
you're not going to see any duplications
you're not going to see any duplications
at all there are no so there's a bunch
at all there are no so there's a bunch
of obnoxious initialization here it is
of obnoxious initialization here it is
all necessary like it won't train if one
all necessary like it won't train if one
of them not initialize properly like
of them not initialize properly like
which is interesting because C zero all
which is interesting because C zero all
the things that are zeros but whatever I
the things that are zeros but whatever I
guess you use this to reset as well
guess you use this to reset as well
don't
don't
you uh yes I am dual purposing it that's
you uh yes I am dual purposing it that's
okay so that's use it to zero that's
okay so that's use it to zero that's
fine but where where where where would I
fine but where where where where would I
be celing everything it would probably
be celing everything it would probably
go in I mean it would probably if what I
go in I mean it would probably if what I
would do is I would probably stick most
would do is I would probably stick most
of this into reset instead of in in it
of this into reset instead of in in it
because it's like you're calling in it
because it's like you're calling in it
from reset which is kind of weird it
from reset which is kind of weird it
would be better to just put the stuff
would be better to just put the stuff
that you need to in it once here and
that you need to in it once here and
then the stuff that needs to be called
then the stuff that needs to be called
every time goes in reset um that would
every time goes in reset um that would
probably be a bit better but at least
probably be a bit better but at least
you're no longer calling everything
you're no longer calling everything
twice CU I think before you had yeah you
twice CU I think before you had yeah you
had everything in reset as well which
had everything in reset as well which
was obscene so this is at least
was obscene so this is at least
substantially
better quadratic yeah okay this stuff
better quadratic yeah okay this stuff
rodex i' I've already reviewed your code
rodex i' I've already reviewed your code
so I'm just looking for like major
so I'm just looking for like major
refactor
refactor
changes um
changes um
y yeah so I would still probably stick
y yeah so I would still probably stick
like the if you want to keep messing
like the if you want to keep messing
with stuff I would probably move all the
with stuff I would probably move all the
stuff that needs to be done on reset
stuff that needs to be done on reset
into here um and here's the thing it all
into here um and here's the thing it all

needs to be done basically on reset uh
like all of this stuff is well yeah but
like all of this stuff is well yeah but
I it's weird to have reset call a knit
I it's weird to have reset call a knit
like you're supposed to call a knit once
like you're supposed to call a knit once
and then you call reset whenever you
and then you call reset whenever you
need to reset so like if it all needs to
need to reset so like if it all needs to
be done on reset that just means that
be done on reset that just means that
like you don't really have an inip
like you don't really have an inip
function just have a reset function um

yeah so I guess it could be all moved to

around so you don't need prototypes good

um you removed like the crazy duplicated

what you did all right so you went and
what you did all right so you went and
constructed all these
constructed all these

offsets because you made one texture
array right correct okay look now you're

actually G to get something out of
this because this is
this because this is
stupid it's better than before but it's

still stupid
you're getting very direct code review
you're getting very direct code review
at this hour it's fine say whatever I've
at this hour it's fine say whatever I've
had I'm a little grumpy I had a four and

hours I will I will I will not be

offended I'm not good at coding okay so
offended I'm not good at coding okay so
look this [ __ ] right here all right this
look this [ __ ] right here all right this
is asset like this is asset mapcore BG
is asset like this is asset mapcore BG
all right and this [ __ ] right here is

asset map map
asset map map
and this [ __ ] right here is asset map
and this [ __ ] right here is asset map
digits right and this is green digits
digits right and this is green digits
and this is yellow digits and then you
and this is yellow digits and then you
don't have to compute any offsets at all
don't have to compute any offsets at all
because it's just going to be you know
because it's just going to be you know
background of index it will be 0 to 16
background of index it will be 0 to 16
right mountains 0 to 16 digits 0 to n or
right mountains 0 to 16 digits 0 to n or
10 whatever okay so and it'll be the

exact same
exact same
performance well hold on isn't this
performance well hold on isn't this
slightly more
slightly more
compact no it's not this is flat ma
compact no it's not this is flat ma
because because then you have all this
because because then you have all this
[ __ ] indexing logic at the bottom to
[ __ ] indexing logic at the bottom to
compute the
offsets so when you have like blocks of
offsets so when you have like blocks of
16 indices like that there's no reason
16 indices like that there's no reason
to flat map it like
that you can have like four or five
that you can have like four or five
different
different
Maps it's not more compact because you
Maps it's not more compact because you
have to do all this indexing
have to do all this indexing
Shenanigans like you wouldn't even here
Shenanigans like you wouldn't even here
let me find it for you
all right not only is it more
all right not only is it more
confusing but like where is it where's
confusing but like where is it where's
the stupid
thing okay so not only is this confusing
thing okay so not only is this confusing
as all hell but you don't even need
as all hell but you don't even need
these variables like these variables
these variables like these variables
would not be part of game State they
would not be part of game State they
would not
would not
exist because you wouldn't need the
exist because you wouldn't need the
indices because it's like if you just
indices because it's like if you just
wanted digit three it would just be
wanted digit three it would just be
three you wouldn't have to worry about
three you wouldn't have to worry about
these offsets so all this [ __ ] like
these offsets so all this [ __ ] like
right here like most of this code just
right here like most of this code just
gets
deleted rip there you go so that's this
deleted rip there you go so that's this
is how like if you think about your data
is how like if you think about your data
structures a little bit you end up with
structures a little bit you end up with
less garbage to have to do housekeeping
less garbage to have to do housekeeping
over okay clean up fine make make client
over okay clean up fine make make client
fine close why is there close client and
fine close why is there close client and
a
up don't don't make useless
up don't don't make useless
functions this is all just close client
functions this is all just close client
this there's no reason you would ever
this there's no reason you would ever
call this other than when you close the
client okay under

fine update car animation
scoreboard yeah like look all this this
scoreboard yeah like look all this this
like digit next you wouldn't need any of
like digit next you wouldn't need any of
the
[ __ ] under
background I'm the
scoreboard yeah so all this asset map
scoreboard yeah so all this asset map
stuff would be a lot easier cuz this
stuff would be a lot easier cuz this
current asset index X you wouldn't have
current asset index X you wouldn't have
this it would just be like score digit
this it would just be like score digit
minus one or
whatever they
whatever they
completed let's yeah so all this
completed let's yeah so all this
indexing stuff that's going to confuse
indexing stuff that's going to confuse
you would be like this would all be
you would be like this would all be
cleaned
up Victory update mountains
up Victory update mountains
cool
cool
mountains car index
good enemy car get Road color under
Road asset car index car asset index so
Road asset car index car asset index so
we had to compute get car texture index
we had to compute get car texture index
you had to do a whole bunch of stuff for
you had to do a whole bunch of stuff for
this color
okay and
then yeah it's kind of fine to have a
then yeah it's kind of fine to have a
function that looks like this this is
fine yeah that's the render clean
fine yeah that's the render clean
no that's fine
I mean it depends how long the function
I mean it depends how long the function
is
is
right it would be very long
yeah if this were like a 300 line
yeah if this were like a 300 line
function I would just make it a function
function I would just make it a function
with sections I would agree it's not 300
with sections I would agree it's not 300
lines well the question is could it be
lines well the question is could it be
lines I don't know no we'll see how much
lines I don't know no we'll see how much
shorter kits when we remove a bunch of
shorter kits when we remove a bunch of
indexing or [ __ ] but uh it'll be a
indexing or [ __ ] but uh it'll be a
little it'll be a little shorter but
little it'll be a little shorter but
probably not a ton shorter a lot of that
probably not a ton shorter a lot of that
a lot of that is the uh the
a lot of that is the uh the
score but you see how like you know your
score but you see how like you know your
brain can only handle so much code at a
brain can only handle so much code at a
time so if you write more code than you
time so if you write more code than you
need you don't not only do you have to
need you don't not only do you have to
deal with that code but then you have to
deal with that code but then you have to
add more structure to break it apart
add more structure to break it apart
because your brain can't handle that
because your brain can't handle that
much code so you end up with even more
much code so you end up with even more
garbage code so this is why like
garbage code so this is why like
programming skill is exponential because
programming skill is exponential because
like if you do stuff in the simplest and
like if you do stuff in the simplest and
the easiest way possible not only do you
the easiest way possible not only do you
avoid
avoid
the redundancy but you avoid the
the redundancy but you avoid the
structure to support the
structure to support the
redundancy yeah this is a this is a good
redundancy yeah this is a this is a good
Improvement uh I will say this is a good
Improvement uh I will say this is a good
Improvement I'm being very harsh uh not
Improvement I'm being very harsh uh not
really not not really what I would say
really not not really what I would say
is so what I want you to do is first of
is so what I want you to do is first of
all take your stupid auto form matter
all take your stupid auto form matter
and rerun it back to four spaces commit
and rerun it back to four spaces commit
that and then the next time you show me
that and then the next time you show me
a diff give me the diff from that
a diff give me the diff from that
version so that it doesn't destroy
version so that it doesn't destroy
everything again gotcha okay I've
everything again gotcha okay I've
already already done that so yeah so
already already done that so yeah so
make sure you do that and
make sure you do that and
then uh if you depending on how much
then uh if you depending on how much
more you want to keep refactoring so I
more you want to keep refactoring so I
don't know refactoring your code is a
don't know refactoring your code is a
really damn way good way to learn how to
really damn way good way to learn how to
get better at stuff so I personally
get better at stuff so I personally
would suggest that you keep doing little
would suggest that you keep doing little
bits here and there on the side if you
bits here and there on the side if you
get bored you know by all means do other
get bored you know by all means do other
projects but you know keep coming back
projects but you know keep coming back
to it here and there um because it's a
to it here and there um because it's a
really really good way to improve is
really really good way to improve is
just like polishing your code until it
just like polishing your code until it
no longer hurts your eyes
um yeah the indexing the most egregious
um yeah the indexing the most egregious
thing the most egregious thing I saw was
thing the most egregious thing I saw was
the way you're doing indexing that's the
the way you're doing indexing that's the
worst data structure that you
have as for like is there other
have as for like is there other
redundant logic I don't know I literally
redundant logic I don't know I literally
don't know I would have to like see the
don't know I would have to like see the
code put together after you know you
code put together after you know you
make these changes and fix the spacing
make these changes and fix the spacing
and everything else and then I would
and everything else and then I would
have to look through the like not the
have to look through the like not the
diff I'd have to look through the whole
diff I'd have to look through the whole
source file and see if I see anything
source file and see if I see anything
else to simplify right yeah because how
else to simplify right yeah because how
even even I can't tell [ __ ] from like
even even I can't tell [ __ ] from like
looking at just these diffs I guess
looking at just these diffs I guess
technically look technically I could do
technically look technically I could do
where is
where is
it technically I could do
it technically I could do
this and just see the
this and just see the
latest file okay so now we're down to
latest file okay so now we're down to
lines yeah get rid of this [ __ ] this
lines yeah get rid of this [ __ ] this
ridiculous um
constants are
fine I generally like don't put all the
fine I generally like don't put all the
strs together I see you put all the strs
strs together I see you put all the strs
together I generally put the methods
together I generally put the methods
that go with the strs with the strs so
that go with the strs with the strs so
like I put my logging with my logging um
like I put my logging with my logging um
yeah I saw that it's just like it's kind
yeah I saw that it's just like it's kind
of annoying otherwise
um got car
yeah so these indices are just going to
yeah so these indices are just going to
be gone right all these indices are just
be gone right all these indices are just
like
gone
gone
yeah I even this like even
yeah I even this like even
this like you don't need indices for
this like you don't need indices for
this index index yeah
this index index yeah
but be locally defined locally defined
but be locally defined locally defined
variable though right what yeah it'll
variable though right what yeah it'll
just need to be locally defined or you
just need to be locally defined or you
don't need the freaking indices at all
don't need the freaking indices at all
because look these These are only there
because look these These are only there
because you have offsets into a giant

won't even have to
won't even have to

exist I yeah I I understand it okay so
like a lot of the stuff in this game
like a lot of the stuff in this game

I guess this is a height offset so this
I guess this is a height offset so this
is
legit H yeah the um the the drawing of
legit H yeah the um the the drawing of
that is super complicated yeah I can buy
that is super complicated yeah I can buy
this is a
this is a

pain okay and then you have really bad
all this [ __ ] okay this is a big ass
all this [ __ ] okay this is a big ass

don't understand how this is like oh
this is the way that the format should

be it clearly looks like crap it's very

confusing to look at well you learned
confusing to look at well you learned
something don't use those I think these
something don't use those I think these

I'm pretty
I'm pretty
sure um they might be and this one gear
sure um they might be and this one gear
Gear speed threshold sounds very
Gear speed threshold sounds very
constant to me this sounds constant to
me so I mean this is a big struck there
me so I mean this is a big struck there
are a few things that can get out of it
are a few things that can get out of it
but yeah it's a big environment it's
but yeah it's a big environment it's
going to be a big struck whatever
um I don't really I don't really like
um I don't really I don't really like
the idea of like breaking apart a struck
the idea of like breaking apart a struck
just for the sake of breaking it apart
just for the sake of breaking it apart
if you're only going to use it once so I
if you're only going to use it once so I
think this is fine it's fine to have a
think this is fine it's fine to have a
big struct as long as all the stuff in
big struct as long as all the stuff in
the struct actually needed right like

don't need to be here um
OB size is definitely
OB size is definitely
constant I feel I feel like the top as
constant I feel I feel like the top as
well I feel like I removed it there was
well I feel like I removed it there was
an issue or something oh you can see I
an issue or something oh you can see I
put like all the constants at the top
put like all the constants at the top
now the exception here is if you're
now the exception here is if you're
going to put like the rayb rendering
going to put like the rayb rendering
stuff down with the rendering that's
stuff down with the rendering that's
fine I usually do that but I'd put like
fine I usually do that but I'd put like
all the actual constants up at the top
all the actual constants up at the top
enum is fine here I'd probably just
enum is fine here I'd probably just
pound a fine but en is
pound a fine but en is
fine this is now going to be like five
fine this is now going to be like five
or six different asset
or six different asset
Maps yes and you're GNA you'll actually
Maps yes and you're GNA you'll actually
save lines because you won't have all
save lines because you won't have all
the index in garbage I will refactor
the index in garbage I will refactor
that first we will we will see logs yeah
that first we will we will see logs yeah
i' put this back up with the logs right
i' put this back up with the logs right
and add log I put my Logs with logs
and add log I put my Logs with logs
breaks it
breaks it
up okay and then this allocate free in
up okay and then this allocate free in
it is good most of the init stuff would
it is good most of the init stuff would
probably go and
probably go and
reset
yeah yeah gotcha this a constant
yeah yeah gotcha this a constant
totally
um gear time over total
um gear time over total
time Min hold on
so so what I'm pretty sure this is I'm
so so what I'm pretty sure this is I'm
pretty sure that this is a very fancy
pretty sure that this is a very fancy
way of calculating a constant it is I'm
way of calculating a constant it is I'm
I'm almost certain like I'm pretty sure
I'm almost certain like I'm pretty sure
you could just calculate what this is
you could just calculate what this is
and then write as a constant because
and then write as a constant because
yeah yeah just looking at just looking
yeah yeah just looking at just looking
at it again now that you've yeah like
at it again now that you've yeah like
all this stuff pointed it out I did uh
all this stuff pointed it out I did uh
you know I basically what I just used
you know I basically what I just used
the litness test to see what was a class
the litness test to see what was a class
and what wasn't like is uh is the
and what wasn't like is uh is the
variable being changed at all if it's
variable being changed at all if it's
not then it doesn't need to be a
not then it doesn't need to be a
variable so and initialize that's
fine you have in both Pathways here you
fine you have in both Pathways here you
have
zeros you take all the shared variables
zeros you take all the shared variables
that are going to be zero either way and
that are going to be zero either way and
you put them outside the statement and
you put them outside the statement and
then you delete them from the
then you delete them from the
statements they're like small things
statements they're like small things
like this all over the
place this has got to be a
constant the previous daytime
constant the previous daytime
index total day duration there's no way
index total day duration there's no way
this is a constant
this is a constant
right well what's SEC so I think you're
right well what's SEC so I think you're
Computing some constants that that is
Computing some constants that that is
being that's just a placeholder variable
being that's just a placeholder variable
for computing a
for computing a
thing but I think that the thing is a
thing but I think that the thing is a
constant whatever the name's the name's
constant whatever the name's the name's
confusing so that's why you're so reset
confusing so that's why you're so reset
I think reset gets pretty big and in it
I think reset gets pretty big and in it
gets very
gets very
small most
likely yes we can I can I can switch it
likely yes we can I can I can switch it
to you the um and then reset doesn't
to you the um and then reset doesn't
call a net uh the the only the
call a net uh the the only the
only difference here is let's see an it
only difference here is let's see an it
is getting a

reset is not so for the reset
reset is not so for the reset
count uh when reset count is zero then

it should uh use a random seed for the

it doesn't

4,000 different environments is it four
4,000 different environments is it four
is it one environment with 4,000

get we need like this is what we need we

we fiddled with today only got it it's
we fiddled with today only got it it's
like 11,000 SPS is
like 11,000 SPS is
terrible oh what are these the are these
terrible oh what are these the are these
numbers with just like your just basic
numbers with just like your just basic
outline and then not doing anything or
outline and then not doing anything or
are they well I'm running puffer but the
are they well I'm running puffer but the
thing is the m is taking up 95% of the

right anyways I got something working at
right anyways I got something working at
the very
the very
least twitch folks
least twitch folks
um so okay the next thing I guess I
um so okay the next thing I guess I
wanted to look
wanted to look
at so I've been sitting on this for a
at so I've been sitting on this for a
couple days and I want to run some new
couple days and I want to run some new
experiments but I've got
experiments but I've got
it's annoying to me that you can't set
it's annoying to me that you can't set
this inside
this inside
of inside of
of inside of
Neptune I wish you could just set
Neptune I wish you could just set
the you should be able to set the dot
colors uh like how are you
colors uh like how are you
gonna arrange the dots or what what's I
gonna arrange the dots or what what's I
should be able to map them
should be able to map them
to uh to like a heat map like the hot to
to uh to like a heat map like the hot to
cold or whatever yes so what I would to
cold or whatever yes so what I would to
do is I would like to have along the
do is I would like to have along the
time I'd like to use the creation time
time I'd like to use the creation time
to do hot to
to do hot to
cold and then what would that would
cold and then what would that would
happen is I would be able to
happen is I would be able to
see on this Paro graph when the runs
see on this Paro graph when the runs
were made so if it starts off hot and
were made so if it starts off hot and
then gets colder right but if I see all
then gets colder right but if I see all
the blue the blue dots are on the parito
the blue the blue dots are on the parito
front then it's getting better over time
front then it's getting better over time
right yeah so what you'd like to see is
right yeah so what you'd like to see is
all the blue dots here and all the warm
all the blue dots here and all the warm
dots over here true but I can't [ __ ]
dots over here true but I can't [ __ ]
do that because they don't let you color
do that because they don't let you color
the plot so I'm trying to see if I want
the plot so I'm trying to see if I want
to do like more offline analysis I guess
to do like more offline analysis I guess
I mean the alternative thing is they did

my analysis offline like it would be

nice to just have that
nice to just have that
here I would agree with that um yeah

that'd be really good for hyper pram
that'd be really good for hyper pram
sweeps um okay so I will tell them I
sweeps um okay so I will tell them I
will talk to them about that Al so why
will talk to them about that Al so why
do I only have 57 runs
do I only have 57 runs
here
here
um what the heck is on what's what with
this there we
this there we
go
go
so yeah here are runs I mean I can see
so yeah here are runs I mean I can see
that we have a lot of good runs here at
that we have a lot of good runs here at
the least this is better than our random

search so this is our random where's it

like most of them are bad
I think we're well set up to
I think we're well set up to
do additional stuff from here though
do additional stuff from here though
um I would like to start a sweep of some
um I would like to start a sweep of some
type
let's look at our environments and see
let's look at our environments and see
what was like what we want to
use here's here's here's the play Joseph
use here's here's here's the play Joseph
you uh you generate your heat map during
you uh you generate your heat map during
during the run and and then you you
during the run and and then you you
report it to the Neptune can't
report it to the Neptune can't
really no I don't think you can do that
really no I don't think you can do that
not really
like the uh I can do it offline very
like the uh I can do it offline very
easily because like I can just download
easily because like I can just download
the data right and I can do it offline
the data right and I can do it offline
pretty
pretty
easily maybe I'll do that to start
with well you could you could have a you
with well you could you could have a you
know you can have it grab it each time
know you can have it grab it each time
uh after a Run's complete you know it
uh after a Run's complete you know it
can it can grab it and update the the
can it can grab it and update the the
all the runs counter for all the runs
all the runs counter for all the runs

what what what you doing I'm just
what what what you doing I'm just
thinking how I want to structure stuff
thinking how I want to structure stuff
like we don't have all the new machines
like we don't have all the new machines
yet but I I want to start thinking about
yet but I I want to start thinking about
like how we're going to set up our
like how we're going to set up our
baselines for Science and how we're
baselines for Science and how we're
going to like go about
stuff that's the real engineering right
stuff that's the real engineering right
well it's like structurally how you
well it's like structurally how you
support the
support the
research yeah because like I don't want
research yeah because like I don't want
to just do breakout and
to just do breakout and
pong
obviously some of the environments kind
obviously some of the environments kind
of take a little bit too
of take a little bit too
long at the
long at the
moment like actually let me look at
moment like actually let me look at
breakout for
breakout for
instance so
instance so
like the parito front a breakout
like the parito front a breakout
here in order to get a good run you kind
here in order to get a good run you kind
of need to run it for 20 20 minutes
of need to run it for 20 20 minutes
which is nutty 20 minutes
which is nutty 20 minutes
why does it just take a long time to
why does it just take a long time to
discover oh I can get the ball above the
discover oh I can get the ball above the
blocks I mean let's look oh I can break
blocks I mean let's look oh I can break
out or is it a matter of it having to
out or is it a matter of it having to
play the second game as well so this is
play the second game as well so this is
what the curves look
like whoa
like whoa
intense
intense
um yep it's all over the place
I don't know why these
I don't know why these
are oh These Are by
steps
steps
heyer by time for for loading uh we're
heyer by time for for loading uh we're
trying
trying
to trying to engineer breakout to
to trying to engineer breakout to
be in a good Baseline state to perform
be in a good Baseline state to perform
research on it
like some of the M's are just too
like some of the M's are just too
slow like to train I guess that just
slow like to train I guess that just
means that
like it's not a terrible thing well I
like it's not a terrible thing well I
mean like look at these curves like
mean like look at these curves like
these curves are like a lot of these
these curves are like a lot of these
curves are very
curves are very
reasonable like look at this this is a
reasonable like look at this this is a
very reasonable learning
curve yeah that one looks nice and this
curve yeah that one looks nice and this
is very like they're a little spiky but
is very like they're a little spiky but
like for the most part they're very very
reasonable the endpoint estimate should
reasonable the endpoint estimate should
be very accurate as
well I guess we are not sweeping bat
well I guess we are not sweeping bat
size and stuff at all in here so we're
size and stuff at all in here so we're
kind of missing out
kind of missing out
on a lot of the potential
on a lot of the potential
speed
speed
parameters and a lot of what carbs can
do maybe that's a good thing to do
do maybe that's a good thing to do
because this is kind of a good case
because this is kind of a good case
study for that if you think about it
study for that if you think about it
right cuz right now we're like we're not
right cuz right now we're like we're not
really giving
really giving
carbs enough room to find fast
carbs enough room to find fast
stuff um cu the batch size perms are
fixed I mean all Bally the ideal sweep
fixed I mean all Bally the ideal sweep
is you have everything in there well
is you have everything in there well
yeah but
yeah but
that's it's hard to get that to
work agreed
um I mean this is the stuff I this is
um I mean this is the stuff I this is
the type of stuff I want to be thinking
the type of stuff I want to be thinking
about um I've just I've had to catch up
about um I've just I've had to catch up
on a lot of work for labs and clients
on a lot of work for labs and clients
and
and
stuff
stuff
yeah I I I got even more to do on that
yeah I I I got even more to do on that
but I know you you need an
but I know you you need an
employee yeah I mean I can onboard a lot
employee yeah I mean I can onboard a lot
of the open source folks to science side
of the open source folks to science side
stuff Spencer and Captain are both now
stuff Spencer and Captain are both now
getting to the point where they're
getting to the point where they're
qualified this is pretty I mean it's
qualified this is pretty I mean it's
pretty pretty straightforward
pretty pretty straightforward
stuff it isn't it
stuff it isn't it
isn't well puffer Li so yeah
isn't well puffer Li so yeah
running the stuff is not hard setting
running the stuff is not hard setting
the stuff up is not hard thinking about
the stuff up is not hard thinking about
what to actually run and why
what to actually run and why
is yeah that takes
is yeah that takes
yeah I I think that it would be a good
yeah I I think that it would be a good
idea to try to bring down the wall clock
idea to try to bring down the wall clock
time of
time of
breakout I think that would be a useful
breakout I think that would be a useful
thing to do as a case study to figure
thing to do as a case study to figure
out like what parameters matter there
out like what parameters matter there
and it's possible that we end up
and it's possible that we end up
actually training at like a slower step
actually training at like a slower step
per second even in order to do that yeah
per second even in order to do that yeah
we could we could also have you know
we could we could also have you know
have sweeps for optimizing different
have sweeps for optimizing different
different variables
different variables
too uh these let's look at this optimize
too uh these let's look at this optimize
score right no they optimize they
score right no they optimize they
optimize both um they it's a Paro
optimize both um they it's a Paro
front when you what your your what is
front when you what your your what is
your uh your setting uh in the
your uh your setting uh in the
config well it optimizes score but the
config well it optimizes score but the
thing is carbs takes into account time
thing is carbs takes into account time
so it will try to find like the best
so it will try to find like the best
score for each amount of time so it will
score for each amount of time so it will
push it will push for
push it will push for
faster right so I'm saying I'm
faster right so I'm saying I'm
saying you can get interesting results
saying you can get interesting results
sometimes from optimizing a different
sometimes from optimizing a different
variable ver versus versus score I don't
variable ver versus versus score I don't
know about that I I I have
know about that I I I have
well that's the variable you care
about well yeah for it's it's a little
about well yeah for it's it's a little
trickier for like breakout doesn't have
trickier for like breakout doesn't have
that many parameters
that many parameters
really yeah so yeah score
yeah but there there are there are going
yeah but there there are there are going
to be different environments that have
to be different environments that have
different things you care about like for
different things you care about like for
instance for Blaster you don't want the
instance for Blaster you don't want the
enemy to get across the
enemy to get across the
screen uh MH that means it's gone you
screen uh MH that means it's gone you
know you have to dodge at once right so
know you have to dodge at once right so
you could optimize for minimizing
that well that's just a proxy
that well that's just a proxy
reward it is well you could what you
reward it is well you could what you
should do is you should tune that reward
should do is you should tune that reward
way but you still ultimately care about
way but you still ultimately care about
your
score true but does the model respond
score true but does the model respond
to stuff ma maximization of score versus
to stuff ma maximization of score versus
there may be an easier way to like the
there may be an easier way to like the
proxy may be yeah but you still measure
proxy may be yeah but you still measure
you you measure the thing you care about
you you measure the thing you care about
you can optimize in whatever you still
you can optimize in whatever you still
measure the thing that you care
measure the thing that you care
about yeah
about yeah
true and and score should should be
true and and score should should be
going up when it works
going up when it works
well so
okay how fast is breakout
train let's find out so by default
train let's find out so by default
breakouts actually quite
breakouts actually quite
slow
slow
240k so let's
240k so let's
see if I do One update
see if I do One update
Epoch and what the mini bat side the
Epoch and what the mini bat side the
default settings for this are
default settings for this are
Oban um
Oban um
16 and then was it it
16 and then was it it
32 then let's
32 then let's
do let's see so if I do
this 400k
and then if I do up to
4096 700k it's still
not does autot tune

okay
good okay that's better so
600k and now if I do
breakout yeah yeah yeah okay breakouts
breakout yeah yeah yeah okay breakouts
at a mill now perfect so if you run 4096
at a mill now perfect so if you run 4096
M you get a

10 Bill run going overnight very good
so the somewhat obnoxious thing about

I really like the fact I really like how
I really like the fact I really like how
I have mini batch size
I have mini batch size

sweeps um batch size and mini batch size
sweeps um batch size and mini batch size
are kind of Linked In A
are kind of Linked In A
Way true so you can't you can't have
Way true so you can't you can't have
like mini bat side that is greater than
like mini bat side that is greater than
batch sizeer will stop
you well but if you do it in a sweep
you well but if you do it in a sweep
it'll just cause the thing to crash I
it'll just cause the thing to crash I
would like it to not even be sampled I
would like it to not even be sampled I
don't really like the idea of switching
don't really like the idea of switching
the mini batch size parameter to a num
the mini batch size parameter to a num
mini batches parameter
mini batches parameter
though yeah let me see what that would
though yeah let me see what that would
look like in the
code shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't carbs
code shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't carbs
be smart enough not to give it crashing
be smart enough not to give it crashing
stuff uh it'll learn eventually but it's
stuff uh it'll learn eventually but it's
still not
great oh yeah well I computed here hold
great oh yeah well I computed here hold
on I computed here anyways and then do I
on I computed here anyways and then do I
use this [ __ ] it's an assert no mini
batches you're going to compute one from
batches you're going to compute one from
the other anyways
yeah you can set it as
yeah you can set it as
failed but it's better if carbs just
failed but it's better if carbs just
can't sample invalid parameters in the
can't sample invalid parameters in the
first
place I could switch
place I could switch
it from mini batch size to num mini
it from mini batch size to num mini
batches
and then when you go to sweep
and then when you go to sweep
it then it's just a
it then it's just a
uniform uniform int from like say 1
to8 and then you get to set B
to8 and then you get to set B
size pretty well independently
it's not
bad I mean this will totally screw
bad I mean this will totally screw
random search but you just can't random
random search but you just can't random
search batch size I
guess oh why would you random search
guess oh why would you random search
patch size like is that even a
patch size like is that even a
thing it's just if you didn't if you
thing it's just if you didn't if you
were not using
carbs I'm trying to think if I want to
carbs I'm trying to think if I want to
implement this right
implement this right
now time is it

it's only
it's only
nine only nine Joseph has changed oh I
nine only nine Joseph has changed oh I
did get up at like six
something it would be good because I'd
something it would be good because I'd
be able to launch something at least
be able to launch something at least
yeah let's let's do it let's just do
yeah let's let's do it let's just do
this now we're going to do the quick
this now we're going to do the quick
version of it um I'm going to do it on
version of it um I'm going to do it on
the ablation blanch Branch so I don't
the ablation blanch Branch so I don't
miss anything
up
e e
we'll do powers of two anyways
what exactly is puffer logging
what exactly is puffer logging
bug uh you have to divide by the number
bug uh you have to divide by the number
of update Epoch and the number of mini
of update Epoch and the number of mini
batches but there's a little bit more to
batches but there's a little bit more to
it than the original bug report so I
it than the original bug report so I
haven't fixed it
haven't fixed it
yet but basically our losses are
yet but basically our losses are
probably going to be increased by a
probably going to be increased by a
factor of of update
epox there's a
epox there's a
bug a small logging bug
bug a small logging bug
yeah well does it have to do with
yeah well does it have to do with
printing
logs uh it has to do with the magnitude
logs uh it has to do with the magnitude
of logs
of logs
only okay
only okay
it's not a huge
deal okay I think this is actually
deal okay I think this is actually
enough uh let me
see e
there we
there we
go mini
batches
e e
that could
that could
oh
[ __ ] that's a big
one I
one I
can't it's kind of hard because
I can just resample to be
fair I can just
resample so I think it's still good that
resample so I think it's still good that
I did the mini batch
I did the mini batch
change um
but I yeah I still need to read that's
but I yeah I still need to read that's
fine I just have to Res
sample 2
six so then this is going to be like
six so then this is going to be like
this out
this out
to and we'll
do mini
do mini
B it's going to
B it's going to

eight be one two 4 or
eight is there anything else I want to
eight is there anything else I want to
sweep in

be
this is going to be this gonna take some
this is going to be this gonna take some
time to get
time to get

substantial change to some
stuff is uh is this Neptune

sweeping
sweeping
yes Neptune does not have a sweep
yes Neptune does not have a sweep
feature so this is just manually queuing

jobs
I want to add early stopping as
I want to add early stopping as
well yeah I was going to mention
that um update EPO
like
this is gamma supposed to be that low
this is gamma supposed to be that low
what like 0927 gamma
what like 0927 gamma
oh that's the those prems are tanked
oh that's the those prems are tanked
they'll get sweeped
they'll get sweeped
over
over
okay yeah we'll get better
okay yeah we'll get better
prems cuz it'll it'll probably be pretty
prems cuz it'll it'll probably be pretty
stupid like unless oh yeah it'll be real

something uh there's just one there's
only really one one Bad setting that you
only really one one Bad setting that you
can do which is this
can do which is this
one he's

programmatically uh programming I guess
programmatically uh programming I guess
for lack of a better term the batch many
for lack of a better term the batch many
batch and Min batch sizes so that they
batch and Min batch sizes so that they
don't screw
don't screw
up so this won't be an issue on like a
up so this won't be an issue on like a
buffer box but I know at least for me
buffer box but I know at least for me
like the way I do sweeps um and I'll you
like the way I do sweeps um and I'll you
know probably switch over to whatever
know probably switch over to whatever
like puffer has like once it's like uh
like puffer has like once it's like uh
far along but but um I run every like
far along but but um I run every like
run in a new process and that actually
run in a new process and that actually
turned out really nice because like I
turned out really nice because like I
only have a 380 ti so only like 12 gigs
only have a 380 ti so only like 12 gigs
of vram so sometimes like when I was
of vram so sometimes like when I was
before sweeping over a batch of mini
before sweeping over a batch of mini
batch sometimes you know like the sweep
batch sometimes you know like the sweep
uh with carbs would suggest combos that
uh with carbs would suggest combos that
wouldn't fit uh in like my vram so then
wouldn't fit uh in like my vram so then
it would just like give me a CA air and
it would just like give me a CA air and
then I just tell carbs like hey like
then I just tell carbs like hey like
that's a fail and then it keep going so
that's a fail and then it keep going so
yeah so literally this is all you have
yeah so literally this is all you have
to do like the batch will always fit in
to do like the batch will always fit in
your vram and if it doesn't there's an
your vram and if it doesn't there's an
offload option um literally you just
offload option um literally you just
have to check the mini batch isn't too
have to check the mini batch isn't too
big and you're good which is this lineup
big and you're good which is this lineup
wait what's the offload option there's
wait what's the offload option there's
an option to offload the entire batch of
an option to offload the entire batch of
data to the CPU so you never store your
data to the CPU so you never store your
batch your full batch on
batch your full batch on
GPU I see that probably way slows it

doesn't need to be slow super slow
doesn't need to be slow super slow

for a second shut up oh okay well I it
was still spoling up um there so I got
was still spoling up um there so I got
all these
all these

epox I mean how do how how do we do
epox I mean how do how how do we do
early stopping we'll see if this
early stopping we'll see if this
works does I don't know if the number of

M is getting
swept done
swept done
num well it's on there you just don't
num well it's on there you just don't
know if it's working I I bet you it
know if it's working I I bet you it
isn't let me
isn't let me
see break
full yeah I bet that's not working let
full yeah I bet that's not working let
me kill this real
quick okay and let me figure out
quick okay and let me figure out
cuz that's like the really
important that's kind of a very
important I want to just get this to
important I want to just get this to
running go to [ __ ] to bad oh and what
running go to [ __ ] to bad oh and what
there's a break point in here how the
there's a break point in here how the
[ __ ] is this
[ __ ] is this
not there are multiple break points in
not there are multiple break points in
various
things okay well I I don't understand
things okay well I I don't understand
where it might hit after mode oh sweep
where it might hit after mode oh sweep
okay so I'm not running sweep as why I'm
okay so I'm not running sweep as why I'm
running
running
sweep it's probably probably why you put
sweep it's probably probably why you put
the breakpoint
the breakpoint
in let's see
in let's see
this okay so
this okay so
args ARS n okay that's
args ARS n okay that's
cool and then when we
do that actually looks good to
do that actually looks good to
me right the parameters that's
me right the parameters that's
picked it looks good and then because I
picked it looks good and then because I
didn't
do yeah so let's just
do yeah so let's just
remove move
this
this
these okay now let's try
these okay now let's try
this and this should be slower

all right
oh wait
oh wait
self oh that's

obnoxious I
see that supposed to be the same numm or
what are we working on fixing uh car
what are we working on fixing uh car
sweep real quick with en

args P do
args P do
items go through
sweep okay

yeah
train and then we
do if
name so
ARS
okay let me see
this I might have gotten
it just a small name conflict bug
okay whatever we don't have policy ARS
okay whatever we don't have policy ARS
yet
anyways D
Branch good so this I think this now
Branch good so this I think this now
works
I should
have
full
good Okay cool so let's see what the
good Okay cool so let's see what the

this and whether
this and whether
this this
worked 1024

one last time so I can change a couple
one last time so I can change a couple
small
small

um I think we've
um I think we've
learned well I want to play with BF
learned well I want to play with BF
coefficient some more cuz there's some
coefficient some more cuz there's some
janky stuff going on but I don't want to
janky stuff going on but I don't want to
play with it right
now so I think what I want to do is I
now so I think what I want to do is I
want to fix VF
want to fix VF

like the max rorm parameter
like the max rorm parameter
either what does it set to in clean ARL
0.5 entropy Lambda
okay so we get rid of this and now we
okay so we get rid of this and now we
just have EP Horizon
just have EP Horizon
EPO Lambda Gamma entropy learning rate
EPO Lambda Gamma entropy learning rate
and then the scale
and then the scale
PRS I think this is
PRS I think this is
good I think that this
good I think that this
is this is an
is this is an
improvement what we do is we run this we
improvement what we do is we run this we
hope that this doesn't crash
hope that this doesn't crash
overnight and I think for
set let's
see let's see what parameters this gives
see let's see what parameters this gives
us 1024
amps and then we get train
amps and then we get train
frams
frams
of 65 okay batch size BPT Horizon
of 65 okay batch size BPT Horizon
yeah 0.5 value
yeah 0.5 value
function for many
batches Lambda Gamma learning R I think
batches Lambda Gamma learning R I think
these are
these are
reasonable so now the question is going
reasonable so now the question is going
to be of course we don't have early
to be of course we don't have early
stopping early stopping would help a
lot
lot
yeah
um I can Implement that
um I can Implement that
tomorrow early stopping would help a lot
tomorrow early stopping would help a lot
we'll do that tomorrow cuz I can specify
we'll do that tomorrow cuz I can specify
like you know if it's not if you don't
like you know if it's not if you don't
have 20 score and five minutes or
have 20 score and five minutes or
whatever kill the
run but I think that this is going to be
run but I think that this is going to be
interesting
interesting
because so here's the goal with this
because so here's the goal with this
right I did 100 runs of
right I did 100 runs of
carbs uh not messing with the scale of
carbs uh not messing with the scale of
parameters kind of just sweeping your
parameters kind of just sweeping your
standard stuff
standard stuff
right and I get this nice Paro front
right and I get this nice Paro front
here the best you do is you get like 850
here the best you do is you get like 850
score in about 800
score in about 800
seconds uh that's more than 10 minutes
seconds uh that's more than 10 minutes
right that's almost 15 minutes it's like
right that's almost 15 minutes it's like
15 minutes to get a reasonably good
15 minutes to get a reasonably good
solve on the
solve on the
environment so now the question is you
environment so now the question is you
know can we really tune this thing so
know can we really tune this thing so
that we solve breakout in like five
that we solve breakout in like five
minutes or
minutes or
something and if so what does that tell
something and if so what does that tell
us right what does that tell us going
us right what does that tell us going
forward about how we should should be
forward about how we should should be
tuning Our environments and such and
tuning Our environments and such and
generally if we can get all of our
generally if we can get all of our
environments to not only run fast but to
environments to not only run fast but to
train fast and wall clock time uh then
train fast and wall clock time uh then
that really increases our ability to run
that really increases our ability to run
more and more
more and more
experiments we can really crank up the
experiments we can really crank up the
number of experiments we can run and
number of experiments we can run and
then because I don't want to just be
then because I don't want to just be
running p and breakout right I want to
running p and breakout right I want to
be running our full Suite of
environments um but to do that we're
environments um but to do that we're
going to have to get them training
going to have to get them training
faster in wall
faster in wall
clock of course once we get the You Know
clock of course once we get the You Know
M many more machines we can kind of work
M many more machines we can kind of work
around a little bit but
around a little bit but
still we want everything to be nice and
still we want everything to be nice and
fast and for some of these it might mean
fast and for some of these it might mean
that we have to take training speed down
that we have to take training speed down
to like you know 200,000 steps per
to like you know 200,000 steps per
second um in order to get it to actually
second um in order to get it to actually
be faster wall clock and that's fine the
be faster wall clock and that's fine the
horror 200,000 steps per
horror 200,000 steps per
second we can lit we can get close to
second we can lit we can get close to
200,000 steps second without a GPU on
200,000 steps second without a GPU on
most of our environment
most of our environment
are true we can literally do that on
are true we can literally do that on
like one CPU core for most of our
environments yeah puffer's
environments yeah puffer's
fast
yep I'm pretty good at making stuff fast
yep I'm pretty good at making stuff fast
around
here okay so that's
here okay so that's
interesting so this was a quick run
interesting so this was a quick run
there's your curve let's
there's your curve let's
go it's a quick
go it's a quick
run of 100 so we got in three minutes we
run of 100 so we got in three minutes we
get 178 score and breakout on our very
get 178 score and breakout on our very

this is I just want to make sure it's
this is I just want to make sure it's
not somebody I talk to
not somebody I talk to
oh yeah so here's speaking of
oh yeah so here's speaking of
experiments here's an interesting
experiments here's an interesting
one

um
so so what's going on is apparently my
so so what's going on is apparently my
co my my Pokemon runs work better only
co my my Pokemon runs work better only
work if I have Tor shot comp pile
work if I have Tor shot comp pile
on oh that oh this this is the and
on oh that oh this this is the and
thenar mine too no like it's really
thenar mine too no like it's really
bizarre like
bizarre like
I'm not sure what I'm not sure what's
I'm not sure what I'm not sure what's
happened in this run because like
happened in this run because like
everything just a nose dive
everything just a nose dive
but I'm not sure what happened to these
but I'm not sure what happened to these
metrics just stopped cutting but
metrics just stopped cutting but
like it was really
like it was really
weird like it was like going for like
weird like it was like going for like
six times longer and just wasn't
six times longer and just wasn't
producing I'm like is what in the what
producing I'm like is what in the what
in the world is like
in the world is like
sensitive

to like the this parameter I don't know
uh it doeses seem a little weird it does
uh it doeses seem a little weird it does
seem weird but like it's i' it's cor
seem weird but like it's i' it's cor
it's like well I mean we'll see where
it's like well I mean we'll see where
this experiment ends up something's
this experiment ends up something's
weird happening right now in it
weird happening right now in it
but it's like it got like like it got

activity well let me see something else
activity well let me see something else
what does Top Cut look like yeah it got
what does Top Cut look like yeah it got
but I is it better or worse it's
but I is it better or worse it's
debatable there's like a certain level
debatable there's like a certain level
like it needs like
like it needs like
20% I guess needs like 10 like 1.5% it
20% I guess needs like 10 like 1.5% it
needs like another 5% of Pokemon that
needs like another 5% of Pokemon that
know cut before it like actually learns
know cut before it like actually learns
how to use cut
how to use cut
properly it's
properly it's
weird but yeah it's like I don't
weird but yeah it's like I don't
know working better all right we'll see
know working better all right we'll see
what happens well these runs are going
what happens well these runs are going
nicely
nicely
uh we will
uh we will
see we will see how smart carbs is we
see we will see how smart carbs is we
will see how smart carbs is are you
will see how smart carbs is are you
riding your own carbs because like

that'd be nice you still got to write
that'd be nice you still got to write
Ray tuner for

like I only I only have one workable box
like I only I only have one workable box
right now anyways so I got to fix you
right now anyways so I got to fix you
know maybe tomorrow we'll do the micro
know maybe tomorrow we'll do the micro
code update finally that'd be good it's
code update finally that'd be good it's
not just m micro code it's like you try

Neptune give me a tour of Neptune while
Neptune give me a tour of Neptune while
we're here Neptune it's really nice show
we're here Neptune it's really nice show

one right you got all your charts that's
one right you got all your charts that's
what expect they they
what expect they they
display more data and they load
display more data and they load
faster okay that's good and then you
faster okay that's good and then you
have this nice dashboard view we can
have this nice dashboard view we can
just add whatever charts and then you
just add whatever charts and then you
can just apply this dashboard to any set
can just apply this dashboard to any set
of runs that you like and what I do is I
of runs that you like and what I do is I
just group everything by Tex so here I
just group everything by Tex so here I
have this carbs run right I can just
have this carbs run right I can just
enable car in instead of sweeps you can
enable car in instead of sweeps you can
just they're just tags yeah I just tag I
just they're just tags yeah I just tag I
just tag groups of runs oh that that
just tag groups of runs oh that that
that's perfect isn't this nice look how
that's perfect isn't this nice look how
easy this is right and now I have Paro I
easy this is right and now I have Paro I
got sweet progress I got all these
got sweet progress I got all these
metrics uh and then like I can just turn
metrics uh and then like I can just turn
all these off and then I can go over to
all these off and then I can go over to
like this one here which is 100 runs
like this one here which is 100 runs
right and I get this Paro front and I
right and I get this Paro front and I
can look at these runs and I like I can
can look at these runs and I like I can
have it for different environments I can
have it for different environments I can
have it for whatever I want and
have it for whatever I want and
everything loads it's not perfect but it
everything loads it's not perfect but it
loads a fair bit faster it displays 200
loads a fair bit faster it displays 200
points by dult instead of 50 um it's
points by dult instead of 50 um it's
quite
quite
nice yeah that and then like you get you
nice yeah that and then like you get you
know your experiments here so like here
know your experiments here so like here
I can look at this one and I have all
I can look at this one and I have all
the parameters like you would expect so
the parameters like you would expect so
I can look at train
I can look at train
TR honestly you may have me sold on tags
TR honestly you may have me sold on tags
it's pretty good and I do the exact same
it's pretty good and I do the exact same
thing now for wanb so what we're going
thing now for wanb so what we're going
to do in the next update we're going to
to do in the next update we're going to
drop support for wanb sweeps but we're
drop support for wanb sweeps but we're
going to keep support for wanb because I
going to keep support for wanb because I
do the exact same thing in wanb with
do the exact same thing in wanb with
tags the UI is just not quite as nice it
tags the UI is just not quite as nice it
lags a little more and you don't get the
lags a little more and you don't get the
nice data download features that's one
nice data download features that's one
of the really nice selling points is you
of the really nice selling points is you
can just I can just download this entire
can just I can just download this entire
group as a data frame and like 10
group as a data frame and like 10
seconds wait how do you do tags and wa

weights and biases they have a tags they
weights and biases they have a tags they
have a tags thing same as here they just
have a tags thing same as here they just
don't have like this nice dashboards
don't have like this nice dashboards
View and stuff that's really easy to
View and stuff that's really easy to
apply to tags it's a little laggier and
apply to tags it's a little laggier and
stuff I mean Neptune has fewer features

talking about like 100 gigabytes of
talking about like 100 gigabytes of
storage and no uh the main thing that
storage and no uh the main thing that
doesn't exist in W is the data download
doesn't exist in W is the data download
that's their biggest
that's their biggest
one no no no no sorry you said Neptune
one no no no no sorry you said Neptune
has fewer features than oh yeah Neptune

the ones that's missing in Neptune is
the ones that's missing in Neptune is
like this is all they have for charts
like this is all they have for charts
they really don't have very many options
they really don't have very many options
they don't have like I can't add custom
they don't have like I can't add custom
charts here like I would like to be able

to add custom charts and stuff so it's
pretty
pretty
limited let me see custom charts like
limited let me see custom charts like
what are you looking for well one thing
what are you looking for well one thing
I really want which I'm going to get on
I really want which I'm going to get on
a call with them and see if I can get
a call with them and see if I can get
them to do this uh you should be able to
them to do this uh you should be able to
apply a a color palette to your points
apply a a color palette to your points
because what I would like to do is I'd
because what I would like to do is I'd
like to do hot cold based on creation
like to do hot cold based on creation

not do tables no you do I think you do
not do tables no you do I think you do
hold on tabl I mean I monitor they have

but uh no no the question is can you
but uh no no the question is can you
upload a table Yeah It's gotta it's gota
upload a table Yeah It's gotta it's gota
look so like for Pokemon I you can add a
look so like for Pokemon I you can add a
CSV it's an artifact yes that's f they
CSV it's an artifact yes that's f they
visualize the CSV well so Pokemon I
visualize the CSV well so Pokemon I
upload all the parties of every agent
upload all the parties of every agent
every like you know periodically I think
every like you know periodically I think
you just and you can just add that as a

Pam CU like they group nice into folders
Pam CU like they group nice into folders
and you just do like this is a table
and you just do like this is a table
it's not a it's not a parameter though
it's not a it's not a parameter though
parameters are constant for the entire

run usually you can overwrite
run usually you can overwrite
them the but I it just is a chart it's
them the but I it just is a chart it's
basically just is a chart and you get
basically just is a chart and you get
the latest value here ah so it's not in
the latest value here ah so it's not in
the right place I it's not I mean it's

not
perfect I think I think we said before I
perfect I think I think we said before I
think we said before about CSV uploads

would make way more sense this is kind
would make way more sense this is kind
of cool they do monitoring here uh
of cool they do monitoring here uh
what's the source code so they do your
what's the source code so they do your
source
source
code does that automatically Yeah well
code does that automatically Yeah well
yeah I look see we have our
yeah I look see we have our
score see this run and I go back to

WB bug no they didn't fix it he's like
WB bug no they didn't fix it he's like
yeah I'll get on it yeah I'll they never
yeah I'll get on it yeah I'll they never
fix anything no he he actually bies the
fix anything no he he actually bies the
big issue W and biases is they've been
big issue W and biases is they've been
constantly changing their you like
constantly changing their you like
breaking their U every
breaking their U every
Friday they keep on sometimes fixing it
Friday they keep on sometimes fixing it
but not
but not
often these guys are this is I've been
often these guys are this is I've been
happy I'll support both as the thing I
happy I'll support both as the thing I
just won't support w b sweeps I'll just
just won't support w b sweeps I'll just
support uh sweep tags I did this for NYU
support uh sweep tags I did this for NYU
I did this for NYU yesterday a few days
I did this for NYU yesterday a few days
ago in want here I'll show you exactly
ago in want here I'll show you exactly
what it looks like I would support want
what it looks like I would support want
I would support weights and bias sweeps
I would support weights and bias sweeps
I actually would support weights and
I actually would support weights and
biases sweeps if they didn't force you
biases sweeps if they didn't force you
into only two algorithms and then made
into only two algorithms and then made
it so you could just bring in whatever
it so you could just bring in whatever
you want and they and you could like do
you want and they and you could like do
your own yeah but you can do you can do
your own yeah but you can do you can do
that just like with like with tags and
that just like with like with tags and
it's easier yeah you can you don't want
it's easier yeah you can you don't want
like their API doesn't add
like their API doesn't add
anything no but that that that's the
anything no but that that that's the
it's like you just want the convenience
it's like you just want the convenience
of like oh let me bring in my own Loop
of like oh let me bring in my own Loop
you just manage the server and that's
you just manage the server and that's
that it's just convenient if they have
that it's just convenient if they have
it yeah but they don't it's not good any
it yeah but they don't it's not good any
like yeah your server well no I got I
like yeah your server well no I got I
mean I I got it to work I did it that's
mean I I got it to work I did it that's
not good I made the loop oh great I mean
not good I made the loop oh great I mean
the other issue is I have to like sync
the other issue is I have to like sync
all the code across all the servers
all the code across all the servers
whenever runs that's the reason why I
whenever runs that's the reason why I
was going with Ray is because like with
was going with Ray is because like with
Ray I can just like say Boop oh take all
Ray I can just like say Boop oh take all
my code where' the thing go the task
my code where' the thing go the task
okay so here
okay so here
is here I set this one up for NYU like
is here I set this one up for NYU like
you see they have they have all these
you see they have they have all these
runs and then they have all these
runs and then they have all these
metrics right and they can add stuff to
metrics right and they can add stuff to
these
these
um but like it's the same thing in WB
um but like it's the same thing in WB
it's just not as clean weird curve yeah
it's just not as clean weird curve yeah

it's in Python okay thank God so we do
we do deploy our tell you you have to
we do deploy our tell you you have to
write your own CA curl we do we actually
write your own CA curl we do we actually
do run our networks and see uh for the
do run our networks and see uh for the
site but we don't have Cuda kernels from
site but we don't have Cuda kernels from
let me show you it's very simple so all
let me show you it's very simple so all
I have is there's this puffet Doh file
I have is there's this puffet Doh file
which is like a 500 line file all right
which is like a 500 line file all right
and this implements lstms coms uh linear
and this implements lstms coms uh linear
layers activations all the stuff and it
layers activations all the stuff and it
implements it exactly like torch does so
implements it exactly like torch does so
if you look at most of these things most
if you look at most of these things most
of our environments use standard
of our environments use standard
architectures uh some of them don't but
architectures uh some of them don't but
like here if I look at if I open pong. C
like here if I look at if I open pong. C
all right this has got a linear lstm
all right this has got a linear lstm
which is a linear layer followed by an
which is a linear layer followed by an
lstm that's the policy just make this
lstm that's the policy just make this
with from puffet and then you just call
with from puffet and then you just call
this on the
this on the
observations and because it's all in C
observations and because it's all in C
the result of that is I can open up the
the result of that is I can open up the
website and I can click on pong and this
website and I can click on pong and this
is a neuronet playing pong in your
is a neuronet playing pong in your
browser because it's just running the
browser because it's just running the
weights and
weights and
see but we train in P George oh okay if
see but we train in P George oh okay if
you have a fancy Network you know if you
you have a fancy Network you know if you
have a really fancy Network like I had
have a really fancy Network like I had
to do for neural mo3 yeah there's a
to do for neural mo3 yeah there's a
little bit more work involved like this
little bit more work involved like this
is the MMO net right there's like a
is the MMO net right there's like a
little bit of stuff it's not that bad
little bit of stuff it's not that bad
though and like here this is the whole
though and like here this is the whole
network that's it that's the forward
network that's it that's the forward
pass for like a pretty damn fancy
Network and then the result of this is
Network and then the result of this is
neural mo3 policy runs in your browser
so it's not that
bad all right gotta I have
bad all right gotta I have
to I did the hard part already the hard
to I did the hard part already the hard
part was getting uh was getting the
part was getting uh was getting the
implementations of the layers to exactly
implementations of the layers to exactly
match P torch that was a pain in the ass
match P torch that was a pain in the ass
but uh you know I wrote some tests and
but uh you know I wrote some tests and
it took some time and I did
it took some time and I did
it did you stop streaming on on X no if
it did you stop streaming on on X no if
I stopped it's because it crashed
I stopped it's because it crashed
you're back I think yeah you're
you're back I think yeah you're
back I know I think I should go to bed
back I know I think I should go to bed
anyways it's like 10 something

six people watching me why do I have
six people watching me why do I have
nine people at least just like watching
nine people at least just like watching
me hang out and about RL I mean one of
me hang out and about RL I mean one of

some other people so for folks that are
some other people so for folks that are
there um I mean all this RL stuff it's
there um I mean all this RL stuff it's
free it's open source you can check
free it's open source you can check
puffer doai for demos join the Discord
puffer doai for demos join the Discord
right here this is where we're all
right here this is where we're all
hanging out as you can see this is kind
hanging out as you can see this is kind
of a routine thing um I'm also I post
of a routine thing um I'm also I post
all the stuff on X and if you want to
all the stuff on X and if you want to
help us out for free star the repository
help us out for free star the repository
really helps us out
really helps us out
uh if you're looking to get into RL the
uh if you're looking to get into RL the
best way to do that is to just swing by
best way to do that is to just swing by
and start coding up a new environment
and start coding up a new environment
and get RL working on it end to end we
and get RL working on it end to end we
have like brand new people with no RL
have like brand new people with no RL
experience coming and do this it's uh
experience coming and do this it's uh
and we just need to be able to Cod
and we just need to be able to Cod
that's about it I think that's going to
that's about it I think that's going to
be it though for tonight I'm pretty
be it though for tonight I'm pretty
tired folks
tired folks
um I me take care of yourself yeah I'm
um I me take care of yourself yeah I'm
pretty tired so I think I'm going to go
pretty tired so I think I'm going to go
to sleep and then tomorrow when I get up
to sleep and then tomorrow when I get up
I'm going to do
I'm going to do
we're going to look at these hyper pram
we're going to look at these hyper pram
sweeps a little bit more uh I'm probably
sweeps a little bit more uh I'm probably
going to start looking at some
going to start looking at some
curriculum SL exploration stuff on
curriculum SL exploration stuff on
stream we'll probably look at a couple
stream we'll probably look at a couple
papers of that and fix a few puffer bugs
papers of that and fix a few puffer bugs
maybe work on a couple of our academic
maybe work on a couple of our academic
collabs we'll see I really do want to
collabs we'll see I really do want to
spin up the science side of puffer Moore
spin up the science side of puffer Moore
though so Spencer's not around and
though so Spencer's not around and
Captain's not around but I'm going to be
Captain's not around but I'm going to be
onboarding them hopefully to that
onboarding them hopefully to that
um and I think that the next steps are
um and I think that the next steps are
going to be to get get more of the
going to be to get get more of the
Baseline environments training faster in
Baseline environments training faster in
wall clock time just via like hyper pram
wall clock time just via like hyper pram
sweep stuff and then using that fast
sweep stuff and then using that fast
Baseline start modifying algorithmic
Baseline start modifying algorithmic
things and then rerunning full sweep so
things and then rerunning full sweep so
like we will launch 100 experiments per
like we will launch 100 experiments per
environment and then we'll launch like
environment and then we'll launch like
10 environments so a thousand
10 environments so a thousand
experiments per algorithmic change and
experiments per algorithmic change and
if we can get all of those to run in
if we can get all of those to run in
like single digit number of GPU
like single digit number of GPU
days I think even get that to run in
days I think even get that to run in
like three GPU days maybe and then we'll
like three GPU days maybe and then we'll
be in a good
be in a good
spot that's the
plan
plan
yes agree yeah

Kind: captions
Language: en
is the X streaming thing fixed oh
look okay so they do all have to go into
look okay so they do all have to go into
one scene perfect thank you
one scene perfect thank you
Alexi
um yeah yeah cool X streaming is back
um yeah yeah cool X streaming is back
working great it was broken
working great it was broken
before happy 720 on a
before happy 720 on a
Thursday we are whoops don't need to
that we got code review to do for bet
that we got code review to do for bet
whenever he's back and in the
whenever he's back and in the
meantime we can look at some experiments
meantime we can look at some experiments
let's do
let's do
that oh there he
that oh there he
is
is
cool that is
cool that is
here I will take a quick look at
here I will take a quick look at
experiments in the meantime
never made it to exercise
never made it to exercise
ridiculous man you got to do your
ridiculous man you got to do your
exercise not
optional okay so
optional okay so
here we got our carbs red um
I'm trying to think what graph I can
log I basically want to see if carbs is
log I basically want to see if carbs is
getting better over time during the
getting better over time during the
sweep and it's a little tricky because
sweep and it's a little tricky because
like some of these points let me see
like some of these points let me see
make sure this is showing yeah okay so
make sure this is showing yeah okay so
some of
yeah so some of these
yeah so some of these
points right on sweet progress uh they
points right on sweet progress uh they
might be over here or something which is
might be over here or something which is
on the Paro
on the Paro
Frontier I'm trying to think how to see
Frontier I'm trying to think how to see
this
um what metric should I log
it's not going to be linear so I can't
it's not going to be linear so I can't
do
like the plots are only 2D
like the plots are only 2D
right I think 3D is a stupid thing to do
right I think 3D is a stupid thing to do
but yeah it's only 2D
anyways oh
I'm trying to think
it's kind of late let me just let's just
it's kind of late let me just let's just
make sure I'm not being
make sure I'm not being
stupid I doubt I am being stupid but
stupid I doubt I am being stupid but
let's see if there's an obvious answer
let's see if there's an obvious answer
I'm
missing
e e
yeah that doesn't freaking help
okay so I'm not being stupid this is
okay so I'm not being stupid this is
just there's no obvious answer to this
um
H actually you know what would work is
H actually you know what would work is
the
the
coloration is there a way to color the
coloration is there a way to color the
points
if you could just color the points to be
um you know hot to cold or something
um you know hot to cold or something
then you'd see over
time so you get scatter
time so you get scatter
chart hey bet
chart hey bet
okay so this is a chart that I can make
okay so this is a chart that I can make
but not a chart that I can make in
but not a chart that I can make in
Neptune I
think let me test now let's do your code
think let me test now let's do your code
review thing right um You can do that
review thing right um You can do that
another time I think that it's I think
another time I think that it's I think
it's correct anyways
okay
okay
good let's get your code reviewed so you
good let's get your code reviewed so you
changed a bunch of stuff on
changed a bunch of stuff on
Duro and you fix some things in Blaster
right like to get Blaster just added
right like to get Blaster just added
that'd be a nice thing to
do yes did you change Blaster yet or
no can we get yeah
sure BL that's
sure BL that's
fine let me figure out how to do this
uh okay I have desktop
audio let see if this
audio let see if this
works hey
works hey
bet yo yo I think that this setup should
bet yo yo I think that this setup should
work um
cool lots and lots of cool lots of
cool lots and lots of cool lots of
progress this week lots and lots of
progress this week lots and lots of
progress this week
progress this week
um yeah been
um yeah been
busy yeah yeah I'm super busy too I
busy yeah yeah I'm super busy too I
don't know if I made a lot of progress
don't know if I made a lot of progress
but uh Blaster will be refactored
but uh Blaster will be refactored
shortly fix this let me just check to
shortly fix this let me just check to
make sure I
haven't we got quotes for the new
haven't we got quotes for the new
machines we got

be it in on uh yeah let me know if the
be it in on uh yeah let me know if the
audio works there and if it does then
audio works there and if it does then
you're going to want to mute it because
you're going to want to mute it because
you hear the Discord audio oh yeah I've
you hear the Discord audio oh yeah I've
already got
already got
muted hopefully it's not echoing and
muted hopefully it's not echoing and
[ __ ] but yep I sound great we sound

cool okay
cool okay
and okay so somehow
this is
this is
down 6 700 lines okay actually that's
down 6 700 lines okay actually that's
kind of about what I expected so it's

want to put it back we I added this to
want to put it back we I added this to

all environments see reset cstep and C
render uh so I actually I figured out
render uh so I actually I figured out
the source of that it's not a problem
the source of that it's not a problem
with our with the code at all it's an

utterly stupid problem with cond C
utterly stupid problem with cond C
compiler which like a bunch of people

use uh there's no way that I can see

around it so I changed it in all
around it so I changed it in all
environments even though it's a really

stupid fix so cond cond C compiler yep
stupid fix so cond cond C compiler yep
it's horribly broken code and by the way
it's horribly broken code and by the way
even if you compile even once you get it
even if you compile even once you get it
working the compile like 3x lower than

underscore to everything just the step

render and reset functions are
render and reset functions are

uh he was the one that discovered the

but um you got to be careful because I
but um you got to be careful because I
don't know what compiler it is that's
don't know what compiler it is that's
breaking but it seems that it's way
breaking but it seems that it's way
slower as well uh and I I messed with
slower as well uh and I I messed with
the flags a whole bunch it was also
the flags a whole bunch it was also
injecting a bunch of garbage compile
injecting a bunch of garbage compile
Flags but I couldn't reproduce like I
Flags but I couldn't reproduce like I
could not get it to be fast even with

uh let's
see game
state so you got rid of some stuff let's

I wish this freaking window worked cuz

good so let's see what you remember
good so let's see what you remember
moved here
um you still have all these

X so you somehow removed a bunch of

renderer they do not live somewhere else
they're they're in endur now right yeah
they're they're in endur now right yeah
well they were in endur all and they
well they were in endur all and they
were getting copied over okay yeah yeah
were getting copied over okay yeah yeah
so you sto doing the weird like
so you sto doing the weird like
functional copy [ __ ] good I stopped
functional copy [ __ ] good I stopped
doing the weird functional copy [ __ ]
doing the weird functional copy [ __ ]
yeah okay you do not need to duplicate
yeah okay you do not need to duplicate
variables in multiple places that's just
variables in multiple places that's just
eror pron and stupid okay that's good
eror pron and stupid okay that's good
that's a good fix um and then but
that's a good fix um and then but
they're also fewer variables in here
they're also fewer variables in here
now yeah there's I'm curious as to how
now yeah there's I'm curious as to how
you got rid of
you got rid of
these uh let me see
here like some of these are constants
here like some of these are constants
like car with and car height yeah any
like car with and car height yeah any
anything constant is now a constant so
anything constant is now a constant so
that's up top now yep or car car width
that's up top now yep or car car width
and car height weren even weren't even
and car height weren even weren't even
being used I don't think I might have
being used I don't think I might have
made those removed a bunch of dumb [ __ ]
made those removed a bunch of dumb [ __ ]
that like was like from
that like was like from
yeah okay and then this like gear
yeah okay and then this like gear
threshold okay yeah these are constants
threshold okay yeah these are constants
okay I told you this so you pulled all
okay I told you this so you pulled all
the constants out to constants and
the constants out to constants and
removed all the random [ __ ] that you
removed all the random [ __ ] that you
didn't actually need yes
didn't actually need yes
correct
okay sure you can have an enem I don't
okay sure you can have an enem I don't
ever see the point of having enems but
ever see the point of having enems but
you can have one
you can have one
sure thanks
sure thanks
and
and
then the [ __ ] is all
then the [ __ ] is all
this it's a it's an asset map you want
this it's a it's an asset map you want
me to put in a different file I can do
me to put in a different file I can do
that no that doesn't need to go in a
that no that doesn't need to go in a
different
file because they're all on a Sprite
file because they're all on a Sprite
sheet and these are the dimensions they
sheet and these are the dimensions they
are all on a Sprite sheet and those are
are all on a Sprite sheet and those are
di that's fine yep that's totally
fine how do you know what the index is
fine how do you know what the index is
to
to
use H how do you know what the index
use H how do you know what the index
is how but just making this spreadsheet
is how but just making this spreadsheet
and
and
then okay well we'll look at that I use
then okay well we'll look at that I use
a I use a spreadsheet uh Creator and I
a I use a spreadsheet uh Creator and I
very
very
painstakingly uh place I mean when you
painstakingly uh place I mean when you
access when you access
access when you access
them okay this is um before I was
them okay this is um before I was
mapping it to an Eno I just mapped it
mapping it to an Eno I just mapped it
directly you said this is this is better
directly you said this is this is better
the reason that this is better is
the reason that this is better is
because the reason this is better is
because the reason this is better is
because you had stupid [ __ ] like asset
because you had stupid [ __ ] like asset
digit 0 through n where this is really
digit 0 through n where this is really
like it's going to be like digits and
like it's going to be like digits and
then plus like an offset or something so
then plus like an offset or something so
having like enums for this is insane um
having like enums for this is insane um
so yeah I don't
so yeah I don't
know I'm curious how you're mapping it
know I'm curious how you're mapping it
when you have literally one of these
when you have literally one of these
sheets like I would think that this
sheets like I would think that this
would be like rectangle background map
would be like rectangle background map
and then that has 15 16 things and like
and then that has 15 16 things and like
Mountains map has 16 things or whatever
Mountains map has 16 things or whatever
so it's easier to index but we'll see
so it's easier to index but we'll see
how you're
how you're
indexing
indexing
yeah so I probably would have made this
yeah so I probably would have made this
like what is this four or five separate
like what is this four or five separate
Maps but if you have a good way of
Maps but if you have a good way of
indexing it's
indexing it's
fine uh client where' the client go
fine uh client where' the client go
all the prototypes are gone good they
all the prototypes are gone good they
you don't need prototypes all the
you don't need prototypes all the
prototypes are gone correct good yeah
prototypes are gone correct good yeah
you should not need
prototypes especially not for like a
prototypes especially not for like a

single file game

car get furthest Lane are these new
car get furthest Lane are these new
functions uh no those are not new okay
functions uh no those are not new okay
so you just moved them around a bit
so you just moved them around a bit
okay uh I don't know why the log but
okay uh I don't know why the log but
buffers way the hell down here but
buffers way the hell down here but
whatever Aggregate and
clear and you did uh you did my new

login style good yep that's fine that
saves you some lines
saves you some lines
good now in nit well where did nit go
good now in nit well where did nit go
and it's under free
allocators so keep keep going
allocators so keep keep going
it'll be down okay so you just moved it
it'll be down okay so you just moved it
line 425 and now you have this net
line 425 and now you have this net
function which sets a billion variables
function which sets a billion variables
but I'm hoping that I'm not going to see
but I'm hoping that I'm not going to see
the same code twice because I saw it
the same code twice because I saw it
twice before you're not going to see
twice before you're not going to see
you're not going to see any duplications
you're not going to see any duplications
at all there are no so there's a bunch
at all there are no so there's a bunch
of obnoxious initialization here it is
of obnoxious initialization here it is
all necessary like it won't train if one
all necessary like it won't train if one
of them not initialize properly like
of them not initialize properly like
which is interesting because C zero all
which is interesting because C zero all
the things that are zeros but whatever I
the things that are zeros but whatever I
guess you use this to reset as well
guess you use this to reset as well
don't
don't
you uh yes I am dual purposing it that's
you uh yes I am dual purposing it that's
okay so that's use it to zero that's
okay so that's use it to zero that's
fine but where where where where would I
fine but where where where where would I
be celing everything it would probably
be celing everything it would probably
go in I mean it would probably if what I
go in I mean it would probably if what I
would do is I would probably stick most
would do is I would probably stick most
of this into reset instead of in in it
of this into reset instead of in in it
because it's like you're calling in it
because it's like you're calling in it
from reset which is kind of weird it
from reset which is kind of weird it
would be better to just put the stuff
would be better to just put the stuff
that you need to in it once here and
that you need to in it once here and
then the stuff that needs to be called
then the stuff that needs to be called
every time goes in reset um that would
every time goes in reset um that would
probably be a bit better but at least
probably be a bit better but at least
you're no longer calling everything
you're no longer calling everything
twice CU I think before you had yeah you
twice CU I think before you had yeah you
had everything in reset as well which
had everything in reset as well which
was obscene so this is at least
was obscene so this is at least
substantially
better quadratic yeah okay this stuff
better quadratic yeah okay this stuff
rodex i' I've already reviewed your code
rodex i' I've already reviewed your code
so I'm just looking for like major
so I'm just looking for like major
refactor
refactor
changes um
changes um
y yeah so I would still probably stick
y yeah so I would still probably stick
like the if you want to keep messing
like the if you want to keep messing
with stuff I would probably move all the
with stuff I would probably move all the
stuff that needs to be done on reset
stuff that needs to be done on reset
into here um and here's the thing it all
into here um and here's the thing it all
needs to be done basically on reset uh
needs to be done basically on reset uh
like all of this stuff is well yeah but
like all of this stuff is well yeah but
I it's weird to have reset call a knit
I it's weird to have reset call a knit
like you're supposed to call a knit once
like you're supposed to call a knit once
and then you call reset whenever you
and then you call reset whenever you
need to reset so like if it all needs to
need to reset so like if it all needs to
be done on reset that just means that
be done on reset that just means that
like you don't really have an inip
like you don't really have an inip
function just have a reset function um
function just have a reset function um
yeah so I guess it could be all moved to
yeah so I guess it could be all moved to
uh but I imagine some of this is going
uh but I imagine some of this is going
to be like some of these are constants
to be like some of these are constants
right well to be fair probably you could

take out the the ones that are constants

what you did all right so you went and
what you did all right so you went and
constructed all these
constructed all these

offsets because you made one texture
array right correct okay look now you're

stupid it's better than before but it's

you're getting very direct code review
you're getting very direct code review
at this hour it's fine say whatever I've

offended I'm not good at coding okay so
offended I'm not good at coding okay so
look this [ __ ] right here all right this
look this [ __ ] right here all right this
is asset like this is asset mapcore BG
is asset like this is asset mapcore BG
all right and this [ __ ] right here is

and this [ __ ] right here is asset map
and this [ __ ] right here is asset map
digits right and this is green digits
digits right and this is green digits
and this is yellow digits and then you
and this is yellow digits and then you
don't have to compute any offsets at all
don't have to compute any offsets at all
because it's just going to be you know
because it's just going to be you know
background of index it will be 0 to 16
background of index it will be 0 to 16
right mountains 0 to 16 digits 0 to n or

exact same
performance well hold on isn't this
performance well hold on isn't this
slightly more
slightly more
compact no it's not this is flat ma
compact no it's not this is flat ma
because because then you have all this
because because then you have all this
[ __ ] indexing logic at the bottom to
[ __ ] indexing logic at the bottom to
compute the
offsets so when you have like blocks of
offsets so when you have like blocks of
16 indices like that there's no reason
16 indices like that there's no reason
to flat map it like
that you can have like four or five
that you can have like four or five
different
different
Maps it's not more compact because you
Maps it's not more compact because you
have to do all this indexing
have to do all this indexing
Shenanigans like you wouldn't even here
Shenanigans like you wouldn't even here
let me find it for you
all right not only is it more
all right not only is it more
confusing but like where is it where's
confusing but like where is it where's
the stupid
thing okay so not only is this confusing
thing okay so not only is this confusing
as all hell but you don't even need
as all hell but you don't even need
these variables like these variables
these variables like these variables
would not be part of game State they
would not be part of game State they
would not
would not
exist because you wouldn't need the
exist because you wouldn't need the
indices because it's like if you just
indices because it's like if you just
wanted digit three it would just be
wanted digit three it would just be
three you wouldn't have to worry about
three you wouldn't have to worry about
these offsets so all this [ __ ] like
these offsets so all this [ __ ] like
right here like most of this code just
right here like most of this code just
gets
deleted rip there you go so that's this
deleted rip there you go so that's this
is how like if you think about your data
is how like if you think about your data
structures a little bit you end up with
structures a little bit you end up with
less garbage to have to do housekeeping
less garbage to have to do housekeeping
over okay clean up fine make make client
over okay clean up fine make make client
fine close why is there close client and
fine close why is there close client and
a
up don't don't make useless
up don't don't make useless
functions this is all just close client
functions this is all just close client
this there's no reason you would ever
this there's no reason you would ever
call this other than when you close the
client okay under
car this yeah that's
fine update car animation
scoreboard yeah like look all this this
scoreboard yeah like look all this this
like digit next you wouldn't need any of
like digit next you wouldn't need any of
the
[ __ ] under
background I'm the
scoreboard yeah so all this asset map
scoreboard yeah so all this asset map
stuff would be a lot easier cuz this
stuff would be a lot easier cuz this
current asset index X you wouldn't have
current asset index X you wouldn't have
this it would just be like score digit
this it would just be like score digit
minus one or
whatever they
whatever they
completed let's yeah so all this
completed let's yeah so all this
indexing stuff that's going to confuse
indexing stuff that's going to confuse
you would be like this would all be
you would be like this would all be
cleaned
up Victory update mountains
up Victory update mountains
cool
cool
mountains car index
good enemy car get Road color under
Road asset car index car asset index so
Road asset car index car asset index so
we had to compute get car texture index
we had to compute get car texture index
you had to do a whole bunch of stuff for
you had to do a whole bunch of stuff for
this color
okay and
then yeah it's kind of fine to have a
then yeah it's kind of fine to have a
function that looks like this this is
fine yeah that's the render clean
fine yeah that's the render clean
no that's fine
I mean it depends how long the function
I mean it depends how long the function
is
is
right it would be very long
yeah if this were like a 300 line
yeah if this were like a 300 line
function I would just make it a function
function I would just make it a function
with sections I would agree it's not 300
with sections I would agree it's not 300
lines well the question is could it be
lines well the question is could it be
lines I don't know no we'll see how much
lines I don't know no we'll see how much
shorter kits when we remove a bunch of
shorter kits when we remove a bunch of
indexing or [ __ ] but uh it'll be a
indexing or [ __ ] but uh it'll be a
little it'll be a little shorter but
little it'll be a little shorter but
probably not a ton shorter a lot of that
probably not a ton shorter a lot of that
a lot of that is the uh the
a lot of that is the uh the
score but you see how like you know your
score but you see how like you know your
brain can only handle so much code at a
brain can only handle so much code at a
time so if you write more code than you
time so if you write more code than you
need you don't not only do you have to
need you don't not only do you have to
deal with that code but then you have to
deal with that code but then you have to
add more structure to break it apart
add more structure to break it apart
because your brain can't handle that
because your brain can't handle that
much code so you end up with even more
much code so you end up with even more
garbage code so this is why like
garbage code so this is why like
programming skill is exponential because
programming skill is exponential because
like if you do stuff in the simplest and
like if you do stuff in the simplest and
the easiest way possible not only do you
the easiest way possible not only do you
avoid
avoid
the redundancy but you avoid the
the redundancy but you avoid the
structure to support the
structure to support the
redundancy yeah this is a this is a good
redundancy yeah this is a this is a good
Improvement uh I will say this is a good
Improvement uh I will say this is a good
Improvement I'm being very harsh uh not
Improvement I'm being very harsh uh not
really not not really what I would say
really not not really what I would say
is so what I want you to do is first of
is so what I want you to do is first of
all take your stupid auto form matter
all take your stupid auto form matter
and rerun it back to four spaces commit
and rerun it back to four spaces commit
that and then the next time you show me
that and then the next time you show me
a diff give me the diff from that
a diff give me the diff from that
version so that it doesn't destroy
version so that it doesn't destroy
everything again gotcha okay I've
everything again gotcha okay I've
already already done that so yeah so
already already done that so yeah so
make sure you do that and
make sure you do that and
then uh if you depending on how much
then uh if you depending on how much
more you want to keep refactoring so I
more you want to keep refactoring so I
don't know refactoring your code is a
don't know refactoring your code is a
really damn way good way to learn how to
really damn way good way to learn how to
get better at stuff so I personally
get better at stuff so I personally
would suggest that you keep doing little
would suggest that you keep doing little
bits here and there on the side if you
bits here and there on the side if you
get bored you know by all means do other
get bored you know by all means do other
projects but you know keep coming back
projects but you know keep coming back
to it here and there um because it's a
to it here and there um because it's a
really really good way to improve is
really really good way to improve is
just like polishing your code until it
just like polishing your code until it
no longer hurts your eyes
um yeah the indexing the most egregious
um yeah the indexing the most egregious
thing the most egregious thing I saw was
thing the most egregious thing I saw was
the way you're doing indexing that's the
the way you're doing indexing that's the
worst data structure that you
have as for like is there other
have as for like is there other
redundant logic I don't know I literally
redundant logic I don't know I literally
don't know I would have to like see the
don't know I would have to like see the
code put together after you know you
code put together after you know you
make these changes and fix the spacing
make these changes and fix the spacing
and everything else and then I would
and everything else and then I would
have to look through the like not the
have to look through the like not the
diff I'd have to look through the whole
diff I'd have to look through the whole
source file and see if I see anything
source file and see if I see anything
else to simplify right yeah because how
else to simplify right yeah because how
even even I can't tell [ __ ] from like
even even I can't tell [ __ ] from like
looking at just these diffs I guess
looking at just these diffs I guess
technically look technically I could do
technically look technically I could do
where is
where is
it technically I could do
it technically I could do
this and just see the
this and just see the
latest file okay so now we're down to
latest file okay so now we're down to
lines yeah get rid of this [ __ ] this
lines yeah get rid of this [ __ ] this
ridiculous um
constants are
fine I generally like don't put all the
fine I generally like don't put all the
strs together I see you put all the strs
strs together I see you put all the strs
together I generally put the methods
together I generally put the methods
that go with the strs with the strs so
that go with the strs with the strs so
like I put my logging with my logging um
like I put my logging with my logging um
yeah I saw that it's just like it's kind
yeah I saw that it's just like it's kind
of annoying otherwise
um got car
yeah so these indices are just going to
yeah so these indices are just going to
be gone right all these indices are just
be gone right all these indices are just
like
gone
gone
yeah I even this like even
yeah I even this like even
this like you don't need indices for
this like you don't need indices for
this index index yeah
this index index yeah
but be locally defined locally defined
but be locally defined locally defined
variable though right what yeah it'll
variable though right what yeah it'll
just need to be locally defined or you
just need to be locally defined or you
don't need the freaking indices at all
don't need the freaking indices at all
because look these These are only there
because look these These are only there
because you have offsets into a giant
because you have offsets into a giant
texture map like you don't need to it
texture map like you don't need to it
backround because this is just going to
backround because this is just going to
be 0 through 16 0 16 0 through 11 0
be 0 through 16 0 16 0 through 11 0
through 10 or 0 through n like they
through 10 or 0 through n like they
won't even have to
won't even have to
exist I yeah I I understand it okay so
exist I yeah I I understand it okay so
like a lot of the stuff in this game
like a lot of the stuff in this game
State I don't know what these offsets
State I don't know what these offsets
are
are
I guess this is a height offset so this
I guess this is a height offset so this
is
legit H yeah the um the the drawing of
legit H yeah the um the the drawing of
that is super complicated yeah I can buy
that is super complicated yeah I can buy
this is a
this is a
pain okay and then you have really bad
pain okay and then you have really bad
all this [ __ ] okay this is a big ass
all this [ __ ] okay this is a big ass
struck um yeah it's all the end logic
yeah I I don't I don't understand how
yeah I I don't I don't understand how
this is a like like in the format I
this is a like like in the format I
don't understand how this is like oh
don't understand how this is like oh
this is the way that the format should
this is the way that the format should
be it clearly looks like crap it's very
be it clearly looks like crap it's very
confusing to look at well you learned
confusing to look at well you learned
something don't use those I think these
something don't use those I think these
are constants
are constants
I'm pretty
I'm pretty
sure um they might be and this one gear
sure um they might be and this one gear
Gear speed threshold sounds very
Gear speed threshold sounds very
constant to me this sounds constant to
me so I mean this is a big struck there
me so I mean this is a big struck there
are a few things that can get out of it
are a few things that can get out of it
but yeah it's a big environment it's
but yeah it's a big environment it's
going to be a big struck whatever
um I don't really I don't really like
um I don't really I don't really like
the idea of like breaking apart a struck
the idea of like breaking apart a struck
just for the sake of breaking it apart
just for the sake of breaking it apart
if you're only going to use it once so I
if you're only going to use it once so I
think this is fine it's fine to have a
think this is fine it's fine to have a
big struct as long as all the stuff in
big struct as long as all the stuff in
the struct actually needed right like
the struct actually needed right like
I'm is this OB siiz of isn't this a
I'm is this OB siiz of isn't this a
constant as well isn't this defined up
constant as well isn't this defined up
top
top
um possibly I think there are like five
um possibly I think there are like five
or six variables here at least that
or six variables here at least that
don't need to be here um
OB size is definitely
OB size is definitely
constant I feel I feel like the top as
constant I feel I feel like the top as
well I feel like I removed it there was
well I feel like I removed it there was
an issue or something oh you can see I
an issue or something oh you can see I
put like all the constants at the top
put like all the constants at the top
now the exception here is if you're
now the exception here is if you're
going to put like the rayb rendering
going to put like the rayb rendering
stuff down with the rendering that's
stuff down with the rendering that's
fine I usually do that but I'd put like
fine I usually do that but I'd put like
all the actual constants up at the top
all the actual constants up at the top
enum is fine here I'd probably just
enum is fine here I'd probably just
pound a fine but en is
pound a fine but en is
fine this is now going to be like five
fine this is now going to be like five
or six different asset
or six different asset
Maps yes and you're GNA you'll actually
Maps yes and you're GNA you'll actually
save lines because you won't have all
save lines because you won't have all
the index in garbage I will refactor
the index in garbage I will refactor
that first we will we will see logs yeah
that first we will we will see logs yeah
i' put this back up with the logs right
i' put this back up with the logs right
and add log I put my Logs with logs
and add log I put my Logs with logs
breaks it
breaks it
up okay and then this allocate free in
up okay and then this allocate free in
it is good most of the init stuff would
it is good most of the init stuff would
probably go and
probably go and
reset
yeah yeah gotcha this a constant
yeah yeah gotcha this a constant
totally
um gear time over total
um gear time over total
time Min hold on
so so what I'm pretty sure this is I'm
so so what I'm pretty sure this is I'm
pretty sure that this is a very fancy
pretty sure that this is a very fancy
way of calculating a constant it is I'm
way of calculating a constant it is I'm
I'm almost certain like I'm pretty sure
I'm almost certain like I'm pretty sure
you could just calculate what this is
you could just calculate what this is
and then write as a constant because
and then write as a constant because
yeah yeah just looking at just looking
yeah yeah just looking at just looking
at it again now that you've yeah like
at it again now that you've yeah like
all this stuff pointed it out I did uh
all this stuff pointed it out I did uh
you know I basically what I just used
you know I basically what I just used
the litness test to see what was a class
the litness test to see what was a class
and what wasn't like is uh is the
and what wasn't like is uh is the
variable being changed at all if it's
variable being changed at all if it's
not then it doesn't need to be a
not then it doesn't need to be a
variable so and initialize that's
fine you have in both Pathways here you
fine you have in both Pathways here you
have
zeros you take all the shared variables
zeros you take all the shared variables
that are going to be zero either way and
that are going to be zero either way and
you put them outside the statement and
you put them outside the statement and
then you delete them from the
then you delete them from the
statements they're like small things
statements they're like small things
like this all over the
place this has got to be a
constant the previous daytime
constant the previous daytime
index total day duration there's no way
index total day duration there's no way
this is a constant
this is a constant
right well what's SEC so I think you're
right well what's SEC so I think you're
Computing some constants that that is
Computing some constants that that is
being that's just a placeholder variable
being that's just a placeholder variable
for computing a
for computing a
thing but I think that the thing is a
thing but I think that the thing is a
constant whatever the name's the name's
constant whatever the name's the name's
confusing so that's why you're so reset
confusing so that's why you're so reset
I think reset gets pretty big and in it
I think reset gets pretty big and in it
gets very
gets very
small most
likely yes we can I can I can switch it
likely yes we can I can I can switch it
to you the um and then reset doesn't
to you the um and then reset doesn't
call a net uh the the only the
call a net uh the the only the
only difference here is let's see an it
only difference here is let's see an it
is getting a

reset is not so for the reset
reset is not so for the reset

it should uh use a random seed for the

for the most part if you just name your

see oh hold on rough
and well it says number of environments
and well it says number of environments
it doesn't
it doesn't

different robots but it's I don't see
different robots but it's I don't see
4,000 robots here uh true it's possible
4,000 robots here uh true it's possible
that the rendering is not but is it
that the rendering is not but is it
4,000 different environments is it four
4,000 different environments is it four
is it one environment with 4,000
is it one environment with 4,000
robots I know I know what you're asking
robots I know I know what you're asking
and I do I want to
and I do I want to
get we need like this is what we need we
get we need like this is what we need we
need this like 90k FPS the scene that we
need this like 90k FPS the scene that we
we fiddled with today only got it it's
we fiddled with today only got it it's
like 11,000 SPS is
like 11,000 SPS is
terrible oh what are these the are these
terrible oh what are these the are these
numbers with just like your just basic
numbers with just like your just basic
outline and then not doing anything or
outline and then not doing anything or
are they well I'm running puffer but the
are they well I'm running puffer but the
thing is the m is taking up 95% of the

freaking know
freaking know
now this is just the time for the

we're running training but our training
we're running training but our training

right anyways I got something working at
right anyways I got something working at
the very
the very
least twitch folks
least twitch folks
um so okay the next thing I guess I
um so okay the next thing I guess I
wanted to look
wanted to look
at so I've been sitting on this for a
at so I've been sitting on this for a
couple days and I want to run some new
couple days and I want to run some new
experiments but I've got
experiments but I've got
it's annoying to me that you can't set
it's annoying to me that you can't set
this inside
this inside
of inside of
of inside of
Neptune I wish you could just set
Neptune I wish you could just set
the you should be able to set the dot
colors uh like how are you
colors uh like how are you
gonna arrange the dots or what what's I
gonna arrange the dots or what what's I
should be able to map them
should be able to map them
to uh to like a heat map like the hot to
to uh to like a heat map like the hot to
cold or whatever yes so what I would to
cold or whatever yes so what I would to
do is I would like to have along the
do is I would like to have along the
time I'd like to use the creation time
time I'd like to use the creation time
to do hot to
to do hot to
cold and then what would that would
cold and then what would that would
happen is I would be able to
happen is I would be able to
see on this Paro graph when the runs
see on this Paro graph when the runs
were made so if it starts off hot and
were made so if it starts off hot and
then gets colder right but if I see all
then gets colder right but if I see all
the blue the blue dots are on the parito
the blue the blue dots are on the parito
front then it's getting better over time
front then it's getting better over time
right yeah so what you'd like to see is
right yeah so what you'd like to see is
all the blue dots here and all the warm
all the blue dots here and all the warm
dots over here true but I can't [ __ ]
dots over here true but I can't [ __ ]
do that because they don't let you color
do that because they don't let you color
the plot so I'm trying to see if I want
the plot so I'm trying to see if I want
to do like more offline analysis I guess
to do like more offline analysis I guess
I mean the alternative thing is they did
I mean the alternative thing is they did

things seem to be easy to add but uh
things seem to be easy to add but uh
maybe I should maybe I should set up a

deceptively difficult because they're

their code sucks and it's like hard but

I'd hope it's not that
I'd hope it's not that
hard I think that's a pretty damn good

cuz I would love to not have to do all

my analysis offline like it would be
my analysis offline like it would be
nice to just have that
nice to just have that
here I would agree with that um yeah

that'd be really good for hyper pram
that'd be really good for hyper pram
sweeps um okay so I will tell them I
sweeps um okay so I will tell them I
will talk to them about that Al so why
will talk to them about that Al so why
do I only have 57 runs
do I only have 57 runs
here
here
um what the heck is on what's what with
this there we
this there we
go
go
so yeah here are runs I mean I can see
so yeah here are runs I mean I can see
that we have a lot of good runs here at
that we have a lot of good runs here at
the least this is better than our random
the least this is better than our random
search so this is our random where's it
search so this is our random where's it
random
random
search I have lots of experiments but
search I have lots of experiments but
like most of them are bad
I think we're well set up to
I think we're well set up to
do additional stuff from here though
do additional stuff from here though
um I would like to start a sweep of some
um I would like to start a sweep of some
type
let's look at our environments and see
let's look at our environments and see
what was like what we want to
use here's here's here's the play Joseph
use here's here's here's the play Joseph
you uh you generate your heat map during
you uh you generate your heat map during
during the run and and then you you
during the run and and then you you
report it to the Neptune can't
report it to the Neptune can't
really no I don't think you can do that
really no I don't think you can do that
not really
like the uh I can do it offline very
like the uh I can do it offline very
easily because like I can just download
easily because like I can just download
the data right and I can do it offline
the data right and I can do it offline
pretty
pretty
easily maybe I'll do that to start
with well you could you could have a you
with well you could you could have a you
know you can have it grab it each time
know you can have it grab it each time
uh after a Run's complete you know it
uh after a Run's complete you know it
can it can grab it and update the the
can it can grab it and update the the
all the runs counter for all the runs
all the runs counter for all the runs
image
what what what you doing I'm just
what what what you doing I'm just
thinking how I want to structure stuff
thinking how I want to structure stuff
like we don't have all the new machines
like we don't have all the new machines
yet but I I want to start thinking about
yet but I I want to start thinking about
like how we're going to set up our
like how we're going to set up our
baselines for Science and how we're
baselines for Science and how we're
going to like go about
stuff that's the real engineering right
stuff that's the real engineering right
well it's like structurally how you
well it's like structurally how you
support the
support the
research yeah because like I don't want
research yeah because like I don't want
to just do breakout and
to just do breakout and
pong
obviously some of the environments kind
obviously some of the environments kind
of take a little bit too
of take a little bit too
long at the
long at the
moment like actually let me look at
moment like actually let me look at
breakout for
breakout for
instance so
instance so
like the parito front a breakout
like the parito front a breakout
here in order to get a good run you kind
here in order to get a good run you kind
of need to run it for 20 20 minutes
of need to run it for 20 20 minutes
which is nutty 20 minutes
which is nutty 20 minutes
why does it just take a long time to
why does it just take a long time to
discover oh I can get the ball above the
discover oh I can get the ball above the
blocks I mean let's look oh I can break
blocks I mean let's look oh I can break
out or is it a matter of it having to
out or is it a matter of it having to
play the second game as well so this is
play the second game as well so this is
what the curves look
like whoa
like whoa
intense
intense
um yep it's all over the place
I don't know why these
I don't know why these
are oh These Are by
steps
steps
heyer by time for for loading uh we're
heyer by time for for loading uh we're
trying
trying
to trying to engineer breakout to
to trying to engineer breakout to
be in a good Baseline state to perform
be in a good Baseline state to perform
research on it
like some of the M's are just too
like some of the M's are just too
slow like to train I guess that just
slow like to train I guess that just
means that
like it's not a terrible thing well I
like it's not a terrible thing well I
mean like look at these curves like
mean like look at these curves like
these curves are like a lot of these
these curves are like a lot of these
curves are very
curves are very
reasonable like look at this this is a
reasonable like look at this this is a
very reasonable learning
curve yeah that one looks nice and this
curve yeah that one looks nice and this
is very like they're a little spiky but
is very like they're a little spiky but
like for the most part they're very very
reasonable the endpoint estimate should
reasonable the endpoint estimate should
be very accurate as
well I guess we are not sweeping bat
well I guess we are not sweeping bat
size and stuff at all in here so we're
size and stuff at all in here so we're
kind of missing out
kind of missing out
on a lot of the potential
on a lot of the potential
speed
speed
parameters and a lot of what carbs can
do maybe that's a good thing to do
do maybe that's a good thing to do
because this is kind of a good case
because this is kind of a good case
study for that if you think about it
study for that if you think about it
right cuz right now we're like we're not
right cuz right now we're like we're not
really giving
really giving
carbs enough room to find fast
carbs enough room to find fast
stuff um cu the batch size perms are
fixed I mean all Bally the ideal sweep
fixed I mean all Bally the ideal sweep
is you have everything in there well
is you have everything in there well
yeah but
yeah but
that's it's hard to get that to
work agreed
um I mean this is the stuff I this is
um I mean this is the stuff I this is
the type of stuff I want to be thinking
the type of stuff I want to be thinking
about um I've just I've had to catch up
about um I've just I've had to catch up
on a lot of work for labs and clients
on a lot of work for labs and clients
and
and
stuff
stuff
yeah I I I got even more to do on that
yeah I I I got even more to do on that
but I know you you need an
but I know you you need an
employee yeah I mean I can onboard a lot
employee yeah I mean I can onboard a lot
of the open source folks to science side
of the open source folks to science side
stuff Spencer and Captain are both now
stuff Spencer and Captain are both now
getting to the point where they're
getting to the point where they're
qualified this is pretty I mean it's
qualified this is pretty I mean it's
pretty pretty straightforward
pretty pretty straightforward
stuff it isn't it
stuff it isn't it
isn't well puffer Li so yeah
isn't well puffer Li so yeah
running the stuff is not hard setting
running the stuff is not hard setting
the stuff up is not hard thinking about
the stuff up is not hard thinking about
what to actually run and why
what to actually run and why
is yeah that takes
is yeah that takes
yeah I I think that it would be a good
yeah I I think that it would be a good
idea to try to bring down the wall clock
idea to try to bring down the wall clock
time of
time of
breakout I think that would be a useful
breakout I think that would be a useful
thing to do as a case study to figure
thing to do as a case study to figure
out like what parameters matter there
out like what parameters matter there
and it's possible that we end up
and it's possible that we end up
actually training at like a slower step
actually training at like a slower step
per second even in order to do that yeah
per second even in order to do that yeah
we could we could also have you know
we could we could also have you know
have sweeps for optimizing different
have sweeps for optimizing different
different variables
different variables
too uh these let's look at this optimize
too uh these let's look at this optimize
score right no they optimize they
score right no they optimize they
optimize both um they it's a Paro
optimize both um they it's a Paro
front when you what your your what is
front when you what your your what is
your uh your setting uh in the
your uh your setting uh in the
config well it optimizes score but the
config well it optimizes score but the
thing is carbs takes into account time
thing is carbs takes into account time
so it will try to find like the best
so it will try to find like the best
score for each amount of time so it will
score for each amount of time so it will
push it will push for
push it will push for
faster right so I'm saying I'm
faster right so I'm saying I'm
saying you can get interesting results
saying you can get interesting results
sometimes from optimizing a different
sometimes from optimizing a different
variable ver versus versus score I don't
variable ver versus versus score I don't
know about that I I I have
know about that I I I have
well that's the variable you care
about well yeah for it's it's a little
about well yeah for it's it's a little
trickier for like breakout doesn't have
trickier for like breakout doesn't have
that many parameters
that many parameters
really yeah so yeah score
yeah but there there are there are going
yeah but there there are there are going
to be different environments that have
to be different environments that have
different things you care about like for
different things you care about like for
instance for Blaster you don't want the
instance for Blaster you don't want the
enemy to get across the
enemy to get across the
screen uh MH that means it's gone you
screen uh MH that means it's gone you
know you have to dodge at once right so
know you have to dodge at once right so
you could optimize for minimizing
that well that's just a proxy
that well that's just a proxy
reward it is well you could what you
reward it is well you could what you
should do is you should tune that reward
should do is you should tune that reward
way but you still ultimately care about
way but you still ultimately care about
your
score true but does the model respond
score true but does the model respond
to stuff ma maximization of score versus
to stuff ma maximization of score versus
there may be an easier way to like the
there may be an easier way to like the
proxy may be yeah but you still measure
proxy may be yeah but you still measure
you you measure the thing you care about
you you measure the thing you care about
you can optimize in whatever you still
you can optimize in whatever you still
measure the thing that you care
measure the thing that you care
about yeah
about yeah
true and and score should should be
true and and score should should be
going up when it works
going up when it works
well so
okay how fast is breakout
train let's find out so by default
train let's find out so by default
breakouts actually quite
breakouts actually quite
slow
slow
240k so let's
240k so let's
see if I do One update
see if I do One update
Epoch and what the mini bat side the
Epoch and what the mini bat side the
default settings for this are
default settings for this are
Oban um
Oban um
16 and then was it it
16 and then was it it
32 then let's
32 then let's
do let's see so if I do
this 400k
and then if I do up to
4096 700k it's still
not does autot tune
not does autot tune
work hold on PA only has 1024 hold on
why is pong
why is pong
slow there defaults just suck or is
slow there defaults just suck or is
there something running in the backround

on what the [ __ ] is

running maybe someone's run or something
running maybe someone's run or something
that's your that's your personal one
that's your that's your personal one
though
right okay this is stuck in the

somehow
uh what is
uh what is
pill slf I just do
this
[ __ ] suspiciously pill slf
[ __ ] suspiciously pill slf
python uh Dash F Jesus
okay
good okay that's better so
600k and now if I do
breakout yeah yeah yeah okay breakouts
breakout yeah yeah yeah okay breakouts
at a mill now perfect so if you run 4096
at a mill now perfect so if you run 4096
M you get a
mill which is what you would expect um
mill which is what you would expect um
10 Bill run going overnight very good
so the somewhat obnoxious thing about
so the somewhat obnoxious thing about
this
I really like the fact I really like how
I really like the fact I really like how
I have mini batch size
I have mini batch size
specified
specified
where you have to explicitly put it
where you have to explicitly put it
because it prevents you from shooting
because it prevents you from shooting
yourself in the foot in various ways but
yourself in the foot in various ways but
the thing is when it comes to hyper
the thing is when it comes to hyper
parameter
parameter
sweeps um batch size and mini batch size
sweeps um batch size and mini batch size
are kind of Linked In A
are kind of Linked In A
Way true so you can't you can't have
Way true so you can't you can't have
like mini bat side that is greater than
like mini bat side that is greater than
batch sizeer will stop
you well but if you do it in a sweep
you well but if you do it in a sweep
it'll just cause the thing to crash I
it'll just cause the thing to crash I
would like it to not even be sampled I
would like it to not even be sampled I
don't really like the idea of switching
don't really like the idea of switching
the mini batch size parameter to a num
the mini batch size parameter to a num
mini batches parameter
mini batches parameter
though yeah let me see what that would
though yeah let me see what that would
look like in the
code shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't carbs
code shouldn't shouldn't shouldn't carbs
be smart enough not to give it crashing
be smart enough not to give it crashing
stuff uh it'll learn eventually but it's
stuff uh it'll learn eventually but it's
still not
great oh yeah well I computed here hold
great oh yeah well I computed here hold
on I computed here anyways and then do I
on I computed here anyways and then do I
use this [ __ ] it's an assert no mini
batches you're going to compute one from
batches you're going to compute one from
the other anyways
yeah you can set it as
yeah you can set it as
failed but it's better if carbs just
failed but it's better if carbs just
can't sample invalid parameters in the
can't sample invalid parameters in the
first
place I could switch
place I could switch
it from mini batch size to num mini
it from mini batch size to num mini
batches
and then when you go to sweep
and then when you go to sweep
it then it's just a
it then it's just a
uniform uniform int from like say 1
to8 and then you get to set B
to8 and then you get to set B
size pretty well independently
it's not
bad I mean this will totally screw
bad I mean this will totally screw
random search but you just can't random
random search but you just can't random
search batch size I
guess oh why would you random search
guess oh why would you random search
patch size like is that even a
patch size like is that even a
thing it's just if you didn't if you
thing it's just if you didn't if you
were not using
carbs I'm trying to think if I want to
carbs I'm trying to think if I want to
implement this right
implement this right
now time is it
now time is it
it's only
it's only
nine only nine Joseph has changed oh I
nine only nine Joseph has changed oh I
did get up at like six
something it would be good because I'd
something it would be good because I'd
be able to launch something at least
be able to launch something at least
yeah let's let's do it let's just do
yeah let's let's do it let's just do
this now we're going to do the quick
this now we're going to do the quick
version of it um I'm going to do it on
version of it um I'm going to do it on
the ablation blanch Branch so I don't
the ablation blanch Branch so I don't
miss anything
up
e e
we'll do powers of two anyways
what exactly is puffer logging
what exactly is puffer logging
bug uh you have to divide by the number
bug uh you have to divide by the number
of update Epoch and the number of mini
of update Epoch and the number of mini
batches but there's a little bit more to
batches but there's a little bit more to
it than the original bug report so I
it than the original bug report so I
haven't fixed it
haven't fixed it
yet but basically our losses are
yet but basically our losses are
probably going to be increased by a
probably going to be increased by a
factor of of update
epox there's a
epox there's a
bug a small logging bug
bug a small logging bug
yeah well does it have to do with
yeah well does it have to do with
printing
logs uh it has to do with the magnitude
logs uh it has to do with the magnitude
of logs
of logs
only okay
only okay
it's not a huge
deal okay I think this is actually
deal okay I think this is actually
enough uh let me
see e
there we
there we
go mini
batches
e e
that could
that could
oh
[ __ ] that's a big
one I
one I
can't it's kind of hard because
I can just resample to be
fair I can just
resample so I think it's still good that
resample so I think it's still good that
I did the mini batch
I did the mini batch
change um
but I yeah I still need to read that's
but I yeah I still need to read that's
fine I just have to Res
sample 2
six so then this is going to be like
six so then this is going to be like
this out
this out
to and we'll
do mini
do mini
B it's going to
B it's going to
be
be
two one
eight be one two 4 or
eight is there anything else I want to
eight is there anything else I want to
sweep in
sweep in
here num
M's you sweep. m
do e
be
this is going to be this gonna take some
this is going to be this gonna take some
time to get
time to get
right yeah sweep so not this is a pretty
right yeah sweep so not this is a pretty
substantial change to some

well yeah I was going to mention
that um update EPO

this is gamma supposed to be that low
this is gamma supposed to be that low
what like 0927 gamma
what like 0927 gamma
oh that's the those prems are tanked
oh that's the those prems are tanked
they'll get sweeped
they'll get sweeped

you're not using carbs right now so
never mind I am using carbs he is using

tell carbs a okay cool just making sure
tell carbs a okay cool just making sure
so I kind of missed it before like is

there a reason or maybe this is what
there a reason or maybe this is what
you're doing right now are you kind of
you're doing right now are you kind of
writing some logic to PreCheck that the
writing some logic to PreCheck that the
hyper pram sweeps are like I don't know
hyper pram sweeps are like I don't know
valid and then like if not like telling

carbs it's a fail or

only really one one Bad setting that you
only really one one Bad setting that you

programmatically uh programming I guess
for lack of a better term the batch many
for lack of a better term the batch many
batch and Min batch sizes so that they
batch and Min batch sizes so that they
don't screw
don't screw
up so this won't be an issue on like a

buffer box but I know at least for me
buffer box but I know at least for me
like the way I do sweeps um and I'll you
like the way I do sweeps um and I'll you
know probably switch over to whatever

like puffer has like once it's like uh
like puffer has like once it's like uh
far along but but um I run every like
far along but but um I run every like
run in a new process and that actually
run in a new process and that actually
turned out really nice because like I
turned out really nice because like I
only have a 380 ti so only like 12 gigs
only have a 380 ti so only like 12 gigs

uh with carbs would suggest combos that
uh with carbs would suggest combos that
wouldn't fit uh in like my vram so then
wouldn't fit uh in like my vram so then
it would just like give me a CA air and
it would just like give me a CA air and
then I just tell carbs like hey like
then I just tell carbs like hey like
that's a fail and then it keep going so
that's a fail and then it keep going so
yeah so literally this is all you have
yeah so literally this is all you have
to do like the batch will always fit in
to do like the batch will always fit in
your vram and if it doesn't there's an
your vram and if it doesn't there's an

have to check the mini batch isn't too
have to check the mini batch isn't too

wait what's the offload option there's
wait what's the offload option there's
an option to offload the entire batch of

me kill this real

important that's kind of a very

running go to [ __ ] to bad oh and what
running go to [ __ ] to bad oh and what
there's a break point in here how the
there's a break point in here how the

not there are multiple break points in
not there are multiple break points in
various
things okay well I I don't understand

where it might hit after mode oh sweep
where it might hit after mode oh sweep
okay so I'm not running sweep as why I'm

running
sweep it's probably probably why you put

the breakpoint
in let's see
in let's see
this okay so
this okay so
args ARS n okay that's

cool and then when we
do that actually looks good to
do that actually looks good to
me right the parameters that's
me right the parameters that's
picked it looks good and then because I
picked it looks good and then because I
didn't

okay whatever we don't have policy ARS
okay whatever we don't have policy ARS
yet
anyways D
Branch good so this I think this now
Branch good so this I think this now
works
I should

um I think we've

coefficient some more cuz there's some

janky stuff going on but I don't want to

either what does it set to in clean ARL
0.5 entropy Lambda
okay so we get rid of this and now we
okay so we get rid of this and now we
just have EP Horizon
just have EP Horizon
EPO Lambda Gamma entropy learning rate
EPO Lambda Gamma entropy learning rate
and then the scale
and then the scale
PRS I think this is
PRS I think this is
good I think that this
good I think that this
is this is an

improvement what we do is we run this we
improvement what we do is we run this we
hope that this doesn't crash
hope that this doesn't crash
overnight and I think for
set let's
see let's see what parameters this gives
see let's see what parameters this gives
us 1024
amps and then we get train
amps and then we get train
frams
frams
of 65 okay batch size BPT Horizon
of 65 okay batch size BPT Horizon
yeah 0.5 value
yeah 0.5 value
function for many
batches Lambda Gamma learning R I think
batches Lambda Gamma learning R I think
these are
these are
reasonable so now the question is going
reasonable so now the question is going
to be of course we don't have early
to be of course we don't have early
stopping early stopping would help a
lot
lot
yeah
um I can Implement that
um I can Implement that
tomorrow early stopping would help a lot
tomorrow early stopping would help a lot
we'll do that tomorrow cuz I can specify
we'll do that tomorrow cuz I can specify
like you know if it's not if you don't
like you know if it's not if you don't
have 20 score and five minutes or
have 20 score and five minutes or
whatever kill the
run but I think that this is going to be
run but I think that this is going to be
interesting
interesting
because so here's the goal with this
because so here's the goal with this
right I did 100 runs of
right I did 100 runs of
carbs uh not messing with the scale of
carbs uh not messing with the scale of
parameters kind of just sweeping your
parameters kind of just sweeping your
standard stuff
standard stuff
right and I get this nice Paro front
right and I get this nice Paro front
here the best you do is you get like 850
here the best you do is you get like 850
score in about 800
score in about 800
seconds uh that's more than 10 minutes
seconds uh that's more than 10 minutes
right that's almost 15 minutes it's like
right that's almost 15 minutes it's like
15 minutes to get a reasonably good
15 minutes to get a reasonably good
solve on the
solve on the
environment so now the question is you
environment so now the question is you
know can we really tune this thing so
know can we really tune this thing so
that we solve breakout in like five
that we solve breakout in like five
minutes or
minutes or
something and if so what does that tell
something and if so what does that tell
us right what does that tell us going
us right what does that tell us going
forward about how we should should be
forward about how we should should be
tuning Our environments and such and
tuning Our environments and such and
generally if we can get all of our
generally if we can get all of our
environments to not only run fast but to
environments to not only run fast but to
train fast and wall clock time uh then
train fast and wall clock time uh then
that really increases our ability to run
that really increases our ability to run
more and more
more and more
experiments we can really crank up the
experiments we can really crank up the
number of experiments we can run and
number of experiments we can run and
then because I don't want to just be
then because I don't want to just be
running p and breakout right I want to
running p and breakout right I want to
be running our full Suite of
environments um but to do that we're
environments um but to do that we're
going to have to get them training
going to have to get them training
faster in wall
faster in wall
clock of course once we get the You Know
clock of course once we get the You Know
M many more machines we can kind of work
M many more machines we can kind of work
around a little bit but
around a little bit but
still we want everything to be nice and
still we want everything to be nice and
fast and for some of these it might mean
fast and for some of these it might mean
that we have to take training speed down
that we have to take training speed down
to like you know 200,000 steps per
to like you know 200,000 steps per
second um in order to get it to actually
second um in order to get it to actually
be faster wall clock and that's fine the
be faster wall clock and that's fine the
horror 200,000 steps per

person uh it's very easy to SL look at
person uh it's very easy to SL look at
the look at the the stats basically look
the look at the the stats basically look
at his numbers and you don't have to see

I lit I went in with 105 fever so yeah
I lit I went in with 105 fever so yeah
that yeah that's um yeah that's pretty
that yeah that's um yeah that's pretty
consistent with your with your infection
consistent with your with your infection
interestingly uh I saw someone else on X
interestingly uh I saw someone else on X
also said she had a the same infection
also said she had a the same infection
as well and she said it was really yes
as well and she said it was really yes
really yeah I wonder if who was it uh
really yeah I wonder if who was it uh
let me find her she said it was four
let me find her she said it was four
four uh four weeks and it was uh
four uh four weeks and it was uh
incredibly awful uh pneumonia again with

but I is it better or worse it's
but I is it better or worse it's
debatable there's like a certain level

like it needs like
like it needs like
20% I guess needs like 10 like 1.5% it
20% I guess needs like 10 like 1.5% it
needs like another 5% of Pokemon that
needs like another 5% of Pokemon that
know cut before it like actually learns

what expect they they
what expect they they
display more data and they load
display more data and they load
faster okay that's good and then you
faster okay that's good and then you
have this nice dashboard view we can
have this nice dashboard view we can
just add whatever charts and then you
just add whatever charts and then you
can just apply this dashboard to any set
can just apply this dashboard to any set
of runs that you like and what I do is I

all these off and then I can go over to
all these off and then I can go over to
like this one here which is 100 runs
like this one here which is 100 runs
right and I get this Paro front and I

it's pretty good and I do the exact same
it's pretty good and I do the exact same
thing now for wanb so what we're going
thing now for wanb so what we're going
to do in the next update we're going to
to do in the next update we're going to
drop support for wanb sweeps but we're
drop support for wanb sweeps but we're
going to keep support for wanb because I
going to keep support for wanb because I
do the exact same thing in wanb with

pretty
pretty
limited let me see custom charts like
limited let me see custom charts like
what are you looking for well one thing
what are you looking for well one thing
I really want which I'm going to get on
I really want which I'm going to get on
a call with them and see if I can get
a call with them and see if I can get
them to do this uh you should be able to
them to do this uh you should be able to
apply a a color palette to your points
apply a a color palette to your points
because what I would like to do is I'd
because what I would like to do is I'd
like to do hot cold based on creation
like to do hot cold based on creation

do tables look you upload do upload
do tables look you upload do upload
image oh tables are a big one do can you
image oh tables are a big one do can you
not do tables no you do I think you do
not do tables no you do I think you do
hold on tabl I mean I monitor they have
hold on tabl I mean I monitor they have
artifacts as well look well everyone has
artifacts as well look well everyone has
artifacts another big question how's it
artifacts another big question how's it
look Via
look Via
Mobile I don't know you know it's better
Mobile I don't know you know it's better
than it's got to be it has to be better
than it's got to be it has to be better
than not a table probably still awful
than not a table probably still awful
but uh no no the question is can you
but uh no no the question is can you
upload a table Yeah It's gotta it's gota
upload a table Yeah It's gotta it's gota
look so like for Pokemon I you can add a
look so like for Pokemon I you can add a
CSV it's an artifact yes that's f they
CSV it's an artifact yes that's f they
visualize the CSV well so Pokemon I
visualize the CSV well so Pokemon I
upload all the parties of every agent
upload all the parties of every agent
every like you know periodically I think
every like you know periodically I think
you just and you can just add that as a
you just and you can just add that as a
can't you just add that like here as
can't you just add that like here as
like a
like a
Pam CU like they group nice into folders
Pam CU like they group nice into folders
and you just do like this is a table
and you just do like this is a table
it's not a it's not a parameter though
it's not a it's not a parameter though
parameters are constant for the entire
parameters are constant for the entire
run usually you can overwrite
run usually you can overwrite
them the but I it just is a chart it's
them the but I it just is a chart it's
basically just is a chart and you get
basically just is a chart and you get
the latest value here ah so it's not in
the latest value here ah so it's not in
the right place I it's not I mean it's
the right place I it's not I mean it's
not
not
perfect I think I think we said before I
perfect I think I think we said before I
think we said before about CSV uploads
think we said before about CSV uploads
would make way more sense this is kind
would make way more sense this is kind
of cool they do monitoring here uh
of cool they do monitoring here uh
what's the source code so they do your
what's the source code so they do your
source
source
code does that automatically Yeah well
code does that automatically Yeah well
yeah I look see we have our
yeah I look see we have our
score see this run and I go back to

big issue W and biases is they've been
big issue W and biases is they've been
constantly changing their you like
constantly changing their you like
breaking their U every
breaking their U every
Friday they keep on sometimes fixing it
Friday they keep on sometimes fixing it
but not
but not
often these guys are this is I've been
often these guys are this is I've been
happy I'll support both as the thing I
happy I'll support both as the thing I
just won't support w b sweeps I'll just
just won't support w b sweeps I'll just
support uh sweep tags I did this for NYU
support uh sweep tags I did this for NYU
I did this for NYU yesterday a few days
I did this for NYU yesterday a few days
ago in want here I'll show you exactly
ago in want here I'll show you exactly
what it looks like I would support want
what it looks like I would support want
I would support weights and bias sweeps
I would support weights and bias sweeps
I actually would support weights and
I actually would support weights and
biases sweeps if they didn't force you
biases sweeps if they didn't force you
into only two algorithms and then made
into only two algorithms and then made
it so you could just bring in whatever
it so you could just bring in whatever
you want and they and you could like do
you want and they and you could like do
your own yeah but you can do you can do
your own yeah but you can do you can do
that just like with like with tags and
that just like with like with tags and
it's easier yeah you can you don't want
it's easier yeah you can you don't want
like their API doesn't add
like their API doesn't add
anything no but that that that's the
anything no but that that that's the
it's like you just want the convenience
it's like you just want the convenience
of like oh let me bring in my own Loop
of like oh let me bring in my own Loop
you just manage the server and that's
you just manage the server and that's
that it's just convenient if they have
that it's just convenient if they have
it yeah but they don't it's not good any
it yeah but they don't it's not good any
like yeah your server well no I got I
like yeah your server well no I got I
mean I I got it to work I did it that's
mean I I got it to work I did it that's
not good I made the loop oh great I mean
not good I made the loop oh great I mean
the other issue is I have to like sync
the other issue is I have to like sync
all the code across all the servers

okay so here
okay so here
is here I set this one up for NYU like
is here I set this one up for NYU like
you see they have they have all these
you see they have they have all these
runs and then they have all these
runs and then they have all these
metrics right and they can add stuff to

it's way
it's way
simpler okay yeah what I was going to
simpler okay yeah what I was going to
ask was like the um I haven't had time
ask was like the um I haven't had time
to go about like the actual like you
to go about like the actual like you
know learning part of things are we
know learning part of things are we
writing Cuda kernels no or it's in py
writing Cuda kernels no or it's in py
it's in Python okay thank God so we do
it's in Python okay thank God so we do
we do deploy our tell you you have to
we do deploy our tell you you have to
write your own CA curl we do we actually
write your own CA curl we do we actually
do run our networks and see uh for the
do run our networks and see uh for the
site but we don't have Cuda kernels from
site but we don't have Cuda kernels from
let me show you it's very simple so all
let me show you it's very simple so all
I have is there's this puffet Doh file
I have is there's this puffet Doh file
which is like a 500 line file all right
which is like a 500 line file all right
and this implements lstms coms uh linear
and this implements lstms coms uh linear
layers activations all the stuff and it
layers activations all the stuff and it
implements it exactly like torch does so
implements it exactly like torch does so
if you look at most of these things most
if you look at most of these things most
of our environments use standard
of our environments use standard
architectures uh some of them don't but
architectures uh some of them don't but
like here if I look at if I open pong. C
like here if I look at if I open pong. C
all right this has got a linear lstm
all right this has got a linear lstm
which is a linear layer followed by an
which is a linear layer followed by an
lstm that's the policy just make this
lstm that's the policy just make this
with from puffet and then you just call
with from puffet and then you just call
this on the
this on the
observations and because it's all in C
observations and because it's all in C
the result of that is I can open up the
the result of that is I can open up the
website and I can click on pong and this
website and I can click on pong and this
is a neuronet playing pong in your
is a neuronet playing pong in your
browser because it's just running the
browser because it's just running the
weights and
weights and
see but we train in P George oh okay if
see but we train in P George oh okay if
you have a fancy Network you know if you
you have a fancy Network you know if you
have a really fancy Network like I had
have a really fancy Network like I had
to do for neural mo3 yeah there's a
to do for neural mo3 yeah there's a
little bit more work involved like this
little bit more work involved like this
is the MMO net right there's like a
is the MMO net right there's like a
little bit of stuff it's not that bad
little bit of stuff it's not that bad
though and like here this is the whole
though and like here this is the whole
network that's it that's the forward
network that's it that's the forward
pass for like a pretty damn fancy
Network and then the result of this is
Network and then the result of this is
neural mo3 policy runs in your browser
so it's not that
bad all right gotta I have
bad all right gotta I have
to I did the hard part already the hard
to I did the hard part already the hard
part was getting uh was getting the
part was getting uh was getting the
implementations of the layers to exactly
implementations of the layers to exactly
match P torch that was a pain in the ass
match P torch that was a pain in the ass
but uh you know I wrote some tests and
but uh you know I wrote some tests and
it took some time and I did
it took some time and I did
it did you stop streaming on on X no if
it did you stop streaming on on X no if
I stopped it's because it crashed
I stopped it's because it crashed
you're back I think yeah you're

night yeah why do I have why do I have
night yeah why do I have why do I have
six people watching me why do I have
six people watching me why do I have
nine people at least just like watching
nine people at least just like watching
me hang out and about RL I mean one of
me hang out and about RL I mean one of
them is me who was watch one of them is

on switch all right but I mean there are
on switch all right but I mean there are
some other people so for folks that are
some other people so for folks that are
there um I mean all this RL stuff it's
there um I mean all this RL stuff it's
free it's open source you can check

puffer doai for demos join the Discord
puffer doai for demos join the Discord
right here this is where we're all
right here this is where we're all
hanging out as you can see this is kind
hanging out as you can see this is kind
of a routine thing um I'm also I post
of a routine thing um I'm also I post
all the stuff on X and if you want to
all the stuff on X and if you want to
help us out for free star the repository
help us out for free star the repository
really helps us out
really helps us out
uh if you're looking to get into RL the
uh if you're looking to get into RL the
best way to do that is to just swing by
best way to do that is to just swing by
and start coding up a new environment
and start coding up a new environment
and get RL working on it end to end we
and get RL working on it end to end we
have like brand new people with no RL
have like brand new people with no RL
experience coming and do this it's uh
experience coming and do this it's uh
and we just need to be able to Cod
and we just need to be able to Cod
that's about it I think that's going to
that's about it I think that's going to
be it though for tonight I'm pretty
be it though for tonight I'm pretty
tired folks
tired folks
um I me take care of yourself yeah I'm
um I me take care of yourself yeah I'm
pretty tired so I think I'm going to go
pretty tired so I think I'm going to go
to sleep and then tomorrow when I get up
to sleep and then tomorrow when I get up
I'm going to do
I'm going to do
we're going to look at these hyper pram
we're going to look at these hyper pram
sweeps a little bit more uh I'm probably
sweeps a little bit more uh I'm probably
going to start looking at some
going to start looking at some
curriculum SL exploration stuff on
curriculum SL exploration stuff on
stream we'll probably look at a couple
stream we'll probably look at a couple
papers of that and fix a few puffer bugs
papers of that and fix a few puffer bugs
maybe work on a couple of our academic
maybe work on a couple of our academic
collabs we'll see I really do want to
collabs we'll see I really do want to
spin up the science side of puffer Moore
spin up the science side of puffer Moore
though so Spencer's not around and
though so Spencer's not around and
Captain's not around but I'm going to be
Captain's not around but I'm going to be
onboarding them hopefully to that
onboarding them hopefully to that
um and I think that the next steps are
um and I think that the next steps are
going to be to get get more of the
going to be to get get more of the
Baseline environments training faster in
Baseline environments training faster in
wall clock time just via like hyper pram
wall clock time just via like hyper pram
sweep stuff and then using that fast
sweep stuff and then using that fast
Baseline start modifying algorithmic
Baseline start modifying algorithmic
things and then rerunning full sweep so
things and then rerunning full sweep so
like we will launch 100 experiments per
like we will launch 100 experiments per
environment and then we'll launch like
environment and then we'll launch like
10 environments so a thousand
10 environments so a thousand
experiments per algorithmic change and
experiments per algorithmic change and
if we can get all of those to run in
if we can get all of those to run in
like single digit number of GPU
like single digit number of GPU
days I think even get that to run in
days I think even get that to run in
like three GPU days maybe and then we'll
like three GPU days maybe and then we'll
be in a good
be in a good
spot that's the
plan
plan
yes agree yeah
