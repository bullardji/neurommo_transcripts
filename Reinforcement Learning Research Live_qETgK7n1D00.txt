A lot of our stuff is in a pretty good

That's probably the only really main

Some sort of very long sweep.

What's the difficulty of neural MMO,

No, that's like what is that like uh to

But you have to know what like a

I mean, we could um we could look at

and then all of these things.
poorly normalized

These are not great.

There shouldn't be a huge difference

kind of just pretty sane.
You never set terminals.

That could be worth exploring, right?

Okay, we at least we found one thing

I mean, we can do that experiment and we

can also run a sweep, right? Those are

two things we can do,
of course, after uh we do the main

We're seeing uh results here, right?

I'm just actually learning now.
thought about working on developing a

Uh the issue is that like language model

just instantly

cuz it's slow.
I think unfortunately I have to move

That's okay. Like we kind of expected
That's okay. Like we kind of expected
this.
Just do that sooner rather than uh than
Just do that sooner rather than uh than
later.
Okay, so that is set up now.
Okay, so that is set up now.
Uh, so we should be able to get this set
Uh, so we should be able to get this set
up on puffer box zero.
Hey, Pdubs. Long time no see. How's it
Hey, Pdubs. Long time no see. How's it
going, man?
Did you see uh 3?
Did you see uh 3?
We have some pretty cool RL tech now.
And a fly apparently.
How you been?
How you been?
Heck of a lot better now that the
Heck of a lot better now that the
release is done. There's some crazy busy
release is done. There's some crazy busy
stuff.
Uh I am currently on a farm in Maryland.

This is the puffer training facility.

You can see we have servers for training

I haven't seen too much about Japa to be

Where did my terminal go?
We're currently doing a little bit of
We're currently doing a little bit of
robotic stuff on here. Just trying to
robotic stuff on here. Just trying to
see if we can chuck puffer li on things.
But yeah, I think the coolest thing
But yeah, I think the coolest thing
lately has been this. the fact that we
lately has been this. the fact that we
actually have like pretty darn good
actually have like pretty darn good
agents that just play neural MMO and uh
agents that just play neural MMO and uh
we didn't really do any work on neural
we didn't really do any work on neural
MMO. It kind of just happened from our
MMO. It kind of just happened from our
latest release.
If it finds something it can fight.
This thing is better that better at the
This thing is better that better at the
game than I am for sure.
I'll put this I'll leave this up right

How'd I end up in Maryland? I'm on my

Kind of just we needed a spot to put all

the hardware and stuff and uh I don't
the hardware and stuff and uh I don't
know, this kind of just worked out.
know, this kind of just worked out.
I will be spending some time in Palo
I will be spending some time in Palo
Alto. uh in actually just a few weeks.

That'll be cool. Um and then middle of
That'll be cool. Um and then middle of
winter Florida and then rest of the time
winter Florida and then rest of the time
building stuff out of here. Fun.
The only thing not fun about here is
The only thing not fun about here is
that uh I've got all this cool gym
that uh I've got all this cool gym
equipment and I've got a bad rotator
equipment and I've got a bad rotator
cuff and I've got a bad knee. So, I
cuff and I've got a bad knee. So, I
can't really use all of it.
can't really use all of it.
But, uh, I've gotten a lot of AI dev
But, uh, I've gotten a lot of AI dev
done since I can't really do much
Are you going to be in Palo Alto? Going
Are you going to be in Palo Alto? Going
to be in SF? I think I'm going to be
to be in SF? I think I'm going to be
there
there
maybe from like the 16th or the 17th of
maybe from like the 16th or the 17th of
July until start of August just for a
July until start of August just for a
few weeks. And then I'll be there after
few weeks. And then I'll be there after
RLC. See?
second half of July. Cool. Yeah, let's
second half of July. Cool. Yeah, let's
meet up.
meet up.
Be fun.
I imagine you've been working on some
I imagine you've been working on some
cool stuff as well.
So, we point out that this agent at the
So, we point out that this agent at the
bottom left has been playing this entire
bottom left has been playing this entire
time and is still alive.
It is currently level seven combat,
It is currently level seven combat,
level 11 forging. It has equipped a full

and some other stuff as well. Know
what's going on with this buildax? Takes
what's going on with this buildax? Takes
forever.
Oh yeah, there was the one other thing I
Oh yeah, there was the one other thing I
wanted to fix while I'm at it here.
Do I have exam today? Best of luck.
I'm quite happy that I no longer have to

I'd like to train something a bit better

We have a PR on asteroids.
We have um merged. Okay.

Okay, this is what the asteroids looks

it found the same weird policy. Then

there's probably something fundamental

Oh, I forgot about the spaceships.

Okay. So, I mean that's

it gets better in terms of score.
Damn. Is it two

Leave, man.
the heck.
I'm trying to see if there's anything

That's why
I don't know how I didn't see that.

That's silly.
I mean, I can't see any explanation

Hang on.
I got to go in a few, but let me at

See
if it does anything different.
Maybe it's one of those things where it

like emerges later in training that you

can do a little bit better if you turn

And I got to get ready for meeting.
I'll fly real quick.
Okay, so the score actually keeps going
Okay, so the score actually keeps going
up. We see this.
up. We see this.
This is what I was wondering about.
This is what I was wondering about.
You see the policy keeps getting better.
Quite a bit better, in fact.
so it's quite possible uh wouldn't you

just need to sweep it for longer.
just need to sweep it for longer.
There are also some fiddly sweep things

At least that's part of what's

Okay. Well, we can fix that for sure.
Okay. Well, we can fix that for sure.
But I do have to run for meeting. That's

I have to move this sweep.
That's okay. Like we kind of expected
That's okay. Like we kind of expected
this.
Just do that sooner rather than uh than
Just do that sooner rather than uh than
later.
Okay, so that is set up now.
Okay, so that is set up now.
Uh, so we should be able to get this set
Uh, so we should be able to get this set
up on puffer box zero.
Hey, Pdubs. Long time no see. How's it
Hey, Pdubs. Long time no see. How's it
going, man?
Did you see uh 3?
Did you see uh 3?
We have some pretty cool RL tech now.
And a fly apparently.
How you been?
How you been?
Heck of a lot better now that the
Heck of a lot better now that the
release is done. There's some crazy busy
release is done. There's some crazy busy
stuff.
Uh I am currently on a farm in Maryland.
Uh I am currently on a farm in Maryland.
This is the puffer training facility.
This is the puffer training facility.
You can see we have servers for training
You can see we have servers for training
agents and we have gym equipment for
agents and we have gym equipment for
training me.
I haven't seen too much about Japa to be
I haven't seen too much about Japa to be
honest. Don't follow a lot of robotics.
Where did my terminal go?
We're currently doing a little bit of
We're currently doing a little bit of
robotic stuff on here. Just trying to
robotic stuff on here. Just trying to
see if we can chuck puffer li on things.
But yeah, I think the coolest thing
But yeah, I think the coolest thing
lately has been this. the fact that we
lately has been this. the fact that we
actually have like pretty darn good
actually have like pretty darn good
agents that just play neural MMO and uh
agents that just play neural MMO and uh
we didn't really do any work on neural
we didn't really do any work on neural
MMO. It kind of just happened from our
MMO. It kind of just happened from our
latest release.
If it finds something it can fight.
This thing is better that better at the
This thing is better that better at the
game than I am for sure.
I'll put this I'll leave this up right
I'll put this I'll leave this up right
here.
That there
That there
then
then
tiny box.
tiny box.
Not this one.
Not this one.
Too many terminals.
Too many terminals.
This one.
How'd I end up in Maryland? I'm on my
How'd I end up in Maryland? I'm on my
family's farm here.
family's farm here.
Kind of just we needed a spot to put all
Kind of just we needed a spot to put all
the hardware and stuff and uh I don't
the hardware and stuff and uh I don't
know, this kind of just worked out.
know, this kind of just worked out.
I will be spending some time in Palo
I will be spending some time in Palo
Alto. uh in actually just a few weeks.
Alto. uh in actually just a few weeks.
That'll be cool. Um and then middle of
That'll be cool. Um and then middle of
winter Florida and then rest of the time
winter Florida and then rest of the time
building stuff out of here. Fun.
The only thing not fun about here is
The only thing not fun about here is
that uh I've got all this cool gym
that uh I've got all this cool gym
equipment and I've got a bad rotator
equipment and I've got a bad rotator
cuff and I've got a bad knee. So, I
cuff and I've got a bad knee. So, I
can't really use all of it.
can't really use all of it.
But, uh, I've gotten a lot of AI dev
But, uh, I've gotten a lot of AI dev
done since I can't really do much
Are you going to be in Palo Alto? Going
Are you going to be in Palo Alto? Going
to be in SF? I think I'm going to be
to be in SF? I think I'm going to be
there
there
maybe from like the 16th or the 17th of
maybe from like the 16th or the 17th of
July until start of August just for a
July until start of August just for a
few weeks. And then I'll be there after
few weeks. And then I'll be there after
RLC. See?
second half of July. Cool. Yeah, let's
second half of July. Cool. Yeah, let's
meet up.
meet up.
Be fun.
I imagine you've been working on some
I imagine you've been working on some
cool stuff as well.
So, we point out that this agent at the
So, we point out that this agent at the
bottom left has been playing this entire
bottom left has been playing this entire
time and is still alive.
It is currently level seven combat,
It is currently level seven combat,
level 11 forging. It has equipped a full
level 11 forging. It has equipped a full
suit of armor, a tier 2 weapon,
suit of armor, a tier 2 weapon,
and some other stuff as well. Know
what's going on with this buildax? Takes
what's going on with this buildax? Takes
forever.
Oh yeah, there was the one other thing I
Oh yeah, there was the one other thing I
wanted to fix while I'm at it here.
Do I have exam today? Best of luck.
I'm quite happy that I no longer have to
I'm quite happy that I no longer have to
do that.
I ask you questions.
You probably don't want me helping you
You probably don't want me helping you
on your exams, even if I could.
I haven't done any coursework in quite a

long time.
It's ML, please.
Ironically, I don't think I could even

do an ML exam at this point.
do an ML exam at this point.
Most of the stuff that is asked on them
Most of the stuff that is asked on them
are so freaking irrelevant, it's
are so freaking irrelevant, it's
hilarious.
at least about reinforcement.
You can ask me stuff if you want like if
You can ask me stuff if you want like if
you have questions.
my last module.

You know, I actually don't know a lot of
You know, I actually don't know a lot of
the reinforcement learning math because
the reinforcement learning math because
it's all defined stupidly.
it's all defined stupidly.
Like if you actually look at a lot of

the ways like RL is written down, none
the ways like RL is written down, none
of it makes any sense or has any

RL. There's like very very little
RL. There's like very very little
overlap
ask you about like tabular Q-learning
ask you about like tabular Q-learning
and crap.
You want to actually have reinforcement
You want to actually have reinforcement
learning that works,

check out all the stuff on puffer.ai.
check out all the stuff on puffer.ai.
It's a good place to learn things as

Do learning in SARSA.
I literally Okay. Like I I vaguely like

I mean technically, yeah, Q-learning is

yeah, they just
most RL course work is a total mess.
not envy you There.
Marov decision processes
are just a really bad problem model for

RL in general.

like you it's just uh you're in a state

assume there's a transition function

that doesn't depend on time that takes

you to the next state

and then like kind of all the RL
and then like kind of all the RL
algorithms that are based on them kind
algorithms that are based on them kind
of throw that out the window
of throw that out the window
immediately.
I don't know.
I'll tell you one thing for sure. If I
I'll tell you one thing for sure. If I
had to uh put together a course on
had to uh put together a course on
reinforcement learning, it would not
reinforcement learning, it would not
look anything like uh any of the
look anything like uh any of the
reinforcement learning courses that
reinforcement learning courses that
exist now.
Okay,
Okay,
let's see if this does anything. Well,
let's see if this does anything. Well,
obviously we won't know for like three
obviously we won't know for like three
days, but
days, but
let's see if it at least runs.
Okay, cool. So, this will run. We'll see
Okay, cool. So, this will run. We'll see
if I if anything changes with terminals.
if I if anything changes with terminals.
That'd be a pretty funny error if uh if
That'd be a pretty funny error if uh if
it did.
it did.
Would also tell us something. So,
Okay, I got about 20 minutes before I
Okay, I got about 20 minutes before I
got to run. Um, use a restroom real
got to run. Um, use a restroom real
quick and then we'll find a couple
quick and then we'll find a couple
things to do.
things to do.
Ready them in method or they still teach
Ready them in method or they still teach
us.
us.
Yep.
H a lot of like the grad course work
H a lot of like the grad course work
kind of just drove me nuts because like
kind of just drove me nuts because like
it's so out of touch.
it's so out of touch.
Can you see if you can get asteroids on
Can you see if you can get asteroids on
the site? Uh yes, let's do asteroids.
the site? Uh yes, let's do asteroids.
Actually, that's a perfect small thing
Actually, that's a perfect small thing
to do. Let me use the restroom real
to do. Let me use the restroom real
quick and then I'll do that. Be right
quick and then I'll do that. Be right
back.
The asteroids policy looks kind of
The asteroids policy looks kind of
ridiculous to stick it on the website.
ridiculous to stick it on the website.
I'd like to train something a bit better
I'd like to train something a bit better
first.
first.
We have a PR on asteroids.
We have um merged. Okay.
We have um merged. Okay.
Okay. Already merged.
Okay, this is what the asteroids looks
Okay, this is what the asteroids looks
like.
it found the same weird policy. Then
it found the same weird policy. Then
there's probably something fundamental
there's probably something fundamental
that's a little screwy with the game.
This going to be super loud.
[Music]
Trying to see if there's like a control
Trying to see if there's like a control
difference.
[Music]
Oh, I forgot about the spaceships.
Oh, I forgot about the spaceships.
I forgot that they're spaceships.
I forgot that they're spaceships.
Okay. So, I mean that's
in the original game.
No UFOs. I forget if that's in the real
No UFOs. I forget if that's in the real
game like the original
Okay. So,
it gets better in terms of score.
Damn. Is it two
probably go to sleep?
What you should do?
What do Indians not sleep?
What do Indians not sleep?
Leave, man.
the heck.
I'm trying to see if there's anything
I'm trying to see if there's anything
weird that um
weird that um
cause this
Wait, what?
Wait, what?
Why the hell did you bubble sort this,
Why the hell did you bubble sort this,
man?
man?
Yo, Wooden,
Yo, Wooden,
why would you not just call quicksort on
why would you not just call quicksort on
this?
That'll make it a heck of a lot faster.
That'll make it a heck of a lot faster.
I didn't know it existed.
I didn't know it existed.
Probably do that if Hang on. Is this
Probably do that if Hang on. Is this
thing slow?
thing slow?
21% end time.
That's why
I don't know how I didn't see that.
I don't know how I didn't see that.
That's silly.
I mean, I can't see any explanation
I mean, I can't see any explanation
other than it's just a good strategy.
It's completely possible, I guess,
It's completely possible, I guess,
right?
Hang on.
I got to go in a few, but let me at
I got to go in a few, but let me at
least try a couple things.
least try a couple things.
See
if it does anything different.
Maybe it's one of those things where it
Maybe it's one of those things where it
like emerges later in training that you
like emerges later in training that you
can do a little bit better if you turn
can do a little bit better if you turn
or something. I don't know.
And I got to get ready for meeting.
I'll fly real quick.
Okay, so the score actually keeps going
Okay, so the score actually keeps going
up. We see this.
up. We see this.
This is what I was wondering about.
This is what I was wondering about.
You see the policy keeps getting better.
Quite a bit better, in fact.
so it's quite possible uh wouldn't you
so it's quite possible uh wouldn't you
just need to sweep it for longer.
just need to sweep it for longer.
There are also some fiddly sweep things
There are also some fiddly sweep things
that can happen if it's like not ever
that can happen if it's like not ever
exploring longer uh experiments.
Yeah. So, there's additional stuff you
Yeah. So, there's additional stuff you
can configure for it. Buffer sweep is a

decent starting point.
decent starting point.
There's some stuff you can configure for

it.
This is now what's that? 28.
So, we'll see if this is just a better
So, we'll see if this is just a better
of the same thing or not.
H,
H,
okay. It's not going in a fully straight
okay. It's not going in a fully straight
line. It turned from the start.
Oh, it doesn't understand screen wrap,
Oh, it doesn't understand screen wrap,
man. Because it has relative
man. Because it has relative
coordinates. It doesn't understand
coordinates. It doesn't understand
screen wrap. That's what's happening.
At least that's part of what's
At least that's part of what's
happening.
Okay. Well, we can fix that for sure.
Okay. Well, we can fix that for sure.
But I do have to run for meeting. That's
But I do have to run for meeting. That's
a starting point. Cool. This will be
a starting point. Cool. This will be
very nice once we have it done to have
very nice once we have it done to have
on the website. Um, let me check the
on the website. Um, let me check the
stream real quick.
Okay, so to the few folks watching here,

involved with dev. I will be back
tomorrow and uh, we will probably be
