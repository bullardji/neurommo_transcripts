should be live
here
so we got to do something a little
so we got to do something a little
different today
oops got some control stuff that
oops got some control stuff that
needs looking at
at least I'm going to take a look at
at least I'm going to take a look at
this now and then depending on where I
this now and then depending on where I
get
get
um I might do something else in the
afternoon but for
afternoon but for
now got to make a little progress
here oh and hang on there were a couple
here oh and hang on there were a couple
quick emails I just needed to reply on
quick emails I just needed to reply on
the side
e e
perfect and one last thing before we get
perfect and one last thing before we get
started I just had to say one one
started I just had to say one one
Discord message
okay so what we're going to do at the
okay so what we're going to do at the
moment is we're going to
moment is we're going to
take this
repository I think I already have
cloned for
I do have this
I do have this
here but evidently not in poer lib
just make sure I'm not missing anything
just make sure I'm not missing anything
here
we want
this and that's enough
okay
so today we're going to be working on at
so today we're going to be working on at
least for a good chunk of today we're
least for a good chunk of today we're
going to be working on the Isaac gym
going to be working on the Isaac gym
stuff so this is uh humanoid robotics
stuff so this is uh humanoid robotics
control Sim in
control Sim in
simulation with puffer
simulation with puffer
lib um this is Joint work with the
lib um this is Joint work with the
collaborator of mine and he has sent
collaborator of mine and he has sent
over some cleaned up code uh basically
over some cleaned up code uh basically
what happened here is he started working
what happened here is he started working
on digging through some of these
on digging through some of these
academic code bases I put together a
academic code bases I put together a
dramatically cleaned up environment
dramatically cleaned up environment
wrapper that was like less than half the
wrapper that was like less than half the
code of the original and a fair bit
code of the original and a fair bit
faster and then he went through and he
faster and then he went through and he
cleaned up a bunch of the other stuff
cleaned up a bunch of the other stuff
around these so now we get to look at
around these so now we get to look at
this
and thing is this is in the
phc hang on I got to figure out what he
phc hang on I got to figure out what he
did here though because he's got this
did here though because he's got this
not in puffer Li
is this what I did hang
on yeah yeah this is what I did okay so
on yeah yeah this is what I did okay so
he
took no he didn't take this stuff this
took no he didn't take this stuff this
is
different for
I'm so
I'm so
confused yeah this is
needed but I'm very confused
say
24 why is this back to 2,000
24 why is this back to 2,000
lines hang on maybe this isn't his code
yeah okay no this is
not M Clean first
pass oh jeez he
did why
okay I'm going to go run this but
okay I'm going to go run this but
I I'm pretty confused
here single file
end e
well I guess I just put it
here for
wait just making sure this isn't going
wait just making sure this isn't going
to break
everything
e
e
e e
I'm hoping that this isn't going to
I'm hoping that this isn't going to
download some like Weird elf version of
download some like Weird elf version of
torch or
something let me see if I can even
something let me see if I can even
figure this
out and it's just like they should be in
out and it's just like they should be in
the puffer repo
already okay so this is like reasonable
already okay so this is like reasonable
I see what's at least done here
this the puffer
wrapper e
this is the only one where I'm just
this is the only one where I'm just
like I'm
confused cuz hang on right if I just go
confused cuz hang on right if I just go
to
I can't even tell if he used it
here it looks like
it but then there's some changes made
okay so this he definitely
used okay so he did just change
up hey how's it
up hey how's it
going I'm trying to figure out what Kung
going I'm trying to figure out what Kung
did with my code here
see I took them out of the whole bunch
see I took them out of the whole bunch
of confusing methods and I can't tell if
of confusing methods and I can't tell if
he put them back
or if you just didn't use
it okay yeah no he just didn't use it
it okay yeah no he just didn't use it
because this wouldn't be
here but he did use some of it so now
here but he did use some of it so now
I'm just very
confused so he clearly read through the
confused so he clearly read through the
end
but then he reverted a bunch of other
stuff so basically I don't know what he
stuff so basically I don't know what he
did here
how long should writing an end like pong
how long should writing an end like pong
uh I don't know cuz I didn't do pong I
uh I don't know cuz I didn't do pong I
can tell you how long the M's that I
can tell you how long the M's that I
wrote took the grid took the grid M I
wrote took the grid took the grid M I
had already a prototype of it like of a
had already a prototype of it like of a
much simpler version that had like a
much simpler version that had like a
just it had a bunch of dated stuff but I
just it had a bunch of dated stuff but I
had some structure in place
had some structure in place
and then actually um making that work
and then actually um making that work
and adding the Maze and stuff that took
and adding the Maze and stuff that took
like two
like two
days
um long
um long
take I don't know most most of the small
take I don't know most most of the small
LS are going to be between like a day
LS are going to be between like a day
and a half and you know 3
and a half and you know 3
days most of the small
ones
for e
what's happened
here probably this one doesn't matter
yep
so so something didn't install
stupid thing
nor installed great
hey what's up how's it going
we are
currently attempting to get the uh this
currently attempting to get the uh this
new code Branch with Isaac Jim and Isaac
new code Branch with Isaac Jim and Isaac
Sim
running and see if we can finish the
running and see if we can finish the
puff integration with there's some
puff integration with there's some
additional motion loading code that
additional motion loading code that
needs to get
integrated to to be
integrated to to be
fair the format that the code in now is
fair the format that the code in now is
in now looks like it will mostly be a
in now looks like it will mostly be a
drop
drop
in but there's still too much of
it but what we should be able to do from
it but what we should be able to do from
this is at least get basic training
this is at least get basic training
working and um
working and um
we should be able to do at least one of
we should be able to do at least one of
the easier imitation tasks So based on
the easier imitation tasks So based on
motion data we should be able to at
motion data we should be able to at
least get the bot doing roughly what is
least get the bot doing roughly what is
seen in the motion
seen in the motion
data
um I mean the main thing with all of
um I mean the main thing with all of
these projects is just there's like the
these projects is just there's like the
academic
academic
repos uh used as references are always
repos uh used as references are always
just so bloated that pretty much once
just so bloated that pretty much once
you clean everything up things become
you clean everything up things become
very simple and you can do whatever you
very simple and you can do whatever you
want yeah not launching coins
want yeah not launching coins
man still not launching
coins I'm doing Ultra hper RL
coins I'm doing Ultra hper RL
here not doing
crypto I I also find it pretty amusing
crypto I I also find it pretty amusing
how you always have
how you always have
multiple people multiple X accounts join
multiple people multiple X accounts join
at exactly the same
time heck of a coincidence then for that
time heck of a coincidence then for that
to happen literally every time
look if you're looking for like a
look if you're looking for like a
cool like crypto thing to get involved
cool like crypto thing to get involved
with have you seen the uh like the Teto
with have you seen the uh like the Teto
stuff
that guy seems to actually be
that guy seems to actually be
building some legitimate stuff and
building some legitimate stuff and
trying to fund it with uh with
crypto but not what I'm
doing this guy
I knew him from before this as the the
I knew him from before this as the the
admin of the C this guy he seems like
admin of the C this guy he seems like
he's actually building some
he's actually building some
legitimate like llm tools uh in C like
legitimate like llm tools uh in C like
very high performance stuff and seems to
very high performance stuff and seems to
be funny it that
way I can't tell exactly what it is he
way I can't tell exactly what it is he
is doing
is doing
um it's it seems like he's mostly just
um it's it seems like he's mostly just
building he's just doing like uh llm
building he's just doing like uh llm
stuff but lower level higher perf I
stuff but lower level higher perf I
guess which is
interesting yeah but that's not what I'm
interesting yeah but that's not what I'm
trying to go that's not the uh the path
trying to go that's not the uh the path
I'm trying to go here this is a company
I'm trying to go here this is a company
we're scaling uh Revenue through clients
interesting something not installed
correctly
wait
oh oops
I have yet to hear anybody explain what
I have yet to hear anybody explain what
web 3 is concisely in a way that does
web 3 is concisely in a way that does
not make it sound
not make it sound
[ __ ] this is the problem
no seriously like if you were to go to
no seriously like if you were to go to
like open
like open
AI or deep mind or you know like any
AI or deep mind or you know like any
like serious AI people uh and like pull
like serious AI people uh and like pull
them like hey is there is web 3 legit or
them like hey is there is web 3 legit or
just grift I guarantee you the majority
just grift I guarantee you the majority
of them are going to be like oh yeah no
of them are going to be like oh yeah no
that's [ __ ]
and the same that was the case for uh
and the same that was the case for uh
web 2 several years ago back in the day
web 2 several years ago back in the day
as well as well as mostly for
iot like it seems like there're these
iot like it seems like there're these
separate hemispheres of buzzwords that
separate hemispheres of buzzwords that
cycle
through e
yeah I actually I was very surprised
yeah I actually I was very surprised
like to give you an idea I legitimately
like to give you an idea I legitimately
thought his account get H got hacked
thought his account get H got hacked
when he launched the
thing is there a missing data file here
what on
Earth what's the end goal of the
Earth what's the end goal of the
project so reinforce M learning was a
project so reinforce M learning was a
thing before language models right
thing before language models right
before not language models but before
before not language models but before
like modern llms uh reinforcement
like modern llms uh reinforcement
learning accomplished a lot of great
learning accomplished a lot of great
things go DOTA capture the flag and yeah
things go DOTA capture the flag and yeah
we use games for a lot of it because
we use games for a lot of it because
games are a really good test bed but
games are a really good test bed but
it's also been used for like power
it's also been used for like power
optimization and data centers it can be
optimization and data centers it can be
used in manufacturing processes this is
used in manufacturing processes this is
here it's for animation
here it's for animation
generation uh it can be used in just a
generation uh it can be used in just a
lot of unintuitive optimization
lot of unintuitive optimization
processes across a ton of different
processes across a ton of different
Industries and it was working very well
Industries and it was working very well
without a huge amount of investment you
without a huge amount of investment you
know RL didn't get billions of dollars
know RL didn't get billions of dollars
the way language models have but then
the way language models have but then
people kind of just stopped working on
people kind of just stopped working on
it and uh what I'm trying to do is
it and uh what I'm trying to do is
massively revamp the space by making all
massively revamp the space by making all
the RL tooling all the simulators we use
the RL tooling all the simulators we use
for training a thousand times faster and
for training a thousand times faster and
then enabling us to do really really
then enabling us to do really really
really exhaustive experiments in science
really exhaustive experiments in science
uh in order to figure out the places
uh in order to figure out the places
that RL didn't work before and make this
that RL didn't work before and make this
way more stable way easier to get
way more stable way easier to get
working on new problems and way more
working on new problems and way more
useful for tons and tons of different
useful for tons and tons of different
Industries so really this is my effort
Industries so really this is my effort
to revamp a whole sub field of
AI it's pretty cool cuz you can actually
AI it's pretty cool cuz you can actually
like this is something you you can
like this is something you you can
actually do without having to raise
actually do without having to raise
hundreds of millions of dollars like we
hundreds of millions of dollars like we
have maybe tens of thousands in Hardware
have maybe tens of thousands in Hardware
at the moment and we will scale to
at the moment and we will scale to
hundreds of thousands in a few months
hundreds of thousands in a few months
but that's about all you need whom would
but that's about all you need whom would
your will your competitors be we don't
your will your competitors be we don't
have
have
any we don't have
any nobody else is doing
this that's kind of the way I like stuff
this that's kind of the way I like stuff
I like doing way out there things it's
I like doing way out there things it's
like if you're kind of just trying to do
like if you're kind of just trying to do
something better than the next guy I get
something better than the next guy I get
bored you know I get very
bored I mean there are people who have
bored I mean there are people who have
tried to do like industry RL things in
tried to do like industry RL things in
the past and there are like still a few
the past and there are like still a few
people that do but I mean the way that
people that do but I mean the way that
we're doing things is so massively
we're doing things is so massively
different it's not even close to
different it's not even close to
comparable we have 20,000 lines worth of
comparable we have 20,000 lines worth of
uh sea environments simulations games in
uh sea environments simulations games in
Sea that we use for training that run
Sea that we use for training that run
like a thousand times faster than most
like a thousand times faster than most
of what is out there it's just a very
of what is out there it's just a very
different scale and a very different
different scale and a very different
approach
R
R
tensor okay so this is clearly not
tensor okay so this is clearly not
installing
forly times local install brakes
so yeah I mean there is very cool Tech
so yeah I mean there is very cool Tech
around here and the reason I don't need
around here and the reason I don't need
to really look to alternate sources of
to really look to alternate sources of
funding is it's still pretty small you
funding is it's still pretty small you
know we have only got a couple of
know we have only got a couple of
clients it'll scale but um I mean it's
clients it'll scale but um I mean it's
really the type of thing where once you
really the type of thing where once you
have a company uh using the stuff in
have a company uh using the stuff in
puffer lib cuz rl's really hard right
puffer lib cuz rl's really hard right
rl's like really really hard but as soon
rl's like really really hard but as soon
as you start using some of the stuff in
as you start using some of the stuff in
puffer lib and as soon as I get my hands
puffer lib and as soon as I get my hands
on whatever it is that you're trying to
on whatever it is that you're trying to
solve people say oh my gosh like wow
solve people say oh my gosh like wow
this is like so dramatically useful um
this is like so dramatically useful um
we'd be insane not to use this this is
we'd be insane not to use this this is
where all the growth has come from
list index is this a consistent error or
list index is this a consistent error or
is this a probabilistic
error how is it that when I put a break
error how is it that when I put a break
point this stops working do I get a
point this stops working do I get a
different error
different error
no okay I do get the same
no okay I do get the same

um hey
welcome how's it
welcome how's it
going we are doing something a little
going we are doing something a little
different today working
on where is this
on where is this
working on some uh High High Fidelity
working on some uh High High Fidelity
continuous control stuff with Isaac
continuous control stuff with Isaac
gem okay so it's sample data
amass still watching really interesting
amass still watching really interesting
thank you
honestly like it's kind of funny
honestly like it's kind of funny
that when I'm like talking about stuff I
that when I'm like talking about stuff I
tend to get more people watching this
tend to get more people watching this
and it gets up to like eight or 10 but
and it gets up to like eight or 10 but
then when I like I actually have to
then when I like I actually have to
start like really working on stuff uh
start like really working on stuff uh
and fixing stuff which is probably the
and fixing stuff which is probably the
thing that people can learn the most
thing that people can learn the most
from uh people kind of get bored but
from uh people kind of get bored but
it's like it's funny because I don't do
it's like it's funny because I don't do
anything that's that complicated but
anything that's that complicated but
it's very very effective like yesterday
it's very very effective like yesterday
I took there was an academic code base
I took there was an academic code base
uh for a very good idea I spent like I
uh for a very good idea I spent like I
don't know 6 hours just picking it apart
don't know 6 hours just picking it apart
and cutting down the code cutting down
and cutting down the code cutting down
the code and I ended up with like 300
the code and I ended up with like 300
lines of code instead of 2,000 and it
lines of code instead of 2,000 and it
actually worked instead of being a
actually worked instead of being a
broken mess and it's like this is all I
broken mess and it's like this is all I
do
that's how I get stuff
done but yeah yesterday though the one
done but yeah yesterday though the one
from yesterday was particularly
from yesterday was particularly
convoluted like I actually had a
convoluted like I actually had a
headache after doing all
that unfortunately it is 7: a.m. in
that unfortunately it is 7: a.m. in
California right
California right
now I don't know if I'm getting this
now I don't know if I'm getting this
data file anytime
data file anytime
soon can I get this from
somewhere I mean I
somewhere I mean I
[Music]
[Music]
see sample
data can I just download this from
amass are you active there yeah of
amass are you active there yeah of
course
course
we have uh a lot of stuff organized in
we have uh a lot of stuff organized in
there yeah carbs is crazy we will be
there yeah carbs is crazy we will be
back to that that is um I think at the
back to that that is um I think at the
moment that's the highest leverage thing
moment that's the highest leverage thing
that I'm doing in RL um we have all
that I'm doing in RL um we have all
these environments this is going to be
these environments this is going to be
the next highest thing because this is
the next highest thing because this is
going to first of all it's going to cut
going to first of all it's going to cut
down your training time massively your
down your training time massively your
experiment time but second of all it's
experiment time but second of all it's
going to give you extreme confidence in
going to give you extreme confidence in
your experiments that you know if you
your experiments that you know if you
run something you're not going to be
run something you're not going to be
wrong because of hyper parameters you're
wrong because of hyper parameters you're
always going to have good hyper
parameters and right now that is not
parameters and right now that is not
true in RL and in fact I would say know
true in RL and in fact I would say know
a high double digigit percentage of uh
a high double digigit percentage of uh
published RL research at top conferences
published RL research at top conferences
is wrong purely because of hyper
is wrong purely because of hyper
parameters
parameters
you guys already have clients yeah we
you guys already have clients yeah we
have a
have a
couple I'm working on finding a few
couple I'm working on finding a few
more um I would ideally I'd like to have
more um I would ideally I'd like to have
somewhere between 5 and
10 that's about what I can
10 that's about what I can
support at current
support at current
scale um and that would bring us
scale um and that would bring us
to I mean that would get us enough
to I mean that would get us enough
Revenue to buy whatever Hardware um pay
Revenue to buy whatever Hardware um pay
people and like do what we
want and also it's more than that right
want and also it's more than that right
because like our stuff is still open
because like our stuff is still open
source so when we build stuff for
source so when we build stuff for
clients we're actually improving puffer
clients we're actually improving puffer
Li in the process in a very like in a
Li in the process in a very like in a
real world use case right so like this
real world use case right so like this
stuff here this is actually for a
stuff here this is actually for a
company that wants to use this for real
company that wants to use this for real
stuff that they're solving so we're
stuff that they're solving so we're
improving puffer's capabilities on this
improving puffer's capabilities on this
front at the same time even if the hyper
front at the same time even if the hyper
parameters work very well on one of the
parameters work very well on one of the
puffer M's isn't it unlikely that those
puffer M's isn't it unlikely that those
parameters are optimal for different uh
parameters are optimal for different uh
for a custom M you just rerun train you
for a custom M you just rerun train you
rerun the
rerun the
sweep and the sweep will be faster than
sweep and the sweep will be faster than
before
right so the sweep is part of your
experimentation let's just roll that
hang on got to go confirm the
hang on got to go confirm the
thing uh what we are doing at the
thing uh what we are doing at the
moment counts as non-commercial
moment counts as non-commercial
because this is open source
research so we are allowed to do that
there we go puffer lip contributors the
there we go puffer lip contributors the
ones who do client work too uh not yet
ones who do client work too uh not yet
and the reason for that is that when I
and the reason for that is that when I
am you know pitching larger contracts to
am you know pitching larger contracts to
clients uh at the moment it is is I'm
clients uh at the moment it is is I'm
pulling people like PhD students who I
pulling people like PhD students who I
have previously worked with extensively
have previously worked with extensively
on research projects so I'm basically
on research projects so I'm basically
I'm pulling highly vetted people who
I'm pulling highly vetted people who
also have pedigree uh now in the future
also have pedigree uh now in the future
it's what's likely going to happen is
it's what's likely going to happen is
from there as puer gets larger it will
from there as puer gets larger it will
start to be I start pulling in like
start to be I start pulling in like
major contributors on like a uh on a gig
major contributors on like a uh on a gig
sort of a basis paid gig sort of basis
sort of a basis paid gig sort of basis
for building specific environment stuff
for building specific environment stuff
and then from there it's like as we get
and then from there it's like as we get
larger contracts I might then be able to
larger contracts I might then be able to
bring in contributors on the engineering
bring in contributors on the engineering
side and it doesn't just have to be PhD
side and it doesn't just have to be PhD
students that's all down the road though
I guess technically one of the uh one of
I guess technically one of the uh one of
the people I'm working with now uh
the people I'm working with now uh
for contract on the cont Contracting
for contract on the cont Contracting
basis was somebody who started as a
basis was somebody who started as a
contributor to another of my open source
contributor to another of my open source
projects a while ago
I did register where's the
download what in the
download what in the
heck a ass
train I would like to know which of
train I would like to know which of
these
uh it depends who you're trying to
uh it depends who you're trying to
attract
for the vast majority of people I work
for the vast majority of people I work
with um tokenizing would be a negative
signal like a huge negative
signal like it really doesn't do
signal like it really doesn't do
anything for
me bz2 what in the
heck e
honestly I think in the
future well here if you if you want like
future well here if you if you want like
a real response to that
a real response to that
um the space has to fix itself and
um the space has to fix itself and
become associated with a legitimate
become associated with a legitimate
method
method
of as far as I see it like the most that
of as far as I see it like the most that
you could do with a token is you could
you could do with a token is you could
kind of use it to make a company public
kind of use it to make a company public
without making it public um and without
without making it public um and without
going through all of that uh and like
going through all of that uh and like
for smaller projects uh it's kind of a
for smaller projects uh it's kind of a
way to crowdsource stuff in that way um
way to crowdsource stuff in that way um
but the thing is at the moment that's
but the thing is at the moment that's
not how this is viewed it's viewed as
not how this is viewed it's viewed as
like this giant meme thing where people
like this giant meme thing where people
just like pump currency in and then
just like pump currency in and then
eventually you know people get left
eventually you know people get left
holding the bag and it's all just like a
holding the bag and it's all just like a
giant scam that is the perception that's
giant scam that is the perception that's
not my perception that is the general
not my perception that is the general
perception among serious people in Tech
perception among serious people in Tech
so and it's for the most part it is a
so and it's for the most part it is a
legitimate one as well because of just
legitimate one as well because of just
the amount of grift in the space so it's
the amount of grift in the space so it's
the type of thing where if you want uh
the type of thing where if you want uh
if you want this to be considered
if you want this to be considered
seriously you have to clean up the space
in my view it's on the existing people
in my view it's on the existing people
in this space to clean it up if you want
in this space to clean it up if you want
to bring outside people in right I do
to bring outside people in right I do
not inherently have any interest in
not inherently have any interest in
crypto right I don't my interest is in
AI so all my time and energy is in
AI so all my time and energy is in
pushing a die forward so if the crypto
pushing a die forward so if the crypto
people want to push crypto forward they
people want to push crypto forward they
got to do
that you see what I mean
I mean it's like the same thing as me
I mean it's like the same thing as me
saying hey if some of you language model
saying hey if some of you language model
people right if some of the language
people right if some of the language
modeling people came over to
modeling people came over to
reinforcement learning and helped us
reinforcement learning and helped us
build stuff right we could make this a
build stuff right we could make this a
legitimate thing that a lot more
legitimate thing that a lot more
companies see as useful faster but it's
companies see as useful faster but it's
not on those people who are doing stuff
not on those people who are doing stuff
in a different space and being
in a different space and being
successful there to come over right it's
successful there to come over right it's
on me and the other people who are in RL
on me and the other people who are in RL
to demonstrate the value of it do you
to demonstrate the value of it do you
see what I mean
so that's that is the problem that
so that's that is the problem that
you're going to have to solve if you
you're going to have to solve if you
want crypto to succeed in that way
want crypto to succeed in that way
because and you want and you need to
because and you want and you need to
have like a very clear you know why is
have like a very clear you know why is
this useful to me because it's very very
this useful to me because it's very very
hazy it's very buzzwordy at the moment
hazy it's very buzzwordy at the moment
you can't just go oh yeah web 3 right
you can't just go oh yeah web 3 right
it's like well what the hell is this
it's like well what the hell is this
right how does this benefit a project if
right how does this benefit a project if
I'm building something in a space and I
I'm building something in a space and I
don't inherently care about crypto why
don't inherently care about crypto why
is this useful to me right if some
is this useful to me right if some
company comes to me uh with RL and says
company comes to me uh with RL and says
hey you know we've got robots in a
hey you know we've got robots in a
factory and we are writing code to
factory and we are writing code to
control the way that they run around and
control the way that they run around and
it's really hard I can go oh cool well
it's really hard I can go oh cool well
we can write a simulator of that and
we can write a simulator of that and
then we can run reinforcement learning
then we can run reinforcement learning
on that we can train it on a thousand
on that we can train it on a thousand
years worth of simulated data and then
years worth of simulated data and then
the robots will just move around
the robots will just move around
perfectly and here are a bunch of
perfectly and here are a bunch of
different cases where stuff like that
different cases where stuff like that
has been done previously to to
has been done previously to to
superhuman levels right now can I say
superhuman levels right now can I say
that just yet yes I can say that but it
that just yet yes I can say that but it
would be very hard a year from now I
would be very hard a year from now I
might be able to say oh we can do
might be able to say oh we can do
something like that for you almost out
something like that for you almost out
of the box and that's the value
of the box and that's the value
right you see how I don't have to get
right you see how I don't have to get
the person to care about reinforcement
the person to care about reinforcement
learning I have I get them to care about
learning I have I get them to care about
the result it's the same thing
but again this doesn't make sense to me
but again this doesn't make sense to me
either right um ready to build on
either right um ready to build on
anything that is tokenized
I mean this is like you know this is a
I mean this is like you know this is a
new space it's highly technical this is
new space it's highly technical this is
something that requires substantial
something that requires substantial
investment to build expertise in order
investment to build expertise in order
to contribute in right like the
to contribute in right like the
contributors that came in that didn't
contributors that came in that didn't
have any RL experience they put a couple
have any RL experience they put a couple
good months of work in building
good months of work in building
environments seeing how RL models train
environments seeing how RL models train
debugging things in order to get to the
debugging things in order to get to the
point where they can now actually
point where they can now actually
productively reason about the outcomes
productively reason about the outcomes
of experiments and which experiments to
of experiments and which experiments to
run and things like this
so you know the people that we're
so you know the people that we're
looking for on the development side are
looking for on the development side are
people that are going to be interested
people that are going to be interested
in the reinforcement learning
right the heck is
this bzip to
I frankly haven't been following his
I frankly haven't been following his
closely since he tokenized because like
closely since he tokenized because like
most of the stuff on X now is no longer
most of the stuff on X now is no longer
you know deep technical content it's
you know deep technical content it's
mostly just filled with uh it's filled
mostly just filled with uh it's filled
with like crypto
with like crypto
memes so in a way like it actually it
memes so in a way like it actually it
shifted the
shifted the
space in a Direction that's pushed out a
space in a Direction that's pushed out a
lot of a lot of serious uh developers as
well right like before that happened uh
well right like before that happened uh
I would hang around that Community
I would hang around that Community
because hey there're a bunch of
because hey there're a bunch of
low-level people building stuff
low-level people building stuff
and uh you know we're using the same
and uh you know we're using the same
we're using the same low-l stack and
we're using the same low-l stack and
puffer now not so
much what in the heck is this
this gave me a non gzi tar
file what the heck
when I got to figure this
when I got to figure this
out
zaro I mean what it looks like to me is
zaro I mean what it looks like to me is
the crypto folks are making the same
the crypto folks are making the same
mistake as like every single Tech
mistake as like every single Tech
Enthusiast right which is
Enthusiast right which is
there are some people that you're going
there are some people that you're going

to be able to get excited about the tech
that you're building right you're going
that you're building right you're going
to be able to get some people excited
to be able to get some people excited
about crypto but then there is a much
about crypto but then there is a much
larger audience right that's working on
larger audience right that's working on
other Tech very technical audience even

working on other stuff that you're only
working on other stuff that you're only

nope I've never had to do that that's
nope I've never had to do that that's
funny and then the individual files
funny and then the individual files
inside of this are zipped as well what
inside of this are zipped as well what
the hell
academics okay this is like too much of
academics okay this is like too much of
a
a
mess I think I'm going to have to wait
mess I think I'm going to have to wait
for Chung
for Chung
here to figure out how to mess with this
okay as soon as he's awake I will uh
okay as soon as he's awake I will uh
he'll be up in an hour or two he's on uh
he'll be up in an hour or two he's on uh
California
time so I think in the meantime I'll go
time so I think in the meantime I'll go
back to the other stuff I was doing
back to the other stuff I was doing
which is
fine maybe you know I want to at least
fine maybe you know I want to at least
like read through some of his stuff a a
like read through some of his stuff a a
little bit more though so I'll be able
little bit more though so I'll be able
to discuss this more

to cover the set of Pito optimal uh
to cover the set of Pito optimal uh
hyper parameter sets with respect to
hyper parameter sets with respect to
cost of running the experiment usually
cost of running the experiment usually
train time and seconds and then the
train time and seconds and then the
score output uh and we are making some
score output uh and we are making some
large changes to that code and to the
large changes to that code and to the
math of that in order to improve on top
math of that in order to improve on top
of that as well we also have versions of
of that as well we also have versions of
that without basing optimization that
that without basing optimization that
still try to explore a parito front so
still try to explore a parito front so
we have a lot of different methods
we have a lot of different methods
here it does seem like uh basan
here it does seem like uh basan
optimization uh are the winners for the

most part from what I've seen
most part from what I've seen
multiobjective it's not really
multiobjective it's not really
multiobjective it's just that you take
multiobjective it's just that you take
you keep around as a candidate set the
you keep around as a candidate set the
Paro optimal points that you've explored
Paro optimal points that you've explored
so far and then you use those as the
so far and then you use those as the
search
search
centers right so the basics of the
centers right so the basics of the
algorithm are you start off by randomly
algorithm are you start off by randomly
sampling some points you figure out
sampling some points you figure out
which ones are Pito and then starting
which ones are Pito and then starting
from the Poo points you randomly sample
from the Poo points you randomly sample
points nearby and then you use uh
points nearby and then you use uh
gaussian processes and some fancy math
gaussian processes and some fancy math
to score which points you think are
to score which points you think are
going to do the best and then you use
going to do the best and then you use
those and if you discover new parito
those and if you discover new parito
points then those become new surf
points then those become new surf

multiobjective optimization whatever you
multiobjective optimization whatever you
can uh it doesn't really change the math
can uh it doesn't really change the math
and it it doesn't really change the math
and it it doesn't really change the math
or the
implementation I don't know people throw
implementation I don't know people throw
around the word multiobjective a lot in
around the word multiobjective a lot in
reinforcement learning and uh the areas
reinforcement learning and uh the areas
of ml that I look at and I've never
of ml that I look at and I've never
really understood why because we kind of
really understood why because we kind of
just run the same thing on them
anyways multi-agent is another fun one
anyways multi-agent is another fun one
as
as
well did the whole PhD on multi-agent
well did the whole PhD on multi-agent
stuff and we use the exact same
stuff and we use the exact same
algorithms a single

environment so far this is not bad I
environment so far this is not bad I
expect that is the environment then is
expect that is the environment then is
where everything kind of explodes
where everything kind of explodes
because you get this humanoid
because you get this humanoid
phc which is here and then this is going
phc which is here and then this is going
to import everything right POS lib
to import everything right POS lib
motion
motion
lib and Tor you
tails and this
thing do you think it's plausible to do
thing do you think it's plausible to do
MCTS and puffer yeah
MCTS and puffer yeah
sure
sure
um so all you would do for that you'd
um so all you would do for that you'd
pick an environment that you want this
pick an environment that you want this
to work for in puffer um there's one
to work for in puffer um there's one
change that you would want to make to
change that you would want to make to
your environment to support this better
your environment to support this better
which would be
which would be
you would want to make it so that you
you would want to make it so that you
Malik instead of having a couple
Malik instead of having a couple
different Maliks as we have now uh you
different Maliks as we have now uh you
would Mal all your memory at once so
would Mal all your memory at once so
that your state set is just a mem copy
that your state set is just a mem copy
so you have really really fast State
so you have really really fast State
sets um and then you would just like
sets um and then you would just like
look at clean puff RL replace the PO
look at clean puff RL replace the PO
portions of the logic with MCTS and then
portions of the logic with MCTS and then
you would have really fast
you would have really fast
MCTS wondered if there Pito front with
MCTS wondered if there Pito front with
only no parito optimality is by it's
only no parito optimality is by it's
multivariate yes by definition a Pito
multivariate yes by definition a Pito
front is only defined when you have
front is only defined when you have
multiple variables um the point is that
multiple variables um the point is that
it is the set of parito points with
it is the set of parito points with
respect to cost and score are the set of
respect to cost and score are the set of
points for which you cannot find
points for which you cannot find
something that has both higher score and
something that has both higher score and
lower experiment
runtime yeah but
runtime yeah but
xpct the um the idea with puffer lib is
xpct the um the idea with puffer lib is
puffer is not a giant repository of
puffer is not a giant repository of
algorithm implementations right we work
algorithm implementations right we work
a lot more on lower level infrastructure
a lot more on lower level infrastructure
we work on other areas of things that
we work on other areas of things that
are like underinvested in stuff like
are like underinvested in stuff like
hyperparameter search uh we work on like
hyperparameter search uh we work on like
tweaks to existing algorithms for the
tweaks to existing algorithms for the
most part but the goal is not to just
most part but the goal is not to just
have a big repository of all the
have a big repository of all the
existing algorithms now that said you
existing algorithms now that said you
know if you have an existing algorithm
know if you have an existing algorithm
clean RL has a lot of them right and our
clean RL has a lot of them right and our
trainer is based on clean RL it just has
trainer is based on clean RL it just has
some extra log in some performance
some extra log in some performance
optimizations so you can just take your
optimizations so you can just take your
algorithm code put it into our trainer
algorithm code put it into our trainer
and then there you go you have you know
and then there you go you have you know
your algorithm with all our nice fast
your algorithm with all our nice fast
optimizations
but yeah we're way more interested in
but yeah we're way more interested in
finding like the good algorithm
finding like the good algorithm
generally to use
everywhere then we are in trying to like
everywhere then we are in trying to like
provide a repository of existing
provide a repository of existing
algorithms that you have to try all of
them and so far we're based on PO CU
them and so far we're based on PO CU
that's simple it works very well U
that's simple it works very well U
doesn't mean it will always be the case
doesn't mean it will always be the case
we might just we might just need some
we might just we might just need some
small modifications to PO we might need
small modifications to PO we might need
to do something completely different
to do something completely different
we'll see but so far this has been
we'll see but so far this has been
good and you know po does have precedent
good and you know po does have precedent
of solving very hard
problems okay so all this is technically
problems okay so all this is technically
just to fix up the
just to fix up the
data so if we forgive
data so if we forgive
this and there's some stuff to forgive
this and there's some stuff to forgive
here because this is 1200 freaking lines
here because this is 1200 freaking lines
of code
of code
this is 6 700 lines of
code
HC okay this is my code so I don't have
HC okay this is my code so I don't have
to read this and this is like kind of
to read this and this is like kind of
portions of my code I think mixed
with mix with the original massive
with mix with the original massive
code yeah so like this is the
original but he cleaned it up at least
original but he cleaned it up at least
so this is no longer calling like
so this is no longer calling like
super and stuff
but like I see so he's cleaned it up
but like I see so he's cleaned it up
he's kind of like unnested all the
he's kind of like unnested all the
horrible functions that were being used
horrible functions that were being used
in a way but he hasn't understood
in a way but he hasn't understood
why the functions were there in the
why the functions were there in the
first place because like the only reason
first place because like the only reason
to have these three separate functions
to have these three separate functions
uh is because of all the horrible
uh is because of all the horrible
inheritance that was being done before
inheritance that was being done before
you can just put the code here or you
you can just put the code here or you
can make it one function
can make it one function
like there's no reason to have a pre a
like there's no reason to have a pre a
physic step and a post
physic step and a post
now your functions are allowed to be
long okay this is new
I remember this
code J Puff
code J Puff
spaces so we just added this in here and
spaces so we just added this in here and
kept all of
this I mean I'd rather just this be
this I mean I'd rather just this be
hardcoded because it's already hardcoded
hardcoded because it's already hardcoded
to the base model so like this is
redundant okay so this is where you use
redundant okay so this is where you use
motion Leb
at least this looks like it's easier to
at least this looks like it's easier to
work with though
yeah okay
y I read this
y I read this
before okay so I think I sort of have an
before okay so I think I sort of have an
idea of
idea of
what happened
here and then I okay so I have an idea
here and then I okay so I have an idea
of what happened here at least
of what happened here at least
cool let's go from here to back to the
cool let's go from here to back to the
cool hyperparameter tuning stuff at
cool hyperparameter tuning stuff at
least until kyung is up so to give a
least until kyung is up so to give a
brief overview of what I was doing in uh
brief overview of what I was doing in uh
hyper parameter sweeping stuff I think
hyper parameter sweeping stuff I think
this is the most important thing I can
this is the most important thing I can
work on in reinforcement learning right
work on in reinforcement learning right
now because if you get this right the
now because if you get this right the
entire cost of running RL experiments
entire cost of running RL experiments
drops by probably a factor of anywhere
drops by probably a factor of anywhere
from 2 to
from 2 to
um and also you get to be way more
um and also you get to be way more
confident in the outcome of your
confident in the outcome of your
experiments just weigh higher confidence
experiments just weigh higher confidence
science which is always
science which is always
good so this paper right this is based
good so this paper right this is based
on Pito
on Pito
optimality uses basian optimization the
optimality uses basian optimization the
goal is to discover the front of Pito
goal is to discover the front of Pito
optimal points that is the set of points
optimal points that is the set of points
uh the set of hyperparameters the set of
uh the set of hyperparameters the set of
experiments for which you can't find to
experiments for which you can't find to
be a set of hyper parameters that will
be a set of hyper parameters that will
be both faster and higher scoring than
be both faster and higher scoring than
than what I have now that is the high
than what I have now that is the high
level of it um to do that there is a
level of it um to do that there is a
very simple base algorithm uh the simple
very simple base algorithm uh the simple
the very simple version of the algorithm
the very simple version of the algorithm
is that you take some random samples you
is that you take some random samples you
find which points are parito optimal so
find which points are parito optimal so
which points are on that curve I can
which points are on that curve I can
draw it real quick
so if this is if you have some points
so if this is if you have some points
like
this if you have some points like this
this if you have some points like this
then the Pito points the Pito front is
then the Pito points the Pito front is
like this right these are the points
like this right these are the points
that are Pito optimal because there's
that are Pito optimal because there's
nothing to the up and right there's
nothing to the up and right there's
nothing over
nothing over
here um so what you can do is you can
here um so what you can do is you can
randomly sample some data let's say
randomly sample some data let's say
these points come from random samples
these points come from random samples
then what you do is you start looking
then what you do is you start looking
around these
around these
points you start looking around in
points you start looking around in
hyperparameter space and then you try to
hyperparameter space and then you try to
put points here here here here and here
put points here here here here and here
so on and then uh you can do this just
so on and then uh you can do this just
by randomly sampling experiments like
by randomly sampling experiments like
randomly sampling around these points
randomly sampling around these points
but uh you can also do a whole bunch of
but uh you can also do a whole bunch of
math and try do
better I will put the current math on
better I will put the current math on
screen we have made some changes to this
screen we have made some changes to this
since
since
um we've made some major changes to this
right and I believe that we had
Neil V to no mean
Neil V to no mean
okay viiz Pi M
okay viiz Pi M
V2 this was the experiment that we
V2 this was the experiment that we
started on
started on
last
time this somewhere and then
okay so this is what we got from
yesterday let me look at
yesterday let me look at
this there's quite a lot of math I'm
this there's quite a lot of math I'm
keeping in my head at the moment but I
keeping in my head at the moment but I
will try to talk through my thoughts in
will try to talk through my thoughts in
a way that they're at least somewhat
a way that they're at least somewhat
intelligible
um where is the
um where is the
here it
here it
is normalized for mean minus norest
is normalized for mean minus norest
normalized nearest burito
score I would not expect this to produce
score I would not expect this to produce
that Gra
you should get something uniform along
you should get something uniform along
this line from this function um I think
this line from this function um I think
what's Happening Here is it's the way
what's Happening Here is it's the way
the score is being
normalized normalize for me normalized
normalized normalize for me normalized
nearest parito
score okay this
score okay this
Isen to be able to connect
me that's the thing nobody who I know
me that's the thing nobody who I know
who is in my circle would do that they'd
who is in my circle would do that they'd
look at me like I'm nuts right they they
look at me like I'm nuts right they they
would literally like they'd probably try
would literally like they'd probably try
to like email me and tell me that my
to like email me and tell me that my
Discord account or whatever I message
Discord account or whatever I message
them on got
them on got
hacked do you see what I
mean that's the problem that you've got
mean that's the problem that you've got
to fix is right now you can you can only
to fix is right now you can you can only
like do this with people who are already
like do this with people who are already
in your space because of the perception
in your space because of the perception
that you have of that
that you have of that
space I mean because of the the
space I mean because of the the
perception around that space that's the
perception around that space that's the
thing to work on
I don't know it's more basic like
I don't know it's more basic like
business than it is Tech and
business than it is Tech and
uh I uh I took some like some classes at
uh I uh I took some like some classes at
uh the business school while I was at
uh the business school while I was at
MIT and I realized that it's you know
MIT and I realized that it's you know
it's way way easier as a tech person to
it's way way easier as a tech person to
just get some of those business skills
just get some of those business skills
than it is vice versa it's very very
than it is vice versa it's very very
simple stuff
simple stuff
right it's like person you're talking to
right it's like person you're talking to
cares about Hardware or AI or something
cares about Hardware or AI or something
that's not crypto you're trying to sell
that's not crypto you're trying to sell
them because it's crypto they don't care

right they think that you're like that
right they think that you're like that
your thing is a
your thing is a
scam you demonstrate value you try to
scam you demonstrate value you try to
like you work to push out some of the
like you work to push out some of the
grifters or at least minimize their
grifters or at least minimize their
impact you say hey this can do X Y and Z
impact you say hey this can do X Y and Z
for you people are happy it's very
for you people are happy it's very
simple
right you can give me plenty of examp
right you can give me plenty of examp
examples but the thing is like these are
examples but the thing is like these are
just going to be considered outliers
just going to be considered outliers
until you shift the whole mass of it

better
right like yeah look if I were clever
right like yeah look if I were clever
right if I were if I'm a clever person
right if I were if I'm a clever person
and I cared about crypto and I wanted to
and I cared about crypto and I wanted to
fund something using crypto I could
fund something using crypto I could
probably come up with some cool way to
probably come up with some cool way to
basically allow people to invest in a
basically allow people to invest in a
company without having to be subject to
company without having to be subject to
the regulations uh the normal
the regulations uh the normal
regulations via crypto while still being

legal that's basically what you could do
legal that's basically what you could do

um
right it's like you're you can IPO
right it's like you're you can IPO
without iping and potentially with more
without iping and potentially with more
favorable
terms and you can IPO on day
terms and you can IPO on day
one um
at least until the government catches up
at least until the government catches up
and decides to come up with some way
and decides to come up with some way
that you can't do
that I'm on your side
that I'm on your side
there you got to get the damn grifters
out e
I think I need the inverse of this
I think I need the inverse of this
function I think that's what it comes
function I think that's what it comes
down to is I need to be able to undo the
down to is I need to be able to undo the
Quant transform
here but I don't really want to have to
here but I don't really want to have to
undo the quantal
transform send you
majority that doesn't make a difference
majority that doesn't make a difference
that's still being affiliated with it
but the thing is you again it's like I'm
but the thing is you again it's like I'm
doing legit Tech work here people see
doing legit Tech work here people see
that I'm not going to compromise that by
that I'm not going to compromise that by
stepping into a space that's just filled
stepping into a space that's just filled
with grifters and
charlatans you
see even if there were some upside like
see even if there were some upside like
some substantial upside I'd have to
some substantial upside I'd have to
balance it against that
like there simply isn't a compelling
like there simply isn't a compelling
argument
hey welcome
I'm not doing nothing at the moment by
I'm not doing nothing at the moment by
the way I'm still thinking through
the way I'm still thinking through
this
this
um so I mean what's happening at the
um so I mean what's happening at the
moment as far as I can tell with
moment as far as I can tell with
this this where is
it this here is the difference between
it this here is the difference between
the score of this like of a point say
the score of this like of a point say
this point here and the score of the
this point here and the score of the
nearest Paro
nearest Paro
point so it's this vertical distance
point so it's this vertical distance
except that it's normalized by a
except that it's normalized by a
quantile
quantile
transform
so oh I think I see what's happening
the only agreement that you're going to
the only agreement that you're going to
get out of me right is that you could
get out of me right is that you could
have a really good vehicle in fact the
have a really good vehicle in fact the
vehicle of getting like Community
vehicle of getting like Community
crowdsource like projects decentralized
crowdsource like projects decentralized
projects open source Dev off the ground
projects open source Dev off the ground
and running and well funded without all
and running and well funded without all
the normal strings of VC you could have
the normal strings of VC you could have
something really good there but it's not
something really good there but it's not
there at the moment
here let me let me tell you what this
here let me let me tell you what this
would be like right this would be like
would be like right this would be like
if instead of Hosting uh puffer
if instead of Hosting uh puffer
discussions and stuff on Discord what if
discussions and stuff on Discord what if
I hosted all of the all of the
I hosted all of the all of the
communications on ham if that's even
communications on ham if that's even
still
still
around what would the reception be to
that that's about the quality of the
that that's about the quality of the
brand that you have
brand that you have
behind behind new tokens
wel come
back so hopefully this is useful
back so hopefully this is useful
information assuming that you you know
information assuming that you you know
you're not just purely trying to
you're not just purely trying to
convince me of this and you are looking
convince me of this and you are looking
for that
I mean the whole meme coin shitcoin
I mean the whole meme coin shitcoin
pump. fun thing is not helping you know
pump. fun thing is not helping you know
if this is your objective like even the
if this is your objective like even the
existance and the prevalence of this is
existance and the prevalence of this is
not helping
I don't know the particular reason by
I don't know the particular reason by
the way for um the dev ecosystem being
the way for um the dev ecosystem being
around Solana maybe there is a a
around Solana maybe there is a a
technical reason for it but as an
technical reason for it but as an
outsider if I were trying to actually do
outsider if I were trying to actually do
that right if I were trying to actually
that right if I were trying to actually
make that happen I would distance myself
make that happen I would distance myself
as much as possible from the existing
as much as possible from the existing
mess I'd probably do it on bitcoin or
mess I'd probably do it on bitcoin or
ethereum probably Bitcoin and you know I
ethereum probably Bitcoin and you know I
would just I would work to push all of
would just I would work to push all of
that side
that side
out
right that's what I would
do how much money there is on versus
do how much money there is on versus
Bitcoin
no
way market cap for meme projects or
way market cap for meme projects or
market cap
total well yes to which
I mean again for all the reasons I've SA
I mean again for all the reasons I've SA
you're not going to get me onto this
you're not going to get me onto this
thing all I can do is tell you how I
thing all I can do is tell you how I
would go about trying to fix the
would go about trying to fix the
ecosystem if I were actually going to
ecosystem if I were actually going to
but like I'm I'm doing AI stuff
right I think I have as well in the
right I think I have as well in the
during this process I think I figured
out I think I figured out what is going
out I think I figured out what is going
on
on
here so so this is a quantile
transform it starts by taking this
transform it starts by taking this
data and
data and
ranking essenti it's almost like a rank
ranking essenti it's almost like a rank
transform uh it just replaces each point
transform uh it just replaces each point
with the percentile it is in the data so
with the percentile it is in the data so
this would be like this is probably like
this would be like this is probably like
20% of the data is down here or 30% and
20% of the data is down here or 30% and
this is maybe
this is maybe
40% uh but then it converts it to a unit
40% uh but then it converts it to a unit
normal so I think that what happens then
normal so I think that what happens then
is the mean is going to be around
is the mean is going to be around
here and then it creates a long tail
here and then it creates a long tail
distribution over here so the distance
distribution over here so the distance
between these two points is actually
between these two points is actually
quite large and the distance between
quite large and the distance between
points over here is quite
points over here is quite
small which is not at all what we want
okay big
okay big
number is that trillion yeah
number is that trillion yeah
wait yeah that's
trillion yeah tiny fraction
again but where's the volume coming
again but where's the volume coming
coming from
you see this quantile
you see this quantile
so I think it's the Earth
so I think it's the Earth
inverse is where we go
wrong but there's still an issue here
wrong but there's still an issue here
right
cost I think we need to use
cost I think we need to use
cost okay I think I see the
cost okay I think I see the
problem I see the
problem I see the
problem okay so here's the issue
problem okay so here's the issue
right for folks I think I've actually
right for folks I think I've actually
figured this out in the meantime
figured this out in the meantime
which so this is the issue
let's say that you have one parito front
let's say that you have one parito front
that looks like
this it's a
this it's a
line this one would be very easy uh to
line this one would be very easy uh to
optimize because what you can do is say
optimize because what you can do is say
hey if I have this existing Point here
hey if I have this existing Point here
and I have this existing Point here and
and I have this existing Point here and
I want to evaluate the quality of this
I want to evaluate the quality of this
point here as a sample
point here as a sample
I just take this distance right I just
I just take this distance right I just
subtract the distance from the nearest
subtract the distance from the nearest
Paro point in height space but the issue
Paro point in height space but the issue
with doing
with doing
this is that you can also have a parito
this is that you can also have a parito
front that looks like
this where it's pretty darn flat towards
this where it's pretty darn flat towards
the top not exactly flat but pretty darn
flat um so if you do
that then you can't do a vertical
that then you can't do a vertical
distance at
all what if you do horizontal distance
all what if you do horizontal distance
instead so if you have a point here you
instead so if you have a point here you
have a point
here it's this
here it's this
distance this point still has to be
distance this point still has to be
better but you can't use the magnitude
better but you can't use the magnitude
of the
Improvement I would consider doing it if
Improvement I would consider doing it if
there were clear value demonstrated and
there were clear value demonstrated and
right now it's clearly negative
it's like why do I host all the stuff in
it's like why do I host all the stuff in
Discord CU Discord is like I is and is
Discord CU Discord is like I is and is
recognized as the clear place to do this
recognized as the clear place to do this
stuff I think this makes me negative
stuff I think this makes me negative
money at the moment
M welcome
M welcome
Captain I think I figured something out
Captain I think I figured something out
on these
on these
sweeps I'm trying to think if there's
sweeps I'm trying to think if there's
anything wrong with
this there
this there
with the way it is currently there's
with the way it is currently there's
like there's no way you're going to
like there's no way you're going to
convince me of this you'd have to change
convince me of this you'd have to change
the
ecosystem the only thing you can
ecosystem the only thing you can
convince me is that there's potential if
convince me is that there's potential if
you fix the
ecosystem so the issue is that even uh
ecosystem so the issue is that even uh
so Captain the issue is even with the
so Captain the issue is even with the
quantile transform vertical distance
quantile transform vertical distance
doesn't give you what you want so this
doesn't give you what you want so this
is without a cost penalty and I think
is without a cost penalty and I think
what's happened here so you do the
what's happened here so you do the
quantal transform right and then you
quantal transform right and then you
pull it into normalized
pull it into normalized
space so it's uniform normal and then
space so it's uniform normal and then
what happens is like the mean is right
what happens is like the mean is right
here and that means that uh the gaussian
here and that means that uh the gaussian
has the long tails out this way and this
has the long tails out this way and this
way so the distance between these like
way so the distance between these like
these close little points here in this
these close little points here in this
normalized space is very large and the
normalized space is very large and the
same over here here so you end up
same over here here so you end up
getting just a ton of samples over here
getting just a ton of samples over here
and it will very slowly creep towards
and it will very slowly creep towards
the
the
center is not what you want and if you
center is not what you want and if you
were to undo um the normalization step
were to undo um the normalization step
and just have the quantile transform
and just have the quantile transform
well the quantile transform it just
well the quantile transform it just
gives you a percentage you just get a a
gives you a percentage you just get a a
percentage of the data that you're
percentage of the data that you're
better so here you're better than say
better so here you're better than say
40% of the data and if they're 100
40% of the data and if they're 100
points here you're better than 41 42
points here you're better than 41 42
it's just like a rank transform uh but
it's just like a rank transform uh but
then the distance you see between this
then the distance you see between this
point and this point is only one which
point and this point is only one which
is the same as the distance between this
is the same as the distance between this
point and this point is also one so it
point and this point is also one so it
really doesn't help you uh you still
really doesn't help you uh you still
aren't going to get the effect of
aren't going to get the effect of
filling in the parito front if that's
filling in the parito front if that's
what you
want if I do it based on cost like doing
want if I do it based on cost like doing
it based on cost I think the only way to
it based on cost I think the only way to
actually get the predo front filled
in I mean the only other thing you could
in I mean the only other thing you could
do right is you would have to figure out
do right is you would have to figure out
how to linearize
okay wait hang
okay wait hang
on you now exploring hyper Prem not
on you now exploring hyper Prem not
really the cost space kind of but the
really the cost space kind of but the
thing is they're
linked hang on is there a way to make
linked hang on is there a way to make
this
this
uniform Norm uniform linear
does that work
somehow okay the other thing I could
somehow okay the other thing I could
think of
think of
right is there a way to
right is there a way to
transform the score space to always be
transform the score space to always be
linear
I think I just need to I need to work on
I think I just need to I need to work on
inverting this function because if if I
inverting this function because if if I
invert this function then at the very
invert this function then at the very
least I can test it on
least I can test it on
this because here the score space is
this because here the score space is
legitimately

in any way around my
project the most helpful thing at the

getting more RL people interested in the

um that's the main thing
speaking of which Captain if you're
speaking of which Captain if you're
still around we um I should take a look
still around we um I should take a look
at your environment as of late um yeah
at your environment as of late um yeah
there's a bunch more cool science side
there's a bunch more cool science side
stuff to be done
here so hopefully we can get that I can
here so hopefully we can get that I can
take a look and help fix up any issues
take a look and help fix up any issues
with baselines on the on that
with baselines on the on that
environment and get that added pretty
environment and get that added pretty
soon that'd be awesome it's a really

cool environment I'd like to at least
cool environment I'd like to at least
throw together a quick Shader or two for
throw together a quick Shader or two for
it just to Jazz it up a bit that' be
fun okay
so take all this
oh
oh
good it gets even faster that's all the
better yeah it just needs to be jazzed
better yeah it just needs to be jazzed
up a little bit
right just so people see it for
what do we think the odds are that this
what do we think the odds are that this
got this correct on the first try not
got this correct on the first try not
even remotely
close oh that's
hilarious it literally just like wrote
hilarious it literally just like wrote
normalized scores and then filled it in
normalized scores and then filled it in
the same exact way that's so
the same exact way that's so
stupid for

literally have like dozens of

this and you think I'm going to engage
with this ecosystem at all of course not
I have 2 FAA on it it's fine

and I'm just trying to build AI stuff
here
let me
just do this real quick
just going to keep that for records
because that sounded like a
threat e
yeah the thing is he's just going to
yeah the thing is he's just going to
come back on another account I'm
come back on another account I'm
sure I might just work off stream today
sure I might just work off stream today
we'll see
mhm
this is definitely fairly distracting
this is definitely fairly distracting
though I want to get this stuff done you
though I want to get this stuff done you
see okay
see okay
so Target
so I get to
Target how does this have an
inverse I really don't want to have to
inverse I really don't want to have to
use this stupid
thing e
back projection to original
space transform
okay so this is just it
and I do not like the this
transform I really don't like this
transform I really don't like this
function that they're using it's kind of
function that they're using it's kind of
a
mess is there something else I could do
mess is there something else I could do
with it let me
with it let me
think than here
and they Clause it to match
uniform I mean it's like a thing that
uniform I mean it's like a thing that
makes sense to do but
let me see I might be able to replace
let me see I might be able to replace
this with something simpler because I
this with something simpler because I
really do not like the uh the added
really do not like the uh the added
complexity from
this no did not launch that's
this no did not launch that's
fake there is no launch
um let me
[Applause]
see nope
this is an AI project
go find how I have this at the moment
oops WR

start guide
here and start by building a just a
here and start by building a just a
really basic RL environment to get a
really basic RL environment to get a
sense of how things work especially if
sense of how things work especially if
you come in without an RL background
yeah I don't know why they're
doing e
why did they
specifically there was a comment in
specifically there was a comment in
there
right using preserves more distance
right using preserves more distance
information within the quantiles
you know at this point I almost don't
you know at this point I almost don't
care if this thing works better it's
care if this thing works better it's
just like it's complex there's no
just like it's complex there's no
intuition behind this I don't see how it
intuition behind this I don't see how it
fits here and I want it out of the code
fits here and I want it out of the code
base
base
um yeah let me I we can just run a quick
um yeah let me I we can just run a quick
experiment as well to
see so get rid of
see so get rid of
this for
let me real
quick
e e
go fig we do
that what's this function rank
data oops
what did I
what did I
use I used
use I used
quantile yeah I don't need quantile I
quantile yeah I don't need quantile I
just
need divided
by yeah that's fine the plus one is
fine s pile
course nor score
okay
mod
for e
is is this going to produce dramatically
is is this going to produce dramatically
different
behavior that would also be
interesting h
there anything else wrong
there anything else wrong
here normalize
near and know this is fine whatever I
near and know this is fine whatever I
get up whatever I apply to this will be
get up whatever I apply to this will be
applied to the parito front so I'll just
applied to the parito front so I'll just
have to wait and
have to wait and
see how this
see how this
uh how this thing explores outward
oh the thing is that this is still a
oh the thing is that this is still a
gaussian
so it should push to the
extremities we will see doesn't seem
extremities we will see doesn't seem
like it's really doing that
like it's really doing that
yet but um
here let's just prepare
here let's just prepare
this
so e
okay so this thing is pushing up in cost
okay so this thing is pushing up in cost
so that's something at least and then
so that's something at least and then
we'll see what happens when we
we'll see what happens when we
unnormalized
it
e for
got up to
40s well I think that because of the
40s well I think that because of the
rank transform
there's not a huge amount of
there's not a huge amount of
differentiation between the points at
differentiation between the points at
the very end
right yeah there's not a huge amount of
right yeah there's not a huge amount of
differ okay so that that's a
differ okay so that that's a
problem can I
somehow well I have to undo the
somehow well I have to undo the
percentile don't I
see this just gets us back to
percentile this just gets us to
percentile this just gets us to
percentile and then we have to
unnormalized believe we have to
unnormalized believe we have to
unnormalized
thank you just calling
turp for
yeah let's see what this gives
us so this is not
us so this is not
good but the other one wasn't good it
good but the other one wasn't good it
was just bad in a different
way uh that's
terrible really don't like that
I should they have to
be oh no that's kind of gross
actually so this is obnoxious because I
actually so this is obnoxious because I
think you
think you
need I think you do need the rank
transform I'm pretty sure you do need
transform I'm pretty sure you do need
the rank
the rank
transform let me explain what's going on
transform let me explain what's going on
here
here
right oh wait wait wait hold
right oh wait wait wait hold
on we can test it we can test it without
on we can test it we can test it without
the rank
the rank
transform because I have linear data in
transform because I have linear data in
this test okay let me try this and then
this test okay let me try this and then
I'll explain this at least should let us
I'll explain this at least should let us
construct a reasonable test and then
construct a reasonable test and then
we'll see if this is worth dealing with
okay
so here's the
so here's the
idea uh we were doing this
prematurely so if you have something
prematurely so if you have something
that looks like this you cannot rely on
that looks like this you cannot rely on
the magnitude on the Y AIS the score of
the magnitude on the Y AIS the score of
these points for really
these points for really
anything cuz the Paro front can have so
anything cuz the Paro front can have so
many different
many different
shapes but because we have linear data
shapes but because we have linear data
for this test test and we know it is
for this test test and we know it is
linear data we should be able to skip
linear data we should be able to skip
the rank transform now when I tested
the rank transform now when I tested
this previously I forgot to uh convert
this previously I forgot to uh convert
the data to standard normal so that'll
the data to standard normal so that'll
mess it up but now what I have is data
mess it up but now what I have is data
gets converted to standard
gets converted to standard
normal prediction happens in standard
normal prediction happens in standard
normal space which is what you want for
normal space which is what you want for
Gan
Gan
process and then the unnormalized is
process and then the unnormalized is
very simple because we didn't have to
very simple because we didn't have to
deal with the rank
deal with the rank
transform uh and then what this should
transform uh and then what this should
let us do is test the algorithm nicely
let us do is test the algorithm nicely
on linear data and actually get some
on linear data and actually get some
reasonable
reasonable
results and then we can decide what data
results and then we can decide what data
transform needs to be applied to handle
transform needs to be applied to handle
uh different score
uh different score
distributions right
oh is this doing what I think it
oh is this doing what I think it
is this is
hilarious it's like laddering its way
hilarious it's like laddering its way
down actually
if this is actually what it's doing it's
if this is actually what it's doing it's
too smart for its own
good I'm looking at it and that's what
good I'm looking at it and that's what
it's
doing I guess that would make
sense okay we're gonna let this finish
sense okay we're gonna let this finish
and then I'll explain I'll explain what
and then I'll explain I'll explain what
I think it's
done that's
done that's
hilarious I think it's literally
hilarious I think it's literally
gotten the algorithm is too good for
gotten the algorithm is too good for
it's too smart for its own good
it's too smart for its own good
here it found a way to cheat my
here it found a way to cheat my
objective yeah so the rank transform was
objective yeah so the rank transform was
just screwing everything up I
think and now it's going to something
think and now it's going to something
more
more
reasonable I didn't see like a bunch of
reasonable I didn't see like a bunch of
50s ever did I oh no they're 50s it
50s ever did I oh no they're 50s it
still should fill in uh there's some
still should fill in uh there's some
other regions that should fill in though
do you see that most most of the points
do you see that most most of the points
are slowly working their way down 113
are slowly working their way down 113
111 it's got a very accurate cost model
111 it's got a very accurate cost model
as well so it's very good at doing
this and then there are some other ones
this and then there are some other ones
it looks like it's also working its way
it looks like it's also working its way
down from
down from
82 it's working its way down from
82 it's working its way down from
multiple points
simultaneously don't know about that
180 this is going to be a crazy looking
180 this is going to be a crazy looking
graph
the funny thing is I can't even be mad
the funny thing is I can't even be mad
because this
is is this a straight A straight screw
is is this a straight A straight screw
up in my
original no it's a property of the cost
original no it's a property of the cost
actually in this
actually in this
case
case
interesting it all comes down to the
interesting it all comes down to the
scaling of the cost and the score if you
scaling of the cost and the score if you
have these things to these two things
have these things to these two things
scaled correctly it should
work I'm actually tempted to now try
work I'm actually tempted to now try
this on the log cost
problem e
so
so
funny so what's happened here I'm pretty
funny so what's happened here I'm pretty
confident at this
confident at this
point is I specified the
point is I specified the
reward for this
reward for this
experiment as the
experiment as the
improvement over the next lowest cost
improvement over the next lowest cost
Paro point so what it's done done here
Paro point so what it's done done here
is it's gotten some random samples that
is it's gotten some random samples that
are very high cost and then there are
are very high cost and then there are
some other points that are Paro points
some other points that are Paro points
that are like way to the left and it's
that are like way to the left and it's
just going a little tiny bit to the left
just going a little tiny bit to the left
and getting the full reward and going a
and getting the full reward and going a
little bit to the left of that one and
little bit to the left of that one and
getting the full reward and it's just
getting the full reward and it's just
repeating that
continuously so it's like lading its way
continuously so it's like lading its way
down from the top
yeah look at
this that's one heck of a crazy
graph it started up here and it worked
graph it started up here and it worked
its way down it started up here and it
its way down it started up here and it
worked its way down it started up here
worked its way down it started up here
and it worked its way
down so technically this is one of the
down so technically this is one of the
better results that we've gotten in
better results that we've gotten in
terms of coverage but um it's still
terms of coverage but um it's still
clearly not working the way we want
clearly not working the way we want
right it's making these little tiny
right it's making these little tiny
jumps instead of trying to actively
jumps instead of trying to actively
cover the Paro front
are you kidding
me freaking messing with my Discord now
me freaking messing with my Discord now
[ __ ]
[ __ ]
off
e e
real
quick
e
e e
just fixing a couple
things e
okay
okay
so back to
this if the increment is divided by the
this if the increment is divided by the
cost
it's still not going to fix it
right e
okay I think I just need to think to
okay I think I just need to think to
reformulate this objective a little bit
reformulate this objective a little bit
because the penalty term that I
because the penalty term that I
introduced will definitely cause this
introduced will definitely cause this
every
time
e e
the thing is I don't want to explicit L
the thing is I don't want to explicit L
have a term that tells you to spread out
have a term that tells you to spread out
in CL spr space do
I maybe I
do for
you want to fill out the Paro front
okay hang on
thing is I think that even difference in
thing is I think that even difference in
rank could be really unstable
right e
I think they're like they two
I think they're like they two
competing issues here
okay what if for now I just think about
okay what if for now I just think about
this instance I sto trying to think
this instance I sto trying to think
about the harder ones in my head at the
about the harder ones in my head at the
same
time performance increment
by
cost distance to nearest
Point performance divided by distance to
Point performance divided by distance to
nearest burrito point
that loses the notion of though of
capturing you really just want the
capturing you really just want the
divisor term to have
divisor term to have
cost be performance per
cost no that's fine the top thing can
cost no that's fine the top thing can
have a divisor as
well it's like Information
Gain
e e
technically the algorithm would work as
technically the algorithm would work as
is if
um no it really would never work as
is yeah
okay pretty much the only way you're
okay pretty much the only way you're
ever going to
ever going to
get a filled in parito front is by
get a filled in parito front is by
explicitly having a cost term I think we
explicitly having a cost term I think we
should accept
should accept
that
so let me try
so let me try
something
for
e
e e
okay so
here got this distance
lost
mean Jus
scores this is just going to
be for now
this do what I
want yeah so
score
score
no times right
score times distance to nearest
burrito we'll see what this does I have
burrito we'll see what this does I have
no idea
what happened here
uh uh
PE
for for
can't I just do this
yeah that looks good hopefully I did it
yeah that looks good hopefully I did it
right
okay these predictions suck so I messed
okay these predictions suck so I messed
something up
it just took a
it just took a
while was
weird okay there's definitely a weird
weird okay there's definitely a weird
boundary
boundary
issue we'll let that run for a bit
nearby I'm going to go use the restroom
nearby I'm going to go use the restroom
I'll be
I'll be
back um I got to do a couple other quick
back um I got to do a couple other quick
things I'll be back this will run we'll
things I'll be back this will run we'll
continue on this for a bit at
least
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e e
okay
oops cool I got some replies back
so let's see what this
is and I'm going to actually I'm going
is and I'm going to actually I'm going
to keep this one as
to keep this one as
well okay so this actually gives
well okay so this actually gives
us pretty darn even coverage
right
right
these I don't know what these
these I don't know what these
are uh we can look at that there a
are uh we can look at that there a
couple of these like
couple of these like
columns this one's the one that doesn't
columns this one's the one that doesn't
make sense to me right here
a couple of these columns
a couple of these columns
here but generally this is pretty nicely
spread hey
Ryan how's it going
man we're currently doing very weird
man we're currently doing very weird
hyper Prem op
things I got one that like selects
things I got one that like selects
points and then tries to slowly drip
points and then tries to slowly drip
down and
down and
cost did you see the new
cost did you see the new
mazm it's pretty
mazm it's pretty
cool I have it I posted it on
here doors well I wasn't going to put
here doors well I wasn't going to put
doors in The Mazes right I have a mini
doors in The Mazes right I have a mini
grid thing
though actually I can just do
so here's the initial maze
right here's your initial maze this is
right here's your initial maze this is
tiny
one you can just
dos for
thank you might have seen
this this like mini grid style
this this like mini grid style
task we have to get this key to open
task we have to get this key to open
this door
we have a few
things I'm very very fast as
things I'm very very fast as
well
well
so I figur this is going to be puffer is
so I figur this is going to be puffer is
going to be doing some exploration and
going to be doing some exploration and
possibly curriculum stuff rather soon uh
possibly curriculum stuff rather soon uh
so yeah there's going to be
so yeah there's going to be
uh there going to be some things around
uh there going to be some things around
that also I should go check on uh
oops I might have a
uh okay I got to go uh I might have a
uh okay I got to go uh I might have a
random meetings on the books I will be

Kind: captions
Language: en
should be live
here
so we got to do something a little
so we got to do something a little
different today
oops got some control stuff that
oops got some control stuff that
needs looking at
at least I'm going to take a look at
at least I'm going to take a look at
this now and then depending on where I
this now and then depending on where I
get
get
um I might do something else in the
afternoon but for
afternoon but for
now got to make a little progress
here oh and hang on there were a couple
here oh and hang on there were a couple
quick emails I just needed to reply on
quick emails I just needed to reply on
the side
e e
perfect and one last thing before we get
perfect and one last thing before we get
started I just had to say one one
started I just had to say one one
Discord message
okay so what we're going to do at the
okay so what we're going to do at the
moment is we're going to
moment is we're going to
take this
repository I think I already have
cloned for
I do have this
I do have this
here but evidently not in poer lib
just make sure I'm not missing anything
just make sure I'm not missing anything
here
we want
this and that's enough
okay
so today we're going to be working on at
so today we're going to be working on at
least for a good chunk of today we're
least for a good chunk of today we're
going to be working on the Isaac gym
going to be working on the Isaac gym
stuff so this is uh humanoid robotics
stuff so this is uh humanoid robotics
control Sim in
control Sim in
simulation with puffer
simulation with puffer
lib um this is Joint work with the
lib um this is Joint work with the
collaborator of mine and he has sent
collaborator of mine and he has sent
over some cleaned up code uh basically
over some cleaned up code uh basically
what happened here is he started working
what happened here is he started working
on digging through some of these
on digging through some of these
academic code bases I put together a
academic code bases I put together a
dramatically cleaned up environment
dramatically cleaned up environment
wrapper that was like less than half the
wrapper that was like less than half the
code of the original and a fair bit
code of the original and a fair bit
faster and then he went through and he
faster and then he went through and he
cleaned up a bunch of the other stuff
cleaned up a bunch of the other stuff
around these so now we get to look at
around these so now we get to look at
this
and thing is this is in the
phc hang on I got to figure out what he
phc hang on I got to figure out what he
did here though because he's got this
did here though because he's got this
not in puffer Li
is this what I did hang
on yeah yeah this is what I did okay so
on yeah yeah this is what I did okay so
he
took no he didn't take this stuff this
took no he didn't take this stuff this
is
different for
I'm so
I'm so
confused yeah this is
needed but I'm very confused
say
24 why is this back to 2,000
24 why is this back to 2,000
lines hang on maybe this isn't his code
yeah okay no this is
not M Clean first
pass oh jeez he
did why
okay I'm going to go run this but
okay I'm going to go run this but
I I'm pretty confused
here single file
end e
well I guess I just put it
here for
wait just making sure this isn't going
wait just making sure this isn't going
to break
everything
e
e
e e
I'm hoping that this isn't going to
I'm hoping that this isn't going to
download some like Weird elf version of
download some like Weird elf version of
torch or
something let me see if I can even
something let me see if I can even
figure this
out and it's just like they should be in
out and it's just like they should be in
the puffer repo
already okay so this is like reasonable
already okay so this is like reasonable
I see what's at least done here
this the puffer
wrapper e
this is the only one where I'm just
this is the only one where I'm just
like I'm
confused cuz hang on right if I just go
confused cuz hang on right if I just go
to
I can't even tell if he used it
here it looks like
it but then there's some changes made
okay so this he definitely
used okay so he did just change
up hey how's it
up hey how's it
going I'm trying to figure out what Kung
going I'm trying to figure out what Kung
did with my code here
see I took them out of the whole bunch
see I took them out of the whole bunch
of confusing methods and I can't tell if
of confusing methods and I can't tell if
he put them back
or if you just didn't use
it okay yeah no he just didn't use it
it okay yeah no he just didn't use it
because this wouldn't be
here but he did use some of it so now
here but he did use some of it so now
I'm just very
confused so he clearly read through the
confused so he clearly read through the
end
but then he reverted a bunch of other
stuff so basically I don't know what he
stuff so basically I don't know what he
did here
how long should writing an end like pong
how long should writing an end like pong
uh I don't know cuz I didn't do pong I
uh I don't know cuz I didn't do pong I
can tell you how long the M's that I
can tell you how long the M's that I
wrote took the grid took the grid M I
wrote took the grid took the grid M I
had already a prototype of it like of a
had already a prototype of it like of a
much simpler version that had like a
much simpler version that had like a
just it had a bunch of dated stuff but I
just it had a bunch of dated stuff but I
had some structure in place
had some structure in place
and then actually um making that work
and then actually um making that work
and adding the Maze and stuff that took
and adding the Maze and stuff that took
like two
like two
days
um long
um long
take I don't know most most of the small
take I don't know most most of the small
LS are going to be between like a day
LS are going to be between like a day
and a half and you know 3
and a half and you know 3
days most of the small
ones
for e
what's happened
here probably this one doesn't matter
yep
so so something didn't install
stupid thing
nor installed great
hey what's up how's it going
we are
currently attempting to get the uh this
currently attempting to get the uh this
new code Branch with Isaac Jim and Isaac
new code Branch with Isaac Jim and Isaac
Sim
running and see if we can finish the
running and see if we can finish the
puff integration with there's some
puff integration with there's some
additional motion loading code that
additional motion loading code that
needs to get
integrated to to be
integrated to to be
fair the format that the code in now is
fair the format that the code in now is
in now looks like it will mostly be a
in now looks like it will mostly be a
drop
drop
in but there's still too much of
it but what we should be able to do from
it but what we should be able to do from
this is at least get basic training
this is at least get basic training
working and um
working and um
we should be able to do at least one of
we should be able to do at least one of
the easier imitation tasks So based on
the easier imitation tasks So based on
motion data we should be able to at
motion data we should be able to at
least get the bot doing roughly what is
least get the bot doing roughly what is
seen in the motion
seen in the motion
data
um I mean the main thing with all of
um I mean the main thing with all of
these projects is just there's like the
these projects is just there's like the
academic
academic
repos uh used as references are always
repos uh used as references are always
just so bloated that pretty much once
just so bloated that pretty much once
you clean everything up things become
you clean everything up things become
very simple and you can do whatever you
very simple and you can do whatever you
want yeah not launching coins
want yeah not launching coins
man still not launching
coins I'm doing Ultra hper RL
coins I'm doing Ultra hper RL
here not doing
crypto I I also find it pretty amusing
crypto I I also find it pretty amusing
how you always have
how you always have
multiple people multiple X accounts join
multiple people multiple X accounts join
at exactly the same
time heck of a coincidence then for that
time heck of a coincidence then for that
to happen literally every time
look if you're looking for like a
look if you're looking for like a
cool like crypto thing to get involved
cool like crypto thing to get involved
with have you seen the uh like the Teto
with have you seen the uh like the Teto
stuff
that guy seems to actually be
that guy seems to actually be
building some legitimate stuff and
building some legitimate stuff and
trying to fund it with uh with
crypto but not what I'm
doing this guy
I knew him from before this as the the
I knew him from before this as the the
admin of the C this guy he seems like
admin of the C this guy he seems like
he's actually building some
he's actually building some
legitimate like llm tools uh in C like
legitimate like llm tools uh in C like
very high performance stuff and seems to
very high performance stuff and seems to
be funny it that
way I can't tell exactly what it is he
way I can't tell exactly what it is he
is doing
is doing
um it's it seems like he's mostly just
um it's it seems like he's mostly just
building he's just doing like uh llm
building he's just doing like uh llm
stuff but lower level higher perf I
stuff but lower level higher perf I
guess which is
interesting yeah but that's not what I'm
interesting yeah but that's not what I'm
trying to go that's not the uh the path
trying to go that's not the uh the path
I'm trying to go here this is a company
I'm trying to go here this is a company
we're scaling uh Revenue through clients
interesting something not installed
correctly
wait
oh oops
I have yet to hear anybody explain what
I have yet to hear anybody explain what

just grift I guarantee you the majority
just grift I guarantee you the majority

yeah I actually I was very surprised
like to give you an idea I legitimately

Industries and it was working very well

without a huge amount of investment you
without a huge amount of investment you
know RL didn't get billions of dollars
know RL didn't get billions of dollars
the way language models have but then
the way language models have but then
people kind of just stopped working on
people kind of just stopped working on
it and uh what I'm trying to do is
it and uh what I'm trying to do is
massively revamp the space by making all
massively revamp the space by making all
the RL tooling all the simulators we use
the RL tooling all the simulators we use
for training a thousand times faster and
for training a thousand times faster and
then enabling us to do really really
then enabling us to do really really
really exhaustive experiments in science
really exhaustive experiments in science
uh in order to figure out the places
uh in order to figure out the places
that RL didn't work before and make this

way more stable way easier to get
way more stable way easier to get
working on new problems and way more
working on new problems and way more
useful for tons and tons of different

Industries so really this is my effort
Industries so really this is my effort
to revamp a whole sub field of
AI it's pretty cool cuz you can actually

have maybe tens of thousands in Hardware
at the moment and we will scale to

I like doing way out there things it's

like if you're kind of just trying to do
like if you're kind of just trying to do
something better than the next guy I get
something better than the next guy I get
bored you know I get very
bored I mean there are people who have
bored I mean there are people who have
tried to do like industry RL things in
tried to do like industry RL things in
the past and there are like still a few
the past and there are like still a few
people that do but I mean the way that
people that do but I mean the way that
we're doing things is so massively
we're doing things is so massively

to really look to alternate sources of

funding is it's still pretty small you
know we have only got a couple of
know we have only got a couple of
clients it'll scale but um I mean it's
clients it'll scale but um I mean it's
really the type of thing where once you
really the type of thing where once you
have a company uh using the stuff in
have a company uh using the stuff in
puffer lib cuz rl's really hard right

rl's like really really hard but as soon
rl's like really really hard but as soon
as you start using some of the stuff in

gem okay so it's sample data
amass still watching really interesting
amass still watching really interesting
thank you
honestly like it's kind of funny
honestly like it's kind of funny
that when I'm like talking about stuff I
that when I'm like talking about stuff I
tend to get more people watching this
tend to get more people watching this
and it gets up to like eight or 10 but
and it gets up to like eight or 10 but
then when I like I actually have to
then when I like I actually have to
start like really working on stuff uh
start like really working on stuff uh
and fixing stuff which is probably the
and fixing stuff which is probably the
thing that people can learn the most
thing that people can learn the most
from uh people kind of get bored but
from uh people kind of get bored but
it's like it's funny because I don't do
it's like it's funny because I don't do
anything that's that complicated but
anything that's that complicated but
it's very very effective like yesterday
it's very very effective like yesterday
I took there was an academic code base
I took there was an academic code base
uh for a very good idea I spent like I
uh for a very good idea I spent like I
don't know 6 hours just picking it apart
don't know 6 hours just picking it apart
and cutting down the code cutting down
and cutting down the code cutting down
the code and I ended up with like 300
the code and I ended up with like 300
lines of code instead of 2,000 and it
lines of code instead of 2,000 and it
actually worked instead of being a
actually worked instead of being a
broken mess and it's like this is all I
broken mess and it's like this is all I
do
that's how I get stuff
done but yeah yesterday though the one
done but yeah yesterday though the one
from yesterday was particularly
from yesterday was particularly
convoluted like I actually had a
convoluted like I actually had a
headache after doing all
that unfortunately it is 7: a.m. in
that unfortunately it is 7: a.m. in
California right
California right
now I don't know if I'm getting this
now I don't know if I'm getting this
data file anytime
data file anytime
soon can I get this from
somewhere I mean I
somewhere I mean I
[Music]
[Music]
see sample
data can I just download this from
amass are you active there yeah of
amass are you active there yeah of
course
course
we have uh a lot of stuff organized in
we have uh a lot of stuff organized in
there yeah carbs is crazy we will be
there yeah carbs is crazy we will be
back to that that is um I think at the
back to that that is um I think at the
moment that's the highest leverage thing
moment that's the highest leverage thing
that I'm doing in RL um we have all
that I'm doing in RL um we have all
these environments this is going to be
these environments this is going to be
the next highest thing because this is
the next highest thing because this is
going to first of all it's going to cut
going to first of all it's going to cut
down your training time massively your
down your training time massively your
experiment time but second of all it's
experiment time but second of all it's
going to give you extreme confidence in
going to give you extreme confidence in
your experiments that you know if you
your experiments that you know if you
run something you're not going to be
run something you're not going to be
wrong because of hyper parameters you're
wrong because of hyper parameters you're
always going to have good hyper
parameters and right now that is not
parameters and right now that is not
true in RL and in fact I would say know
true in RL and in fact I would say know
a high double digigit percentage of uh
a high double digigit percentage of uh
published RL research at top conferences
published RL research at top conferences
is wrong purely because of hyper
is wrong purely because of hyper
parameters
parameters
you guys already have clients yeah we
you guys already have clients yeah we
have a
have a
couple I'm working on finding a few
couple I'm working on finding a few
more um I would ideally I'd like to have
more um I would ideally I'd like to have
somewhere between 5 and
10 that's about what I can
10 that's about what I can
support at current
support at current
scale um and that would bring us
scale um and that would bring us
to I mean that would get us enough
to I mean that would get us enough
Revenue to buy whatever Hardware um pay
Revenue to buy whatever Hardware um pay
people and like do what we
want and also it's more than that right
want and also it's more than that right
because like our stuff is still open
because like our stuff is still open
source so when we build stuff for
source so when we build stuff for
clients we're actually improving puffer
clients we're actually improving puffer
Li in the process in a very like in a
Li in the process in a very like in a
real world use case right so like this
real world use case right so like this
stuff here this is actually for a
stuff here this is actually for a
company that wants to use this for real
company that wants to use this for real
stuff that they're solving so we're
stuff that they're solving so we're
improving puffer's capabilities on this
improving puffer's capabilities on this
front at the same time even if the hyper
front at the same time even if the hyper
parameters work very well on one of the
parameters work very well on one of the
puffer M's isn't it unlikely that those
puffer M's isn't it unlikely that those
parameters are optimal for different uh
parameters are optimal for different uh
for a custom M you just rerun train you
for a custom M you just rerun train you
rerun the
rerun the
sweep and the sweep will be faster than
sweep and the sweep will be faster than
before
right so the sweep is part of your
experimentation let's just roll that
hang on got to go confirm the
hang on got to go confirm the
thing uh what we are doing at the
thing uh what we are doing at the
moment counts as non-commercial
moment counts as non-commercial
because this is open source
research so we are allowed to do that
there we go puffer lip contributors the
there we go puffer lip contributors the
ones who do client work too uh not yet
ones who do client work too uh not yet
and the reason for that is that when I
and the reason for that is that when I
am you know pitching larger contracts to
am you know pitching larger contracts to
clients uh at the moment it is is I'm
clients uh at the moment it is is I'm
pulling people like PhD students who I
pulling people like PhD students who I
have previously worked with extensively
have previously worked with extensively
on research projects so I'm basically
on research projects so I'm basically
I'm pulling highly vetted people who
I'm pulling highly vetted people who
also have pedigree uh now in the future
also have pedigree uh now in the future
it's what's likely going to happen is
it's what's likely going to happen is
from there as puer gets larger it will
from there as puer gets larger it will
start to be I start pulling in like
start to be I start pulling in like
major contributors on like a uh on a gig
major contributors on like a uh on a gig
sort of a basis paid gig sort of basis
sort of a basis paid gig sort of basis
for building specific environment stuff
for building specific environment stuff
and then from there it's like as we get
and then from there it's like as we get
larger contracts I might then be able to
larger contracts I might then be able to
bring in contributors on the engineering
bring in contributors on the engineering
side and it doesn't just have to be PhD
side and it doesn't just have to be PhD
students that's all down the road though
I guess technically one of the uh one of
I guess technically one of the uh one of
the people I'm working with now uh
the people I'm working with now uh
for contract on the cont Contracting
for contract on the cont Contracting
basis was somebody who started as a
basis was somebody who started as a
contributor to another of my open source
contributor to another of my open source
projects a while ago
I did register where's the
download what in the
download what in the
heck a ass
train I would like to know which of
train I would like to know which of
these
uh it depends who you're trying to
uh it depends who you're trying to
attract
for the vast majority of people I work
for the vast majority of people I work
with um tokenizing would be a negative
signal like a huge negative
signal like it really doesn't do
signal like it really doesn't do
anything for
me bz2 what in the
heck e
honestly I think in the
future well here if you if you want like
future well here if you if you want like
a real response to that
a real response to that
um the space has to fix itself and
um the space has to fix itself and
become associated with a legitimate
become associated with a legitimate
method
method
of as far as I see it like the most that
of as far as I see it like the most that
you could do with a token is you could
you could do with a token is you could
kind of use it to make a company public
kind of use it to make a company public
without making it public um and without
without making it public um and without
going through all of that uh and like
going through all of that uh and like
for smaller projects uh it's kind of a
for smaller projects uh it's kind of a
way to crowdsource stuff in that way um
way to crowdsource stuff in that way um
but the thing is at the moment that's
but the thing is at the moment that's
not how this is viewed it's viewed as
not how this is viewed it's viewed as
like this giant meme thing where people
like this giant meme thing where people
just like pump currency in and then
just like pump currency in and then
eventually you know people get left
eventually you know people get left
holding the bag and it's all just like a
holding the bag and it's all just like a
giant scam that is the perception that's
giant scam that is the perception that's
not my perception that is the general
not my perception that is the general
perception among serious people in Tech
perception among serious people in Tech
so and it's for the most part it is a
so and it's for the most part it is a
legitimate one as well because of just
legitimate one as well because of just
the amount of grift in the space so it's
the amount of grift in the space so it's
the type of thing where if you want uh
the type of thing where if you want uh
if you want this to be considered
if you want this to be considered
seriously you have to clean up the space
in my view it's on the existing people
in my view it's on the existing people
in this space to clean it up if you want
in this space to clean it up if you want
to bring outside people in right I do
to bring outside people in right I do
not inherently have any interest in
not inherently have any interest in
crypto right I don't my interest is in
AI so all my time and energy is in
AI so all my time and energy is in
pushing a die forward so if the crypto
pushing a die forward so if the crypto
people want to push crypto forward they
people want to push crypto forward they
got to do
that you see what I mean
I mean it's like the same thing as me
I mean it's like the same thing as me
saying hey if some of you language model
saying hey if some of you language model
people right if some of the language
people right if some of the language
modeling people came over to
modeling people came over to
reinforcement learning and helped us
reinforcement learning and helped us
build stuff right we could make this a
build stuff right we could make this a
legitimate thing that a lot more
legitimate thing that a lot more
companies see as useful faster but it's
companies see as useful faster but it's
not on those people who are doing stuff
not on those people who are doing stuff
in a different space and being
in a different space and being
successful there to come over right it's
successful there to come over right it's
on me and the other people who are in RL
on me and the other people who are in RL
to demonstrate the value of it do you
to demonstrate the value of it do you
see what I mean
so that's that is the problem that
so that's that is the problem that
you're going to have to solve if you
you're going to have to solve if you
want crypto to succeed in that way
want crypto to succeed in that way
because and you want and you need to
because and you want and you need to
have like a very clear you know why is
have like a very clear you know why is
this useful to me because it's very very
this useful to me because it's very very
hazy it's very buzzwordy at the moment
hazy it's very buzzwordy at the moment
you can't just go oh yeah web 3 right
you can't just go oh yeah web 3 right
it's like well what the hell is this
it's like well what the hell is this
right how does this benefit a project if
right how does this benefit a project if
I'm building something in a space and I
I'm building something in a space and I
don't inherently care about crypto why
don't inherently care about crypto why
is this useful to me right if some
is this useful to me right if some
company comes to me uh with RL and says
company comes to me uh with RL and says
hey you know we've got robots in a
hey you know we've got robots in a
factory and we are writing code to
factory and we are writing code to
control the way that they run around and
control the way that they run around and
it's really hard I can go oh cool well
it's really hard I can go oh cool well
we can write a simulator of that and
we can write a simulator of that and
then we can run reinforcement learning
then we can run reinforcement learning
on that we can train it on a thousand
on that we can train it on a thousand
years worth of simulated data and then
years worth of simulated data and then
the robots will just move around
the robots will just move around
perfectly and here are a bunch of
perfectly and here are a bunch of
different cases where stuff like that
different cases where stuff like that
has been done previously to to
has been done previously to to
superhuman levels right now can I say
superhuman levels right now can I say
that just yet yes I can say that but it
that just yet yes I can say that but it
would be very hard a year from now I
would be very hard a year from now I
might be able to say oh we can do
might be able to say oh we can do
something like that for you almost out
something like that for you almost out
of the box and that's the value
of the box and that's the value
right you see how I don't have to get
right you see how I don't have to get
the person to care about reinforcement
the person to care about reinforcement
learning I have I get them to care about
learning I have I get them to care about
the result it's the same thing
but again this doesn't make sense to me
but again this doesn't make sense to me
either right um ready to build on
either right um ready to build on
anything that is tokenized
I mean this is like you know this is a
I mean this is like you know this is a
new space it's highly technical this is
new space it's highly technical this is
something that requires substantial
something that requires substantial
investment to build expertise in order
investment to build expertise in order
to contribute in right like the
to contribute in right like the
contributors that came in that didn't
contributors that came in that didn't
have any RL experience they put a couple
have any RL experience they put a couple
good months of work in building
good months of work in building
environments seeing how RL models train
environments seeing how RL models train
debugging things in order to get to the
debugging things in order to get to the
point where they can now actually
point where they can now actually
productively reason about the outcomes
productively reason about the outcomes
of experiments and which experiments to
of experiments and which experiments to
run and things like this
so you know the people that we're
so you know the people that we're
looking for on the development side are
looking for on the development side are
people that are going to be interested
people that are going to be interested
in the reinforcement learning
right the heck is
this bzip to
I frankly haven't been following his
I frankly haven't been following his
closely since he tokenized because like
closely since he tokenized because like
most of the stuff on X now is no longer
most of the stuff on X now is no longer
you know deep technical content it's
you know deep technical content it's
mostly just filled with uh it's filled
mostly just filled with uh it's filled
with like crypto
with like crypto
memes so in a way like it actually it
memes so in a way like it actually it
shifted the
shifted the
space in a Direction that's pushed out a
space in a Direction that's pushed out a
lot of a lot of serious uh developers as
well right like before that happened uh
well right like before that happened uh
I would hang around that Community
I would hang around that Community
because hey there're a bunch of
because hey there're a bunch of
low-level people building stuff
low-level people building stuff
and uh you know we're using the same
and uh you know we're using the same
we're using the same low-l stack and
we're using the same low-l stack and
puffer now not so
much what in the heck is this
this gave me a non gzi tar
file what the heck
when I got to figure this
when I got to figure this
out
zaro I mean what it looks like to me is
zaro I mean what it looks like to me is
the crypto folks are making the same
the crypto folks are making the same
mistake as like every single Tech
mistake as like every single Tech
Enthusiast right which is
Enthusiast right which is
there are some people that you're going
there are some people that you're going
to be able to get excited about the tech
to be able to get excited about the tech
that you're building right you're going
that you're building right you're going
to be able to get some people excited
to be able to get some people excited
about crypto but then there is a much
about crypto but then there is a much
larger audience right that's working on
larger audience right that's working on
other Tech very technical audience even
other Tech very technical audience even
working on other stuff that you're only
working on other stuff that you're only
going to be able to get excited about
going to be able to get excited about
you know what it can do for the thing
you know what it can do for the thing
that they're interested in working on
that they're interested in working on
you know regardless of interest in your

nope I've never had to do that that's
nope I've never had to do that that's
funny and then the individual files
funny and then the individual files
inside of this are zipped as well what
inside of this are zipped as well what
the hell
academics okay this is like too much of
academics okay this is like too much of
a
a
mess I think I'm going to have to wait
mess I think I'm going to have to wait
for Chung
for Chung
here to figure out how to mess with this
okay as soon as he's awake I will uh
okay as soon as he's awake I will uh
he'll be up in an hour or two he's on uh
he'll be up in an hour or two he's on uh
California
time so I think in the meantime I'll go
time so I think in the meantime I'll go
back to the other stuff I was doing
back to the other stuff I was doing
which is
fine maybe you know I want to at least
fine maybe you know I want to at least
like read through some of his stuff a a
like read through some of his stuff a a
little bit more though so I'll be able
little bit more though so I'll be able
to discuss this more
to discuss this more
clearly so let me see exactly what it is
clearly so let me see exactly what it is
that's going on here
that's going on here
so puff forel has this

I don't I do not like these because
I don't I do not like these because
layer Norm is always

cost of running the experiment usually
cost of running the experiment usually
train time and seconds and then the
train time and seconds and then the

score output uh and we are making some
large changes to that code and to the
large changes to that code and to the
math of that in order to improve on top
math of that in order to improve on top
of that as well we also have versions of
of that as well we also have versions of
that without basing optimization that
that without basing optimization that
still try to explore a parito front so
still try to explore a parito front so
we have a lot of different methods
we have a lot of different methods
here it does seem like uh basan
here it does seem like uh basan
optimization uh are the winners for the
optimization uh are the winners for the
most part from what I've seen
most part from what I've seen
multiobjective it's not really
multiobjective it's not really
multiobjective it's just that you take
multiobjective it's just that you take
you keep around as a candidate set the
you keep around as a candidate set the
Paro optimal points that you've explored
Paro optimal points that you've explored
so far and then you use those as the

search
search
centers right so the basics of the
centers right so the basics of the
algorithm are you start off by randomly
algorithm are you start off by randomly
sampling some points you figure out
sampling some points you figure out
which ones are Pito and then starting
which ones are Pito and then starting
from the Poo points you randomly sample
from the Poo points you randomly sample
points nearby and then you use uh
points nearby and then you use uh
gaussian processes and some fancy math
gaussian processes and some fancy math
to score which points you think are
to score which points you think are
going to do the best and then you use
going to do the best and then you use
those and if you discover new parito
those and if you discover new parito
points then those become new surf
points then those become new surf

multiobjective optimization whatever you
multiobjective optimization whatever you
can uh it doesn't really change the math
can uh it doesn't really change the math
and it it doesn't really change the math
and it it doesn't really change the math
or the
implementation I don't know people throw
implementation I don't know people throw
around the word multiobjective a lot in
around the word multiobjective a lot in
reinforcement learning and uh the areas
reinforcement learning and uh the areas
of ml that I look at and I've never
of ml that I look at and I've never
really understood why because we kind of
really understood why because we kind of
just run the same thing on them
anyways multi-agent is another fun one
anyways multi-agent is another fun one
as
as
well did the whole PhD on multi-agent
well did the whole PhD on multi-agent
stuff and we use the exact same
stuff and we use the exact same
algorithms a single

agent okay so here's the
policy here's the
policy here's the
environment so far this is not bad I
environment so far this is not bad I
expect that is the environment then is
expect that is the environment then is
where everything kind of explodes
where everything kind of explodes
because you get this humanoid
because you get this humanoid
phc which is here and then this is going
phc which is here and then this is going
to import everything right POS lib
to import everything right POS lib
motion
motion
lib and Tor you
tails and this
thing do you think it's plausible to do
thing do you think it's plausible to do
MCTS and puffer yeah
MCTS and puffer yeah
sure
sure
um so all you would do for that you'd
um so all you would do for that you'd
pick an environment that you want this
pick an environment that you want this
to work for in puffer um there's one
to work for in puffer um there's one
change that you would want to make to
change that you would want to make to
your environment to support this better
your environment to support this better
which would be
which would be
you would want to make it so that you
you would want to make it so that you
Malik instead of having a couple
Malik instead of having a couple
different Maliks as we have now uh you
different Maliks as we have now uh you
would Mal all your memory at once so
would Mal all your memory at once so
that your state set is just a mem copy
that your state set is just a mem copy
so you have really really fast State
so you have really really fast State
sets um and then you would just like
sets um and then you would just like
look at clean puff RL replace the PO
look at clean puff RL replace the PO
portions of the logic with MCTS and then
portions of the logic with MCTS and then
you would have really fast
you would have really fast
MCTS wondered if there Pito front with
MCTS wondered if there Pito front with
only no parito optimality is by it's
only no parito optimality is by it's
multivariate yes by definition a Pito
multivariate yes by definition a Pito
front is only defined when you have
front is only defined when you have
multiple variables um the point is that
multiple variables um the point is that
it is the set of parito points with
it is the set of parito points with
respect to cost and score are the set of
respect to cost and score are the set of
points for which you cannot find
points for which you cannot find
something that has both higher score and
something that has both higher score and
lower experiment
runtime yeah but
runtime yeah but
xpct the um the idea with puffer lib is
xpct the um the idea with puffer lib is
puffer is not a giant repository of
puffer is not a giant repository of
algorithm implementations right we work
algorithm implementations right we work
a lot more on lower level infrastructure
a lot more on lower level infrastructure
we work on other areas of things that
we work on other areas of things that
are like underinvested in stuff like
are like underinvested in stuff like
hyperparameter search uh we work on like
hyperparameter search uh we work on like
tweaks to existing algorithms for the
tweaks to existing algorithms for the
most part but the goal is not to just
most part but the goal is not to just
have a big repository of all the
have a big repository of all the
existing algorithms now that said you
existing algorithms now that said you
know if you have an existing algorithm
know if you have an existing algorithm
clean RL has a lot of them right and our
clean RL has a lot of them right and our
trainer is based on clean RL it just has
trainer is based on clean RL it just has
some extra log in some performance
some extra log in some performance
optimizations so you can just take your
optimizations so you can just take your
algorithm code put it into our trainer
algorithm code put it into our trainer
and then there you go you have you know
and then there you go you have you know
your algorithm with all our nice fast
your algorithm with all our nice fast
optimizations
but yeah we're way more interested in
but yeah we're way more interested in
finding like the good algorithm
finding like the good algorithm
generally to use
everywhere then we are in trying to like
everywhere then we are in trying to like
provide a repository of existing
provide a repository of existing
algorithms that you have to try all of
them and so far we're based on PO CU
them and so far we're based on PO CU
that's simple it works very well U
that's simple it works very well U
doesn't mean it will always be the case
doesn't mean it will always be the case
we might just we might just need some
we might just we might just need some
small modifications to PO we might need
small modifications to PO we might need
to do something completely different
to do something completely different
we'll see but so far this has been
we'll see but so far this has been
good and you know po does have precedent
good and you know po does have precedent
of solving very hard
problems okay so all this is technically
problems okay so all this is technically
just to fix up the
just to fix up the
data so if we forgive
data so if we forgive
this and there's some stuff to forgive
this and there's some stuff to forgive
here because this is 1200 freaking lines
here because this is 1200 freaking lines
of code
of code
this is 6 700 lines of
code
HC okay this is my code so I don't have
HC okay this is my code so I don't have
to read this and this is like kind of
to read this and this is like kind of
portions of my code I think mixed
with mix with the original massive
with mix with the original massive
code yeah so like this is the
original but he cleaned it up at least
original but he cleaned it up at least
so this is no longer calling like
so this is no longer calling like
super and stuff
but like I see so he's cleaned it up
but like I see so he's cleaned it up
he's kind of like unnested all the
he's kind of like unnested all the
horrible functions that were being used
horrible functions that were being used
in a way but he hasn't understood
in a way but he hasn't understood
why the functions were there in the
why the functions were there in the
first place because like the only reason
first place because like the only reason
to have these three separate functions
to have these three separate functions
uh is because of all the horrible
uh is because of all the horrible
inheritance that was being done before
inheritance that was being done before
you can just put the code here or you
you can just put the code here or you
can make it one function
can make it one function
like there's no reason to have a pre a
like there's no reason to have a pre a
physic step and a post
physic step and a post
now your functions are allowed to be
long okay this is new
I remember this
code J Puff
code J Puff
spaces so we just added this in here and
spaces so we just added this in here and
kept all of
this I mean I'd rather just this be
this I mean I'd rather just this be
hardcoded because it's already hardcoded
hardcoded because it's already hardcoded
to the base model so like this is
redundant okay so this is where you use
redundant okay so this is where you use
motion Leb
at least this looks like it's easier to
at least this looks like it's easier to
work with though
yeah okay
y I read this
y I read this
before okay so I think I sort of have an
before okay so I think I sort of have an
idea of
idea of
what happened
here and then I okay so I have an idea
here and then I okay so I have an idea
of what happened here at least
of what happened here at least
cool let's go from here to back to the
cool let's go from here to back to the
cool hyperparameter tuning stuff at
cool hyperparameter tuning stuff at
least until kyung is up so to give a
least until kyung is up so to give a
brief overview of what I was doing in uh
brief overview of what I was doing in uh
hyper parameter sweeping stuff I think
hyper parameter sweeping stuff I think
this is the most important thing I can
this is the most important thing I can
work on in reinforcement learning right
work on in reinforcement learning right
now because if you get this right the
now because if you get this right the
entire cost of running RL experiments
entire cost of running RL experiments
drops by probably a factor of anywhere
drops by probably a factor of anywhere
from 2 to
from 2 to
um and also you get to be way more
um and also you get to be way more
confident in the outcome of your
confident in the outcome of your
experiments just weigh higher confidence
experiments just weigh higher confidence
science which is always
science which is always
good so this paper right this is based
good so this paper right this is based
on Pito
on Pito
optimality uses basian optimization the
optimality uses basian optimization the
goal is to discover the front of Pito
goal is to discover the front of Pito
optimal points that is the set of points
optimal points that is the set of points
uh the set of hyperparameters the set of
uh the set of hyperparameters the set of
experiments for which you can't find to
experiments for which you can't find to
be a set of hyper parameters that will
be a set of hyper parameters that will
be both faster and higher scoring than
be both faster and higher scoring than
than what I have now that is the high
than what I have now that is the high
level of it um to do that there is a
level of it um to do that there is a
very simple base algorithm uh the simple
very simple base algorithm uh the simple
the very simple version of the algorithm
the very simple version of the algorithm
is that you take some random samples you
is that you take some random samples you
find which points are parito optimal so
find which points are parito optimal so
which points are on that curve I can
which points are on that curve I can
draw it real quick
so if this is if you have some points
so if this is if you have some points
like
this if you have some points like this
this if you have some points like this
then the Pito points the Pito front is
then the Pito points the Pito front is
like this right these are the points
like this right these are the points
that are Pito optimal because there's
that are Pito optimal because there's
nothing to the up and right there's
nothing to the up and right there's
nothing over
nothing over
here um so what you can do is you can
here um so what you can do is you can
randomly sample some data let's say
randomly sample some data let's say
these points come from random samples
these points come from random samples
then what you do is you start looking
then what you do is you start looking
around these
around these
points you start looking around in
points you start looking around in
hyperparameter space and then you try to
hyperparameter space and then you try to
put points here here here here and here
put points here here here here and here
so on and then uh you can do this just
so on and then uh you can do this just
by randomly sampling experiments like
by randomly sampling experiments like
randomly sampling around these points
randomly sampling around these points
but uh you can also do a whole bunch of
but uh you can also do a whole bunch of
math and try do
better I will put the current math on
better I will put the current math on
screen we have made some changes to this
screen we have made some changes to this
since
since
um we've made some major changes to this
right and I believe that we had
Neil V to no mean
Neil V to no mean
okay viiz Pi M
okay viiz Pi M
V2 this was the experiment that we
V2 this was the experiment that we
started on
started on
last
time this somewhere and then
okay so this is what we got from
yesterday let me look at
yesterday let me look at
this there's quite a lot of math I'm
this there's quite a lot of math I'm
keeping in my head at the moment but I
keeping in my head at the moment but I
will try to talk through my thoughts in
will try to talk through my thoughts in
a way that they're at least somewhat
a way that they're at least somewhat
intelligible
um where is the
um where is the
here it
here it
is normalized for mean minus norest
is normalized for mean minus norest
normalized nearest burito
score I would not expect this to produce
score I would not expect this to produce
that Gra
you should get something uniform along
you should get something uniform along
this line from this function um I think
this line from this function um I think
what's Happening Here is it's the way
what's Happening Here is it's the way
the score is being
normalized normalize for me normalized
normalized normalize for me normalized
nearest parito
score okay this
score okay this
Isen to be able to connect
me that's the thing nobody who I know
me that's the thing nobody who I know
who is in my circle would do that they'd
who is in my circle would do that they'd
look at me like I'm nuts right they they
look at me like I'm nuts right they they
would literally like they'd probably try
would literally like they'd probably try
to like email me and tell me that my

Discord account or whatever I message

them on got

hacked do you see what I
mean that's the problem that you've got
mean that's the problem that you've got
to fix is right now you can you can only
to fix is right now you can you can only
like do this with people who are already

I don't know it's more basic like
I don't know it's more basic like
business than it is Tech and
business than it is Tech and
uh I uh I took some like some classes at
uh I uh I took some like some classes at
uh the business school while I was at
uh the business school while I was at
MIT and I realized that it's you know
MIT and I realized that it's you know
it's way way easier as a tech person to
it's way way easier as a tech person to
just get some of those business skills
just get some of those business skills
than it is vice versa it's very very
than it is vice versa it's very very
simple stuff
simple stuff
right it's like person you're talking to
right it's like person you're talking to
cares about Hardware or AI or something
cares about Hardware or AI or something
that's not crypto you're trying to sell
that's not crypto you're trying to sell
them because it's crypto they don't care
them because it's crypto they don't care
right they think that you're like that
right they think that you're like that
your thing is a
your thing is a
scam you demonstrate value you try to
scam you demonstrate value you try to
like you work to push out some of the
like you work to push out some of the
grifters or at least minimize their
grifters or at least minimize their
impact you say hey this can do X Y and Z
impact you say hey this can do X Y and Z
for you people are happy it's very
for you people are happy it's very
simple
right you can give me plenty of examp
right you can give me plenty of examp
examples but the thing is like these are
examples but the thing is like these are
just going to be considered outliers
just going to be considered outliers
until you shift the whole mass of it
until you shift the whole mass of it
better
right like yeah look if I were clever
right like yeah look if I were clever
right if I were if I'm a clever person
right if I were if I'm a clever person
and I cared about crypto and I wanted to
and I cared about crypto and I wanted to
fund something using crypto I could
fund something using crypto I could
probably come up with some cool way to
probably come up with some cool way to
basically allow people to invest in a
basically allow people to invest in a
company without having to be subject to
company without having to be subject to
the regulations uh the normal
the regulations uh the normal
regulations via crypto while still being
regulations via crypto while still being
legal that's basically what you could do
legal that's basically what you could do
with it
with it
um
um
right it's like you're you can IPO
right it's like you're you can IPO
without iping and potentially with more
without iping and potentially with more
favorable
terms and you can IPO on day
terms and you can IPO on day
one um
at least until the government catches up
at least until the government catches up
and decides to come up with some way
and decides to come up with some way
that you can't do
that I'm on your side
that I'm on your side
there you got to get the damn grifters
out e
I think I need the inverse of this
I think I need the inverse of this
function I think that's what it comes
function I think that's what it comes
down to is I need to be able to undo the
down to is I need to be able to undo the
Quant transform
here but I don't really want to have to
here but I don't really want to have to
undo the quantal
transform send you
majority that doesn't make a difference
majority that doesn't make a difference
that's still being affiliated with it
but the thing is you again it's like I'm
but the thing is you again it's like I'm
doing legit Tech work here people see
doing legit Tech work here people see
that I'm not going to compromise that by
that I'm not going to compromise that by
stepping into a space that's just filled
stepping into a space that's just filled
with grifters and
charlatans you
see even if there were some upside like
see even if there were some upside like
some substantial upside I'd have to
some substantial upside I'd have to
balance it against that
like there simply isn't a compelling
like there simply isn't a compelling
argument
hey welcome
I'm not doing nothing at the moment by
I'm not doing nothing at the moment by
the way I'm still thinking through
the way I'm still thinking through
this
this
um so I mean what's happening at the
um so I mean what's happening at the
moment as far as I can tell with
moment as far as I can tell with
this this where is
it this here is the difference between
it this here is the difference between
the score of this like of a point say
the score of this like of a point say
this point here and the score of the
this point here and the score of the
nearest Paro
nearest Paro
point so it's this vertical distance
point so it's this vertical distance
except that it's normalized by a
except that it's normalized by a
quantile
quantile
transform
so oh I think I see what's happening
the only agreement that you're going to
the only agreement that you're going to
get out of me right is that you could
get out of me right is that you could
have a really good vehicle in fact the
have a really good vehicle in fact the
vehicle of getting like Community
vehicle of getting like Community
crowdsource like projects decentralized
crowdsource like projects decentralized
projects open source Dev off the ground
projects open source Dev off the ground
and running and well funded without all
and running and well funded without all
the normal strings of VC you could have
the normal strings of VC you could have
something really good there but it's not
something really good there but it's not
there at the moment
here let me let me tell you what this
here let me let me tell you what this
would be like right this would be like
would be like right this would be like
if instead of Hosting uh puffer
if instead of Hosting uh puffer
discussions and stuff on Discord what if
discussions and stuff on Discord what if
I hosted all of the all of the
I hosted all of the all of the
communications on ham if that's even
communications on ham if that's even
still
still
around what would the reception be to
that that's about the quality of the
that that's about the quality of the
brand that you have
brand that you have
behind behind new tokens
wel come
back so hopefully this is useful
back so hopefully this is useful
information assuming that you you know
information assuming that you you know
you're not just purely trying to
you're not just purely trying to
convince me of this and you are looking
convince me of this and you are looking
for that
I mean the whole meme coin shitcoin
I mean the whole meme coin shitcoin
pump. fun thing is not helping you know
pump. fun thing is not helping you know
if this is your objective like even the
if this is your objective like even the
existance and the prevalence of this is
existance and the prevalence of this is
not helping
I don't know the particular reason by
I don't know the particular reason by
the way for um the dev ecosystem being
the way for um the dev ecosystem being
around Solana maybe there is a a
around Solana maybe there is a a
technical reason for it but as an
technical reason for it but as an
outsider if I were trying to actually do
outsider if I were trying to actually do
that right if I were trying to actually
that right if I were trying to actually
make that happen I would distance myself
make that happen I would distance myself
as much as possible from the existing
as much as possible from the existing
mess I'd probably do it on bitcoin or
mess I'd probably do it on bitcoin or
ethereum probably Bitcoin and you know I
ethereum probably Bitcoin and you know I
would just I would work to push all of
would just I would work to push all of
that side
that side
out
right that's what I would
do how much money there is on versus
do how much money there is on versus
Bitcoin
no
way market cap for meme projects or
way market cap for meme projects or
market cap
total well yes to which
I mean again for all the reasons I've SA
I mean again for all the reasons I've SA
you're not going to get me onto this
you're not going to get me onto this
thing all I can do is tell you how I
thing all I can do is tell you how I
would go about trying to fix the
would go about trying to fix the
ecosystem if I were actually going to
ecosystem if I were actually going to
but like I'm I'm doing AI stuff
right I think I have as well in the
right I think I have as well in the
during this process I think I figured
out I think I figured out what is going
out I think I figured out what is going
on
on
here so so this is a quantile
transform it starts by taking this
transform it starts by taking this
data and
data and
ranking essenti it's almost like a rank
ranking essenti it's almost like a rank
transform uh it just replaces each point
transform uh it just replaces each point
with the percentile it is in the data so
with the percentile it is in the data so
this would be like this is probably like
this would be like this is probably like
20% of the data is down here or 30% and
20% of the data is down here or 30% and
this is maybe
this is maybe
40% uh but then it converts it to a unit
40% uh but then it converts it to a unit
normal so I think that what happens then
normal so I think that what happens then
is the mean is going to be around
is the mean is going to be around
here and then it creates a long tail
here and then it creates a long tail
distribution over here so the distance
distribution over here so the distance
between these two points is actually
between these two points is actually
quite large and the distance between
quite large and the distance between
points over here is quite
points over here is quite
small which is not at all what we want
okay big
okay big
number is that trillion yeah
number is that trillion yeah
wait yeah that's
trillion yeah tiny fraction
again but where's the volume coming
again but where's the volume coming
coming from
you see this quantile
you see this quantile
so I think it's the Earth
so I think it's the Earth
inverse is where we go
wrong but there's still an issue here
wrong but there's still an issue here
right
cost I think we need to use
cost I think we need to use
cost okay I think I see the
cost okay I think I see the
problem I see the
problem I see the
problem okay so here's the issue
problem okay so here's the issue
right for folks I think I've actually
right for folks I think I've actually
figured this out in the meantime
figured this out in the meantime
which so this is the issue
let's say that you have one parito front
let's say that you have one parito front
that looks like
this it's a
this it's a
line this one would be very easy uh to
line this one would be very easy uh to
optimize because what you can do is say
optimize because what you can do is say
hey if I have this existing Point here
hey if I have this existing Point here
and I have this existing Point here and
and I have this existing Point here and
I want to evaluate the quality of this
I want to evaluate the quality of this
point here as a sample
point here as a sample
I just take this distance right I just
I just take this distance right I just
subtract the distance from the nearest
subtract the distance from the nearest
Paro point in height space but the issue
Paro point in height space but the issue
with doing
with doing
this is that you can also have a parito
this is that you can also have a parito
front that looks like
this where it's pretty darn flat towards
this where it's pretty darn flat towards
the top not exactly flat but pretty darn
flat um so if you do
that then you can't do a vertical
that then you can't do a vertical
distance at
all what if you do horizontal distance
all what if you do horizontal distance
instead so if you have a point here you
instead so if you have a point here you
have a point
here it's this
here it's this
distance this point still has to be
distance this point still has to be
better but you can't use the magnitude
better but you can't use the magnitude
of the
Improvement I would consider doing it if
Improvement I would consider doing it if
there were clear value demonstrated and
there were clear value demonstrated and
right now it's clearly negative
it's like why do I host all the stuff in
it's like why do I host all the stuff in
Discord CU Discord is like I is and is
Discord CU Discord is like I is and is
recognized as the clear place to do this
recognized as the clear place to do this
stuff I think this makes me negative
stuff I think this makes me negative
money at the moment
M welcome
M welcome
Captain I think I figured something out
Captain I think I figured something out
on these
on these
sweeps I'm trying to think if there's
sweeps I'm trying to think if there's
anything wrong with
this there
this there
with the way it is currently there's
with the way it is currently there's
like there's no way you're going to
like there's no way you're going to
convince me of this you'd have to change
convince me of this you'd have to change
the
ecosystem the only thing you can
ecosystem the only thing you can
convince me is that there's potential if
convince me is that there's potential if
you fix the
ecosystem so the issue is that even uh
ecosystem so the issue is that even uh
so Captain the issue is even with the
so Captain the issue is even with the
quantile transform vertical distance
quantile transform vertical distance
doesn't give you what you want so this
doesn't give you what you want so this
is without a cost penalty and I think
is without a cost penalty and I think
what's happened here so you do the
what's happened here so you do the
quantal transform right and then you
quantal transform right and then you
pull it into normalized
pull it into normalized
space so it's uniform normal and then
space so it's uniform normal and then
what happens is like the mean is right
what happens is like the mean is right
here and that means that uh the gaussian
here and that means that uh the gaussian
has the long tails out this way and this
has the long tails out this way and this
way so the distance between these like
way so the distance between these like
these close little points here in this
these close little points here in this
normalized space is very large and the
normalized space is very large and the
same over here here so you end up
same over here here so you end up
getting just a ton of samples over here
getting just a ton of samples over here
and it will very slowly creep towards
and it will very slowly creep towards
the
the
center is not what you want and if you
center is not what you want and if you
were to undo um the normalization step
were to undo um the normalization step
and just have the quantile transform
and just have the quantile transform
well the quantile transform it just
well the quantile transform it just
gives you a percentage you just get a a
gives you a percentage you just get a a
percentage of the data that you're
percentage of the data that you're
better so here you're better than say
better so here you're better than say
40% of the data and if they're 100
40% of the data and if they're 100
points here you're better than 41 42
points here you're better than 41 42
it's just like a rank transform uh but
it's just like a rank transform uh but
then the distance you see between this
then the distance you see between this
point and this point is only one which
point and this point is only one which
is the same as the distance between this
is the same as the distance between this
point and this point is also one so it
point and this point is also one so it
really doesn't help you uh you still
really doesn't help you uh you still
aren't going to get the effect of
aren't going to get the effect of
filling in the parito front if that's
filling in the parito front if that's
what you
want if I do it based on cost like doing
want if I do it based on cost like doing
it based on cost I think the only way to
it based on cost I think the only way to
actually get the predo front filled
in I mean the only other thing you could
in I mean the only other thing you could
do right is you would have to figure out
do right is you would have to figure out
how to linearize
okay wait hang
okay wait hang
on you now exploring hyper Prem not
on you now exploring hyper Prem not
really the cost space kind of but the
really the cost space kind of but the
thing is they're
linked hang on is there a way to make
linked hang on is there a way to make
this
this
uniform Norm uniform linear
does that work
somehow okay the other thing I could
somehow okay the other thing I could
think of
think of
right is there a way to
right is there a way to
transform the score space to always be
transform the score space to always be
linear
I think I just need to I need to work on
I think I just need to I need to work on
inverting this function because if if I
inverting this function because if if I
invert this function then at the very
invert this function then at the very
least I can test it on
least I can test it on
this because here the score space is
this because here the score space is
legitimately
linear Earth

interested in engaging with with crypto
interested in engaging with with crypto
in any way around my
project the most helpful thing at the
project the most helpful thing at the
moment is just like getting RL like
moment is just like getting RL like
getting more RL people interested in the
getting more RL people interested in the
project and deving environments and
project and deving environments and
stuff
stuff
um that's the main thing
speaking of which Captain if you're
speaking of which Captain if you're
still around we um I should take a look
still around we um I should take a look
at your environment as of late um yeah
at your environment as of late um yeah
there's a bunch more cool science side
there's a bunch more cool science side
stuff to be done
here so hopefully we can get that I can
here so hopefully we can get that I can
take a look and help fix up any issues
take a look and help fix up any issues
with baselines on the on that
with baselines on the on that
environment and get that added pretty
environment and get that added pretty
soon that'd be awesome it's a really
soon that'd be awesome it's a really
cool environment I'd like to at least
cool environment I'd like to at least
throw together a quick Shader or two for
throw together a quick Shader or two for
it just to Jazz it up a bit that' be
fun okay
so take all this
oh
oh
good it gets even faster that's all the
better yeah it just needs to be jazzed
better yeah it just needs to be jazzed
up a little bit
right just so people see it for
what do we think the odds are that this
what do we think the odds are that this
got this correct on the first try not
got this correct on the first try not
even remotely
close oh that's
hilarious it literally just like wrote
hilarious it literally just like wrote
normalized scores and then filled it in
normalized scores and then filled it in
the same exact way that's so
the same exact way that's so
stupid for
squ < TK of two
hold on let me see running into training
hold on let me see running into training
issues with large physics time steps
issues with large physics time steps
physics Delta fairly
large yeah of course that'll happen
large yeah of course that'll happen
right that's how physics
right that's how physics
works you got to balance it you just do
works you got to balance it you just do
the smallest you can get away
with is the ca

that CCD on projectiles though
supposed to solve it
supposed to solve it
how okay I don't know how that
works yeah I know I've been dealing with
works yeah I know I've been dealing with
people bugging me about that for a long
people bugging me about that for a long
time no it's not mine I made a post
time no it's not mine I made a post
about it um I I already made an
about it um I I already made an
announcement it's not
mine okay
okay so you can't undo the

look make an announcement about this
look make an announcement about this

about it whenever the heck they

originally did
it see this is what I mean though I
it see this is what I mean though I
literally have like dozens of
literally have like dozens of
DMs like
DMs like
this and you think I'm going to engage
this and you think I'm going to engage
with this ecosystem at all of course not
I have 2 FAA on it it's fine
TP
this is kind of obnoxious to
undo is this
undo is this
even I don't even this isn't even
even I don't even this isn't even
invertible is
it I think I saw something in the

original code about this as well cuz
original code about this as well cuz
this transform is
this transform is
not I'm pretty darn sure this is not
not I'm pretty darn sure this is not

you're not going to bribe me to
like it's not how it works
when you sleep when the work is done
many many

p.m. Deo it's that I've had a lot a lot
p.m. Deo it's that I've had a lot a lot
of people bugging me about this lately
of people bugging me about this lately

all I've literally have dozens of DMS
all I've literally have dozens of DMS
and I'm just trying to build AI stuff
and I'm just trying to build AI stuff
here
let me
just do this real quick
just going to keep that for records
because that sounded like a
threat e
yeah the thing is he's just going to
yeah the thing is he's just going to
come back on another account I'm
come back on another account I'm
sure I might just work off stream today
sure I might just work off stream today
we'll see
mhm
this is definitely fairly distracting
this is definitely fairly distracting
though I want to get this stuff done you
though I want to get this stuff done you
see okay
see okay
so Target
so I get to
Target how does this have an
inverse I really don't want to have to
inverse I really don't want to have to
use this stupid
thing e
back projection to original
space transform
okay so this is just it
and I do not like the this
transform I really don't like this
transform I really don't like this
function that they're using it's kind of
function that they're using it's kind of
a
mess is there something else I could do
mess is there something else I could do
with it let me
with it let me
think than here
and they Clause it to match
uniform I mean it's like a thing that
uniform I mean it's like a thing that
makes sense to do but
let me see I might be able to replace
let me see I might be able to replace
this with something simpler because I
this with something simpler because I
really do not like the uh the added
really do not like the uh the added
complexity from
this no did not launch that's
this no did not launch that's
fake there is no launch
um let me
[Applause]
see nope
this is an AI project
go find how I have this at the moment
oops WR
one I'm just going to ban all the new
one I'm just going to ban all the new
alt accounts as they come in
alt accounts as they come in
that's
stupid got nothing better to do all
stupid got nothing better to do all
right all day okay man it's your life
right all day okay man it's your life
not

you're interested in contributing join
you're interested in contributing join

start guide
start guide
here and start by building a just a
here and start by building a just a
really basic RL environment to get a
really basic RL environment to get a
sense of how things work especially if
sense of how things work especially if
you come in without an RL background
yeah I don't know why they're
doing e
why did they
specifically there was a comment in
specifically there was a comment in
there
right using preserves more distance
right using preserves more distance
information within the quantiles
you know at this point I almost don't
you know at this point I almost don't
care if this thing works better it's
care if this thing works better it's
just like it's complex there's no
just like it's complex there's no
intuition behind this I don't see how it
intuition behind this I don't see how it
fits here and I want it out of the code
fits here and I want it out of the code
base
base
um yeah let me I we can just run a quick
um yeah let me I we can just run a quick
experiment as well to
see so get rid of
see so get rid of
this for
let me real
quick
e e
go fig we do
that what's this function rank
data oops
what did I
what did I
use I used
use I used
quantile yeah I don't need quantile I
quantile yeah I don't need quantile I
just
need divided
by yeah that's fine the plus one is
fine s pile
course nor score
okay
mod
for e
is is this going to produce dramatically
is is this going to produce dramatically
different
behavior that would also be
interesting h
there anything else wrong
there anything else wrong
here normalize
near and know this is fine whatever I
near and know this is fine whatever I
get up whatever I apply to this will be
get up whatever I apply to this will be
applied to the parito front so I'll just
applied to the parito front so I'll just
have to wait and
have to wait and
see how this
see how this
uh how this thing explores outward
oh the thing is that this is still a
oh the thing is that this is still a
gaussian
so it should push to the
extremities we will see doesn't seem
extremities we will see doesn't seem
like it's really doing that
like it's really doing that
yet but um
here let's just prepare
here let's just prepare
this
so e
okay so this thing is pushing up in cost
okay so this thing is pushing up in cost
so that's something at least and then
so that's something at least and then
we'll see what happens when we
we'll see what happens when we
unnormalized
it
e for
got up to
40s well I think that because of the
40s well I think that because of the
rank transform
there's not a huge amount of
there's not a huge amount of
differentiation between the points at
differentiation between the points at
the very end
right yeah there's not a huge amount of
right yeah there's not a huge amount of
differ okay so that that's a
differ okay so that that's a
problem can I
somehow well I have to undo the
somehow well I have to undo the
percentile don't I
see this just gets us back to
percentile this just gets us to
percentile this just gets us to
percentile and then we have to
unnormalized believe we have to
unnormalized believe we have to
unnormalized
thank you just calling
turp for
yeah let's see what this gives
us so this is not
us so this is not
good but the other one wasn't good it
good but the other one wasn't good it
was just bad in a different
way uh that's
terrible really don't like that
I should they have to
be oh no that's kind of gross
actually so this is obnoxious because I
actually so this is obnoxious because I
think you
think you
need I think you do need the rank
transform I'm pretty sure you do need
transform I'm pretty sure you do need
the rank
the rank
transform let me explain what's going on
transform let me explain what's going on
here
here
right oh wait wait wait hold
right oh wait wait wait hold
on we can test it we can test it without
on we can test it we can test it without
the rank
the rank
transform because I have linear data in
transform because I have linear data in
this test okay let me try this and then
this test okay let me try this and then
I'll explain this at least should let us
I'll explain this at least should let us
construct a reasonable test and then
construct a reasonable test and then
we'll see if this is worth dealing with
okay
so here's the
so here's the
idea uh we were doing this
prematurely so if you have something
prematurely so if you have something
that looks like this you cannot rely on
that looks like this you cannot rely on
the magnitude on the Y AIS the score of
the magnitude on the Y AIS the score of
these points for really
these points for really
anything cuz the Paro front can have so
anything cuz the Paro front can have so
many different
many different
shapes but because we have linear data
shapes but because we have linear data
for this test test and we know it is
for this test test and we know it is
linear data we should be able to skip
linear data we should be able to skip
the rank transform now when I tested
the rank transform now when I tested
this previously I forgot to uh convert
this previously I forgot to uh convert
the data to standard normal so that'll
the data to standard normal so that'll
mess it up but now what I have is data
mess it up but now what I have is data
gets converted to standard
gets converted to standard
normal prediction happens in standard
normal prediction happens in standard
normal space which is what you want for
normal space which is what you want for
Gan
Gan
process and then the unnormalized is
process and then the unnormalized is
very simple because we didn't have to
very simple because we didn't have to
deal with the rank
deal with the rank
transform uh and then what this should
transform uh and then what this should
let us do is test the algorithm nicely
let us do is test the algorithm nicely
on linear data and actually get some
on linear data and actually get some
reasonable
reasonable
results and then we can decide what data
results and then we can decide what data
transform needs to be applied to handle
transform needs to be applied to handle
uh different score
uh different score
distributions right
oh is this doing what I think it
oh is this doing what I think it
is this is
hilarious it's like laddering its way
hilarious it's like laddering its way
down actually
if this is actually what it's doing it's
if this is actually what it's doing it's
too smart for its own
good I'm looking at it and that's what
good I'm looking at it and that's what
it's
doing I guess that would make
sense okay we're gonna let this finish
sense okay we're gonna let this finish
and then I'll explain I'll explain what
and then I'll explain I'll explain what
I think it's
done that's
done that's
hilarious I think it's literally
hilarious I think it's literally
gotten the algorithm is too good for
gotten the algorithm is too good for
it's too smart for its own good
it's too smart for its own good
here it found a way to cheat my
here it found a way to cheat my
objective yeah so the rank transform was
objective yeah so the rank transform was
just screwing everything up I
think and now it's going to something
think and now it's going to something
more
more
reasonable I didn't see like a bunch of
reasonable I didn't see like a bunch of
50s ever did I oh no they're 50s it
50s ever did I oh no they're 50s it
still should fill in uh there's some
still should fill in uh there's some
other regions that should fill in though
do you see that most most of the points
do you see that most most of the points
are slowly working their way down 113
are slowly working their way down 113
111 it's got a very accurate cost model
111 it's got a very accurate cost model
as well so it's very good at doing
this and then there are some other ones
this and then there are some other ones
it looks like it's also working its way
it looks like it's also working its way
down from
down from
82 it's working its way down from
82 it's working its way down from
multiple points
simultaneously don't know about that
180 this is going to be a crazy looking
180 this is going to be a crazy looking
graph
the funny thing is I can't even be mad
the funny thing is I can't even be mad
because this
is is this a straight A straight screw
is is this a straight A straight screw
up in my
original no it's a property of the cost
original no it's a property of the cost
actually in this
actually in this
case
case
interesting it all comes down to the
interesting it all comes down to the
scaling of the cost and the score if you
scaling of the cost and the score if you
have these things to these two things
have these things to these two things
scaled correctly it should
work I'm actually tempted to now try
work I'm actually tempted to now try
this on the log cost
problem e
so
so
funny so what's happened here I'm pretty
funny so what's happened here I'm pretty
confident at this
confident at this
point is I specified the
point is I specified the
reward for this
reward for this
experiment as the
experiment as the
improvement over the next lowest cost
improvement over the next lowest cost
Paro point so what it's done done here
Paro point so what it's done done here
is it's gotten some random samples that
is it's gotten some random samples that
are very high cost and then there are
are very high cost and then there are
some other points that are Paro points
some other points that are Paro points
that are like way to the left and it's
that are like way to the left and it's
just going a little tiny bit to the left
just going a little tiny bit to the left
and getting the full reward and going a
and getting the full reward and going a
little bit to the left of that one and
little bit to the left of that one and
getting the full reward and it's just
getting the full reward and it's just
repeating that
continuously so it's like lading its way
continuously so it's like lading its way
down from the top
yeah look at
this that's one heck of a crazy
graph it started up here and it worked
graph it started up here and it worked
its way down it started up here and it
its way down it started up here and it
worked its way down it started up here
worked its way down it started up here
and it worked its way
down so technically this is one of the
down so technically this is one of the
better results that we've gotten in
better results that we've gotten in
terms of coverage but um it's still
terms of coverage but um it's still
clearly not working the way we want
clearly not working the way we want
right it's making these little tiny
right it's making these little tiny
jumps instead of trying to actively
jumps instead of trying to actively
cover the Paro front
are you kidding
me freaking messing with my Discord now
me freaking messing with my Discord now
[ __ ]
[ __ ]
off
e e
real
quick
e
e e
just fixing a couple
things e
okay
okay
so back to
this if the increment is divided by the
this if the increment is divided by the
cost
it's still not going to fix it
right e
okay I think I just need to think to
okay I think I just need to think to
reformulate this objective a little bit
reformulate this objective a little bit
because the penalty term that I
because the penalty term that I
introduced will definitely cause this
introduced will definitely cause this
every
time
e e
the thing is I don't want to explicit L
the thing is I don't want to explicit L
have a term that tells you to spread out
have a term that tells you to spread out
in CL spr space do
I maybe I
do for
you want to fill out the Paro front
okay hang on
thing is I think that even difference in
thing is I think that even difference in
rank could be really unstable
right e
I think they're like they two
I think they're like they two
competing issues here
okay what if for now I just think about
okay what if for now I just think about
this instance I sto trying to think
this instance I sto trying to think
about the harder ones in my head at the
about the harder ones in my head at the
same
time performance increment
by
cost distance to nearest
Point performance divided by distance to
Point performance divided by distance to
nearest burrito point
that loses the notion of though of
capturing you really just want the
capturing you really just want the
divisor term to have
divisor term to have
cost be performance per
cost no that's fine the top thing can
cost no that's fine the top thing can
have a divisor as
well it's like Information
Gain
e e
technically the algorithm would work as
technically the algorithm would work as
is if
um no it really would never work as
is yeah
okay pretty much the only way you're
okay pretty much the only way you're
ever going to
ever going to
get a filled in parito front is by
get a filled in parito front is by
explicitly having a cost term I think we
explicitly having a cost term I think we
should accept
should accept
that
so let me try
so let me try
something
for
e
e e
okay so
here got this distance
lost
mean Jus
scores this is just going to
be for now
this do what I
want yeah so
score
score
no times right
score times distance to nearest
burrito we'll see what this does I have
burrito we'll see what this does I have
no idea
what happened here
uh uh
PE
for for
can't I just do this
yeah that looks good hopefully I did it
yeah that looks good hopefully I did it
right
okay these predictions suck so I messed
okay these predictions suck so I messed
something up
it just took a
it just took a
while was
weird okay there's definitely a weird
weird okay there's definitely a weird
boundary
boundary
issue we'll let that run for a bit
nearby I'm going to go use the restroom
nearby I'm going to go use the restroom
I'll be
I'll be
back um I got to do a couple other quick
back um I got to do a couple other quick
things I'll be back this will run we'll
things I'll be back this will run we'll
continue on this for a bit at
least
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e
e e
okay
oops cool I got some replies back
so let's see what this
is and I'm going to actually I'm going
is and I'm going to actually I'm going
to keep this one as
to keep this one as
well okay so this actually gives
well okay so this actually gives
us pretty darn even coverage
right
right
these I don't know what these
these I don't know what these
are uh we can look at that there a
are uh we can look at that there a
couple of these like
couple of these like
columns this one's the one that doesn't
columns this one's the one that doesn't
make sense to me right here
a couple of these columns
a couple of these columns
here but generally this is pretty nicely
spread hey
Ryan how's it going
man we're currently doing very weird
man we're currently doing very weird
hyper Prem op
things I got one that like selects
things I got one that like selects
points and then tries to slowly drip
points and then tries to slowly drip
down and
down and
cost did you see the new
cost did you see the new
mazm it's pretty
mazm it's pretty
cool I have it I posted it on
here doors well I wasn't going to put
here doors well I wasn't going to put
doors in The Mazes right I have a mini
doors in The Mazes right I have a mini
grid thing
though actually I can just do
so here's the initial maze
right here's your initial maze this is
right here's your initial maze this is
tiny
one you can just
dos for
thank you might have seen
this this like mini grid style
this this like mini grid style
task we have to get this key to open
task we have to get this key to open
this door
we have a few
things I'm very very fast as
things I'm very very fast as
well
well
so I figur this is going to be puffer is
so I figur this is going to be puffer is
going to be doing some exploration and
going to be doing some exploration and
possibly curriculum stuff rather soon uh
possibly curriculum stuff rather soon uh
so yeah there's going to be
so yeah there's going to be
uh there going to be some things around
uh there going to be some things around
that also I should go check on uh
oops I might have a
uh okay I got to go uh I might have a
uh okay I got to go uh I might have a
random meetings on the books I will be
