good docker's almost set up
we'll see if any of the uh the GPU Drive

I added support for this thing like I
I added support for this thing like I
don't know two days after it

and then I kind of realized that maybe
and then I kind of realized that maybe
what I did
what I did
might have broken it like just a week or
might have broken it like just a week or
so ago and then the GPU Drive folks told
