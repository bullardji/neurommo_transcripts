okay should be live
here I have to mess with this cut off
here I have to mess with this cut off
later actually can I just real
later actually can I just real
quick
quick
nope let's see do I have H no I don't
nope let's see do I have H no I don't
have any margin on this all right I'll
have any margin on this all right I'll
fuss with the green screen
fuss with the green screen
later oops
we'll keep this for
now we're back
now we're back
though see how far I can pull this
though see how far I can pull this
before it gets in the
before it gets in the
shot there we go um
cool I got a chair upgrade
Xander love the reskin never would have
Xander love the reskin never would have
figured out the permute thing yep very
figured out the permute thing yep very
very common screw up I knew to look for
very common screw up I knew to look for
it because I've debugged this exact
it because I've debugged this exact
thing probably at least 100
times value for out of
bounds it's fine the way you did
it try to replacing nor
normal
but one of my
but one of my
yep pretty much that
yep pretty much that
uh create channel for stream discussions
here first Pac-Man
policy look at
policy look at
that doesn't look
optimal yeah definitely not optimal
passible
passible
though oh it does
backrack not optimal but
decent give you a puffer for
decent give you a puffer for
that BL
that BL
blob very
blob very
nice yesterday
assuming
uh problem with normal is that it
uh problem with normal is that it
assumes single modal
eat you
new M here is going
new M here is going
well so
well so
uh I guess what do we do here we look
uh I guess what do we do here we look
at Xander m a little bit or we look at
at Xander m a little bit or we look at
bets M I'm trying to
bets M I'm trying to
think let's look what PRS we've got open
think let's look what PRS we've got open
I have a ton of time now I kind of just
I have a ton of time now I kind of just
wanted to test out this uh this new
wanted to test out this uh this new
setup to see see if I like this chair
setup to see see if I like this chair
here for my desk I'm sitting down a
here for my desk I'm sitting down a
little bit
little bit
low well that's
fine uh what am I
fine uh what am I
doing welcome YouTube
folks so we've
folks so we've
got code ball
no other PRS open or
no other PRS open or
environments so I think what we do is we
environments so I think what we do is we
play with Xander end and uh we get this
play with Xander end and uh we get this
to a spot that we're happy
to a spot that we're happy
with this a cab
with this a cab
car Let's uh let's get to some
code see a message about action clipping
code see a message about action clipping
offer should
offer should
support for continuous
M
oh e
see Xander
stuff I think what we'll
do h
I'm trying to
think I could use a standard network if
think I could use a standard network if
I just took one small obnoxious thing
I just took one small obnoxious thing
out of his observation
space but then it wouldn't be able to
space but then it wouldn't be able to
tell if it's carrying anything
anything
37 unclip should be
I'm trying to think what I want to do
I'm trying to think what I want to do
with Xander's
with Xander's
policy cuz
like I almost just want to mess with it
like I almost just want to mess with it
and like
and like
add add a
channel
channel
right yeah cuz it's kind of slow as
right yeah cuz it's kind of slow as
well I don't know how much time I have
well I don't know how much time I have
to screw with it at the moment but we'll
to screw with it at the moment but we'll
try some
stuff we're going to get rid of this one
stuff we're going to get rid of this one
plus
plus
um this goes to
uh times five I
uh times five I
believe is that how we do
this uh no interestingly
enough how's the policy work in
enough how's the policy work in
this make linear lstm
oh I forgot I don't have a conf policy
oh I forgot I don't have a conf policy
for
this yeah that's
funny so I guess we can leave
funny so I guess we can leave
it we could leave it like this for now
it we could leave it like this for now
and just
and just
do I'm five this would be pretty easy to
do I'm five this would be pretty easy to
to update as
to update as
well um observation space should not be
float we'll mess with that later though
float we'll mess with that later though
I think this is a major
I think this is a major
issue this is using like way too much
data so let's mess with this now
data so let's mess with this now
actually
the thing that's bothering me is
like so the thing that's bothering me is
like so the thing that's bothering me is
that you technically don't want to one
that you technically don't want to one
hot it in the environment you want to
hot it in the environment you want to
one hot it in the
one hot it in the
policy it's a
policy it's a
nitpick it does have implications for
nitpick it does have implications for
bandwidth
so I think we'll do this for
now and then we'll do
now and then we'll do
compute observations
right num cell types is
four for
we'll try this I just wanted to add a
we'll try this I just wanted to add a
carrying Channel
this might be enough
already let's see if this
already let's see if this
works okay so that does build we need to
works okay so that does build we need to
change the
change the
observations this is char
are oh it's unsigned
okay and then the only thing we got to
okay and then the only thing we got to
do is
do is
OBS they're no longer
floats I could actually you know what I
floats I could actually you know what I
could do is I could make it a signed
Char yeah maybe we'll make it a signed
Char yeah maybe we'll make it a signed
char
there we
go now it'll allow us to keep the
go now it'll allow us to keep the
negative
ones whether that's a good idea I don't
know1 okay so it's on 1 0 negative 1
know1 okay so it's on 1 0 negative 1
this is actually
this is actually
fine totally
fine all I have to do is I changed this
fine all I have to do is I changed this
from uate to
in8 this is
Char this is going to be
Char oh wait
yeah it is Char is signed yes
yeah it is Char is signed yes
right I think I'm
right I think I'm
fine we'll see shortly but I think I'm
fine we'll see shortly but I think I'm
correct
here we have to update the network as
here we have to update the network as
well
I think it's literally this network
I think it's literally this network
right here isn't
right here isn't
it oh look uh this has one hot in it
so let's try
so let's try
this this is five
this this is five
pannels and this is Yep this is
good uh we do not need to one hot this
I do need to go get this line that I
I do need to go get this line that I
wrote
before it's going to be right
here we no longer need this
andom channels
andom channels
it's going to be
five
remute no longer need one
remute no longer need one
hot return the
hot return the
network
network
cool I believe I can get rid of
cool I believe I can get rid of
this whole thing
now obviously I'm not going to push this
now obviously I'm not going to push this
without uh seeing if it works just as
without uh seeing if it works just as
well if not
well if not
better I bet we will be able to get this
better I bet we will be able to get this
thing working
cleanly inputs
cleanly inputs
type
type
yes that is
yes that is
fair
Flo okay so it's already faster
let's see if it
learns and uh I think that
while I forgot
while I forgot
track let's do that
track let's do that
track uh while I wait for this I think
track uh while I wait for this I think
we'll go get our puffer friend
back there he
back there he
is

transform you can go right over
transform you can go right over
here
chat yeah
we
go I thought I had a better version of
go I thought I had a better version of
him um this one has like a little
him um this one has like a little
artifacting but we'll leave him for
now how's this
now how's this
doing hard to say so
far we'll wait to see if it takes off
if not we'll have to do some data
if not we'll have to do some data
examination the M also appears to have
examination the M also appears to have
some speed issues we will look into
some speed issues we will look into
those and just about everything else
those and just about everything else
that we need to do
today I'd like to get a network and C
today I'd like to get a network and C
deployed to this so we can put this onto
deployed to this so we can put this onto
the
the
website that would be
website that would be
ideal episode return is way
ideal episode return is way
higher uh which is
weird possibly something happening
I thought this one right here
was this is the 100 one right here
was this is the 100 one right here
right why is the episode return so
low we'll let that run and then we'll
low we'll let that run and then we'll
see what I could have possibly changed
this episode reward
this episode reward
looks actually looks correct to me it
looks actually looks correct to me it
looks like it was wrong
looks like it was wrong
before but now it doesn't appear to
before but now it doesn't appear to
train when it did train
train when it did train
before
H is it increasing it is actually
H is it increasing it is actually
increasing though which is
increasing though which is
odd you see it's got this like steady
odd you see it's got this like steady
increase to
it looks
too well I could just that could be the
too well I could just that could be the
observations totally being messed up
observations totally being messed up
though let me
see so here I did
cell types is
four and then this is the fifth one
four and then this is the fifth one
right ooh hold
on plus one I think this is missing a
on plus one I think this is missing a
plus
one um the reason I caught that is
uh it's common like if you mess with the
uh it's common like if you mess with the
observation bases to just be writing
observation bases to just be writing
data in the wrong
data in the wrong
spot so I think there that was like
spot so I think there that was like
misaligning the
bites welcome YouTube
folks if we can get a uh a nice clean
folks if we can get a uh a nice clean
policy trained on this then what I will
policy trained on this then what I will
do is I will Port it to see and then
do is I will Port it to see and then
upload it to the website so we can
upload it to the website so we can
actually see this thing
online okay so immediately this is run
online okay so immediately this is run
is way
better how think Xander's going to
better how think Xander's going to
be it's like yeah this is this is what
be it's like yeah this is this is what
you can just do with your
en R
instantly this is actually even slower
instantly this is actually even slower
than I think it should be I think it'll
than I think it should be I think it'll
be way better after hyper pram sweep
interestingly it seems to be fluctuating
interestingly it seems to be fluctuating
a
a
bit that could totally just be hyper
bit that could totally just be hyper
prams
prams
though yeah there we go
h
curious how it's going to uh the end
curious how it's going to uh the end
behavior if it's going to actually
behavior if it's going to actually
get the near 20 or if it's going to
get the near 20 or if it's going to
fiddle out around
fiddle out around
here I can always just increase the
here I can always just increase the
episode length by like 20 steps
if it gets
stuck Xander will be happy with this
stuck Xander will be happy with this
either
way does seem to be fluctuating a fair
way does seem to be fluctuating a fair
bit looking at the episode length
bit looking at the episode length
I think it doesn't have enough time to
I think it doesn't have enough time to
solve the task not
solve the task not
consistently you can see so I'm going to
consistently you can see so I'm going to
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
kill this
and I'm going to do Max steps to 150
here and you can see it's working it's
here and you can see it's working it's
like it's up to the 19 here just it's
like it's up to the 19 here just it's
it's fiddly around here cuz like oh is
it's fiddly around here cuz like oh is
it figuring it
out I can't
out I can't
tell let's kill this and then for
tell let's kill this and then for
comparison we'll run
um 200 mil
um 200 mil
steps 50 mil steps even
16 I bet this works
better this policy should be
better this policy should be
substantially easier to port to see as
substantially easier to port to see as
well this is just a comell
well this is just a comell
STM which I believe we have we have com
STM which I believe we have we have com
valm and puet
yeah we have Comal TM in puffet already
yeah we have Comal TM in puffet already
see so literally
see so literally
um o the data permute though isn't
there yeah so I might have to screw with
there yeah so I might have to screw with
the
data
data
19 and yeah now you can see the episode
19 and yeah now you can see the episode
length is around
length is around
120 um so that's more
120 um so that's more
reasonable it has enough time to
reasonable it has enough time to
complete the
task and I'll be able to even set this
task and I'll be able to even set this
to like 100
Mil for
all right that's solid that's nice and
all right that's solid that's nice and
stable I'm happy with
stable I'm happy with
that uh I will set this config
that uh I will set this config
to uh I think 100 Mil is pretty
to uh I think 100 Mil is pretty
comfortable for this
comfortable for this
task we haven't even done a hyper pram
task we haven't even done a hyper pram
sweep so it'll get better I we'll come
sweep so it'll get better I we'll come
up with like more compelling examples of
up with like more compelling examples of
this as well but hopefully this
this as well but hopefully this
motivates Xander to like try out a few
motivates Xander to like try out a few
more things with this
more things with this
s um I want to mess with the
s um I want to mess with the
permute I'm not happy with the day the
permute I'm not happy with the day the
way the layout of the data is in this
environment yeah cuz hold
environment yeah cuz hold
on let me figure this out so this is
on let me figure this out so this is
important like you want your data to be
important like you want your data to be
in the
in the
format you want your data to be laid out
format you want your data to be laid out
in memory the way that you're going to
in memory the way that you're going to
need the data when you go to use
it so what does this happen What Happens
it so what does this happen What Happens
here
so crop size crop size
so crop size crop size
five. permute
okay so this is Channel's
okay so this is Channel's
last we want channels first technically
last we want channels first technically
Channel's last is actually the better
Channel's last is actually the better
layout for a comp but because puffer net
layout for a comp but because puffer net
matches pie torch we will do it this
way
uh I could also do this in the python
uh I could also do this in the python
layer but like
layer but like
it should be easy
right let me see how it's working
here so
it is kind of a gross way to access
it is kind of a gross way to access
memory I have to move this Loop over
memory I have to move this Loop over
cell
cell
types believe I have to move this to the
outside that's kind of gross
outside that's kind of gross
right cuz you're like filling in one
right cuz you're like filling in one
layer at a
time h
it might not be that
it might not be that
bad let's just do it and then we'll
know
Dy wait
Dy oh yeah no this is super
Dy oh yeah no this is super
gross you have to redo the bounce
checks Xander has it right here it's
checks Xander has it right here it's
just pytorch has it wrong this bothered
just pytorch has it wrong this bothered
me about pytorch for a
me about pytorch for a
while you really want your com dat to be
while you really want your com dat to be
Channel's last formatted
and just do it for now and then we'll
and just do it for now and then we'll
see how bad it
is let's do like
is let's do like
this so we do type
so y so
X if C so what you do is I think we flip
X if C so what you do is I think we flip
this if it's less than
this if it's less than
zero
zero
or this is just basic
or this is just basic
code greater than
equal
or less than
zero and then what we
zero and then what we
do is
do is
OBS plus plus is
OBS plus plus is
-1 and then we do like this continue
otherwise we get the grid
cell
cell
if type was it type
else this entity
one I think this is the same

logic uh we have a very easy way of
logic uh we have a very easy way of
testing that just by compiling it and
testing that just by compiling it and
seeing if it
seeing if it
works I think this is actually slightly
works I think this is actually slightly
worse than Xander's original design
worse than Xander's original design
because this is a less efficient Loop
because this is a less efficient Loop
order but I think it'll still be fast

do do
view now we just laid out correctly in

good looks like it's

copy that you have to do uh for the typ

I think we should just be able to

um do I just have that thing and I've
um do I just have that thing and I've
never used
it
maybe envel
STM just need the signature
we do weights
we do weights
agents input

go okay

forting a model to see
so we take the last

trash pick
trash pick

PT all this does is export the weights
PT all this does is export the weights
to a flat
to a flat

also tells me how big the net is in this
also tells me how big the net is in this
case it is
150 2
150 2
four 2 four five that's the size of the

model and that should
work now the only thing I'm not sure oh
work now the only thing I'm not sure oh
I also have to copy
I also have to copy

interesting let me
say what would have caused that
this is obsc Fu con Fu
this is obsc Fu con Fu
linear pretty sure this is the same
linear pretty sure this is the same
policy I'll go print it out just to be

sure but let me
sure but let me
see inut D input
channels let
channels let
see input d it's 11 and then channnel
see input d it's 11 and then channnel
got five input channels 32 CNN channels
got five input channels 32 CNN channels
128 hidden Dam and
128 hidden Dam and
four it's fine unless
four it's fine unless
uh just change something
uh just change something

[Music]
here nope
yeah there it is
yeah there it is
one 5
32 wait stride
32 wait stride
three that's what I use isn't
it
it
yeah five by five it's tried three
that's
weird it's a real error
65 up foret
let me see where this uh this
fails this say it fails
at right
at right
here well something's definitely wrong
here well something's definitely wrong
with that because it definitely should
with that because it definitely should
not be out of
parameters by
here oh I know what it
here oh I know what it
is don't
is don't
I oh no surprisingly I
I oh no surprisingly I
don't I'm
agents h
maybe hold
on input them
on input them
what channels CNN channels 32 hidden dim
what channels CNN channels 32 hidden dim
is 120 action is 4 now this is
is 120 action is 4 now this is
absolutely
correct I don't know if I ever tested
correct I don't know if I ever tested
this comp to be
fair it is actually 11 by 11 right
see yeah no the input dim is correct
here
here
wait CAC
something's not right
something's not right
here his OBS doesn't have a
channels isn't this time's channels
and what do we do Waits make come to
and what do we do Waits make come to
the D input D input
the D input D input
[Music]
[Music]
channels three
out channels in channels
H
interesting do I use this anywhere
make com
to so no I don't actually use this so
to so no I don't actually use this so
this is
this is
untested so that would make sense why it
untested so that would make sense why it
is not
is not
working
um
yep let me see so
yep let me see so
weights
weights
agents in width in
agents in width in
height in channels out
height in channels out
channels size Trad so this is this call
channels size Trad so this is this call
looks correct so why does this take up
looks correct so why does this take up
so many damn
so many damn
parameters there's what we're going to
parameters there's what we're going to
do
okay so now we
have
have
weights we.
weights we.
size X
is that
correct and now we're on com
correct and now we're on com
2 we're just going to
2 we're just going to
[Music]
[Music]
do make com 2D
3x3 ah this hidden dim is
3x3 ah this hidden dim is
wrong this
is this is CNN
channels right
linear yeah I think that was
linear yeah I think that was
it so it was uh I forgot that this was
it so it was uh I forgot that this was
not a uh a tested implementation
can I fix this stupid thing this error
can I fix this stupid thing this error
drives me nuts cuz I can't ever know
drives me nuts cuz I can't ever know
what is a real error
obnoxious I don't want to relaunch this
obnoxious I don't want to relaunch this
right now
but there we
go
615 so now we're at make
615 so now we're at make
lstm so let's see what other dims might
lstm so let's see what other dims might
be wrong here so make this
be wrong here so make this
Con hidden
dim
D that doesn't change anything
so this is
3x3 on a 3X3 input
what's
what's
this like kernel
size 3x3 yeah yeah so this is Kernel
size 3x3 yeah yeah so this is Kernel
size three this is
size three this is
good and you have
linear oh in features
linear oh in features
is CNN channels right
is CNN channels right
CNN channels to Hidden Dem yeah okay so
CNN channels to Hidden Dem yeah okay so
this is a little
different whoa whoa
different whoa whoa
whoa Heap overflow
how's that happen
invalid path to
external this is some like
external this is some like
Jank I should be getting a real error
Jank I should be getting a real error
message here this is just some weird
message here this is just some weird
Jank thing
though I guess it's you know what it is
though I guess it's you know what it is
I see
I see
it yeah
it yeah
um and obs
or
C oh this still
C oh this still
fails so if I set this to fault and it
fails so if I set this to fault and it
still
still
fails then there's something in making
fails then there's something in making
the network itself
the network itself
that's
weird [ __ ] is wrong with this
weird [ __ ] is wrong with this
thing give me a real eror message come
on why is my symbolizer
broken for
there we
there we
go I can debug as long as I have a real

observations
193 so what was this four grid size 10 4
193 so what was this four grid size 10 4
four
agents
trash so we have this demo
here which looks totally fine so why is
this compute observations really
welcome
welcome
folks uh only on for a little longer
folks uh only on for a little longer
here I'm just trying to Port this
here I'm just trying to Port this
network to see so that we can run this
network to see so that we can run this
demo on the web because we have policies
demo on the web because we have policies
training on
this fun little
environment 372
so I have a heap overflow
here oh I know what it
here oh I know what it
is yeah I didn't test
is yeah I didn't test
um yeah I know what it is
total this thing is
dated this is times 5 here as
well
ay they're moving
ay they're moving
randomly but it does run in C
so now let's get these C policies
working if so then we're just going to
working if so then we're just going to
do
do
four
in z e
in z e
m total nums
then we'll do
then we'll do
net this is for the
CP let's try
this more buffer
overflow I do not mind these as long as
overflow I do not mind these as long as
I get real error messages
according to this this is out of bounds
according to this this is out of bounds
which is
which is
odd
odd
uh net op should be good
here
.h num agents times input times
.h num agents times input times
input times num
input times num
channels input
and ni
float still no oh no that's yeah yeah
float still no oh no that's yeah yeah
it's good that's just uh I have a screwy
it's good that's just uh I have a screwy
system here that just I have to change
system here that just I have to change
some Docker
some Docker
Flags so yeah now you can see that this
Flags so yeah now you can see that this
policy is correctly deployed into
policy is correctly deployed into
C this is running
C this is running
locally in pure
locally in pure
C these puffers cannot find this last
C these puffers cannot find this last
one they can only see locally so they
one they can only see locally so they
don't how to find
don't how to find
it see new
one all right that's
fun you can take over the the red puffer
I think I'll leave the rest to Xander
I think I'll leave the rest to Xander
though I think this is a nice start I
though I think this is a nice start I
think what we're going to do is we're
think what we're going to do is we're
going to uh here we'll hit escape on
going to uh here we'll hit escape on
this let's actually fix this so that
this let's actually fix this so that
this doesn't have memory leaks
and
waits ignore those Z fults that's
waits ignore those Z fults that's
literally just my system if it runs like
literally just my system if it runs like
this then it's good here I'll show you
this then it's good here I'll show you
that it
runs yeah this is good
okay can I run this perk
test Let's uh if I'm want to do it let's
test Let's uh if I'm want to do it let's
do it in fast mode
so this is 2 million let me see if he
so this is 2 million let me see if he
did the per test right Inc is num
agents I plus equal ink yeah he did this
agents I plus equal ink yeah he did this
correct and that's about what I'd expect
correct and that's about what I'd expect
I mean it's it could be made a little
I mean it's it could be made a little
faster sure but this is fine four agents
faster sure but this is fine four agents
yeah so he has this perfectly
reasonable uh we'll see why it's
reasonable uh we'll see why it's
dropping some perf I think it'll
dropping some perf I think it'll
actually be maybe a little faster now
actually be maybe a little faster now
that tweaked
that tweaked
it I don't
know I need to get mcrip in on
this we can build for
web and we'll show you the web build
process all right so
msdk install latest
and then we just have this build script
and then we just have this build script
that does it for you when you just do
that does it for you when you just do
um just specify web
uh I missed the
command okay
web you see that this runs in
web you see that this runs in
browser now all I have to do is get it
browser now all I have to do is get it
onto my main
onto my main
page so we do is just
copy uh this goes oops actually I don't
copy uh this goes oops actually I don't
have the website buildt on this yet do I
the website is Trivial just HTML CSS
the website is Trivial just HTML CSS
little
JavaScript and the uh the Wason
builds Ranch
up and we need a thumbnail for
up and we need a thumbnail for
it so we'll just
do oops
I just get like thumbnails like this for
I just get like thumbnails like this for
it
[Music]
[Music]
and looks
and looks
good we're just going
to this is
to this is
trash pick
trash pick
up
up
now
okay just like
uh
copy okay so now all I have to do is
copy okay so now all I have to do is
add I add this in here nope not
there let's see where I want to add
it I'm a web developer
it I'm a web developer
now uh right after rware I'd
say I actually think that uh Xander
say I actually think that uh Xander
wrote me he wrote me a little blur for
wrote me he wrote me a little blur for
this didn't
he makes it
he makes it
easier love it when contributors don't
easier love it when contributors don't
make my life
hard take
did he
did he
do I don't know if he did the up
controls let me see if he realized if he
controls let me see if he realized if he
remember to do
that oh he did good job Xander
3 drop of nearby house one
hot it's discreet
so we just fix this up real
quick and then how big is this
quick and then how big is this
end GD
size is
10 how big is this client
plus okay so this should
plus okay so this should
be
be
4 400 460 if I'm
correct looks
correct looks
good
uh so
let's see if it
works
oops
ah y it
works only thing I got to do other than
works only thing I got to do other than
that
that
is you get added to the main page
Xander uh how much work is this I say
Xander uh how much work is this I say
right around
right around
here I I kind of do it semi
arbitrarily don't think about it too
arbitrarily don't think about it too
much
I once again
uh is this in the docks let me fix this
uh is this in the docks let me fix this
while uh let me just fix this while I'm
while uh let me just fix this while I'm
here I have the docks open already
oh
yeah whoops
[Music]
then we'll just test this for him
okay docs games index
okay docs games index
crash pick
up oh that's you on stream yeah fixed uh
up oh that's you on stream yeah fixed uh
let me fix your other thing real quick
let me fix your other thing real quick
as
well yeah that's how easy it is to get
well yeah that's how easy it is to get
help with puffer right this is half the
help with puffer right this is half the
reason I stream is you literally get
reason I stream is you literally get
instant
gratification um
I thought this C my
I thought this C my
credentials one second
okay so this is now
okay so this is now
uploaded uh this will be live in a
uploaded uh this will be live in a
second so the second
second so the second
error if I ran it from
error if I ran it from
Ocean yeah so this is just like in the
Ocean yeah so this is just like in the
wrong spot to find RB uh RB gets set up
wrong spot to find RB uh RB gets set up
in the root of the project um so if you
in the root of the project um so if you
just put the back end it should work now
just put the back end it should work now
and this will be updated in a
and this will be updated in a
second it takes like a minute to
second it takes like a minute to
deploy but you'll see it in a second and
deploy but you'll see it in a second and
I'll double check the trash end and then
I'll double check the trash end and then
we'll call that for the uh for the day
we'll call that for the uh for the day
Xander will be happy to see
this if you
import
import
from the ocean
snake
huh
uh hang on
yeah so you're not meant to import that
yeah so you're not meant to import that
from arbitary spot uh if you import that
from arbitary spot uh if you import that
from the root directory it will work
from the root directory it will work
otherwise if you just use puffer lib
otherwise if you just use puffer lib
normally puffer lib takes care of
normally puffer lib takes care of
importing that for you you don't need to
importing that for you you don't need to
import s snake that is the underlying
import s snake that is the underlying
scyon
wrapper this will just give you snake
wrapper this will just give you snake
wherever do I have this in the dock
wherever do I have this in the dock
somewhere or did you just do
somewhere or did you just do
this uh I do not have this in the
this uh I do not have this in the
docs so
docs so
yeah the scon ones uh these are
yeah the scon ones uh these are
sensitive to Linker paths the python
sensitive to Linker paths the python
ones are not the python ones literally
ones are not the python ones literally
just call the scyon ones they're very
just call the scyon ones they're very
efficient uh you don't need to mess with
efficient uh you don't need to mess with
this ithon once yourself
tell me if that
works do let me know before I go if that
works do let me know before I go if that
works I don't does this mean it
worked in testing
worked in testing
okay uh so this is updated on the web
okay uh so this is updated on the web
page then o
page then o
I neur 3 always takes a second to load
I neur 3 always takes a second to load
no biggie trash
pickup yeah sander
me commit his policy
I break
it no it's just my okay I'm good
and I will merge this to 20 as well
and I will merge this to 20 as well
right
right
now no reason not to it's stable
make sure nothing Jank is in
make sure nothing Jank is in
here pick
here pick
up
up
[Music]
environment that's
good
for e
module well if you literally just pulled
module well if you literally just pulled
the latest then you have to
rebuild if you just pulled my latest
rebuild if you just pulled my latest
code then yeah you have to rebuild it
code then yeah you have to rebuild it
right like set up build X
right like set up build X
in
place I will test it but I think we're
place I will test it but I think we're
good
I don't know why it's slower now
if that works let me know and I'm going
if that works let me know and I'm going
to
dinner uh something got slowed down here
dinner uh something got slowed down here
I don't know what the
heck maybe I have stuff in the
heck maybe I have stuff in the
background
huh slower than
before Oh that's actually probably legit
before Oh that's actually probably legit
because of the channel order
because of the channel order
change you should be able to get around
change you should be able to get around
that
though
for
e
e e
going wait for this one guy to test it
going wait for this one guy to test it
and then we're going to
dinner it's solid though we get a new uh
dinner it's solid though we get a new uh
new M up on the website
uh uppercase
uh uppercase
snake here watch my
snake here watch my
screen also yeah you can see it
works from puffer lib ocean
works from puffer lib ocean
snake
snake
snake and then also uh if you don't want
snake and then also uh if you don't want
to do that from puffer Li
to do that from puffer Li
ocean import and creator
ocean import and creator
creater function and
creater function and
creater does it make function
creater does it make function
make
make
snake puffer snake or
snake puffer snake or
whatever
make you
make you
see they should all be in the docks as
see they should all be in the docks as
well let me know if it's not or at least
well let me know if it's not or at least
if it's not clear
yep works now a
yep works now a
okay um I don't think Xander's on stream
okay um I don't think Xander's on stream
so I will chat with him
so I will chat with him
async uh I've given him some cool stuff
async uh I've given him some cool stuff
to look at he's got a cool new policy to
to look at he's got a cool new policy to
look at and see he's got some nice M
look at and see he's got some nice M
changes to look at he's got this thing
changes to look at he's got this thing
training and up on the website so that's
training and up on the website so that's
solid for
solid for
today
today
um more M to be integrated over the next
um more M to be integrated over the next
few days I got some Dentistry to
few days I got some Dentistry to
tomorrow which is not going to be fun so
tomorrow which is not going to be fun so
I don't know if I'm going to be doing
I don't know if I'm going to be doing
stuff here tomorrow and then the day
stuff here tomorrow and then the day
after is Christmas but I'll be back
after is Christmas but I'll be back
shortly after Christmas and there'll be
shortly after Christmas and there'll be
lots of stuff to do so thanks
lots of stuff to do so thanks
folks and uh see you around

Kind: captions
Language: en
okay should be live
here I have to mess with this cut off
here I have to mess with this cut off
later actually can I just real
later actually can I just real
quick
quick
nope let's see do I have H no I don't
nope let's see do I have H no I don't
have any margin on this all right I'll
have any margin on this all right I'll
fuss with the green screen
fuss with the green screen
later oops
we'll keep this for
now we're back
now we're back
though see how far I can pull this
though see how far I can pull this
before it gets in the
before it gets in the
shot there we go um
cool I got a chair upgrade
Xander love the reskin never would have
Xander love the reskin never would have
figured out the permute thing yep very
figured out the permute thing yep very
very common screw up I knew to look for
very common screw up I knew to look for
it because I've debugged this exact
it because I've debugged this exact
thing probably at least 100
times value for out of
bounds it's fine the way you did
it try to replacing nor
normal
but one of my
but one of my
yep pretty much that
yep pretty much that
uh create channel for stream discussions
here first Pac-Man
policy look at
policy look at
that doesn't look
optimal yeah definitely not optimal
passible
passible
though oh it does
backrack not optimal but
decent give you a puffer for
decent give you a puffer for
that BL
that BL
blob very
blob very
nice yesterday
assuming
uh problem with normal is that it
uh problem with normal is that it
assumes single modal
eat you
new M here is going
new M here is going
well so
well so
uh I guess what do we do here we look
uh I guess what do we do here we look
at Xander m a little bit or we look at
at Xander m a little bit or we look at
bets M I'm trying to
bets M I'm trying to
think let's look what PRS we've got open
think let's look what PRS we've got open
I have a ton of time now I kind of just
I have a ton of time now I kind of just
wanted to test out this uh this new
wanted to test out this uh this new
setup to see see if I like this chair
setup to see see if I like this chair
here for my desk I'm sitting down a
here for my desk I'm sitting down a
little bit
little bit
low well that's
fine uh what am I
fine uh what am I
doing welcome YouTube
folks so we've
folks so we've
got code ball
no other PRS open or
no other PRS open or
environments so I think what we do is we
environments so I think what we do is we
play with Xander end and uh we get this
play with Xander end and uh we get this
to a spot that we're happy
to a spot that we're happy
with this a cab
with this a cab
car Let's uh let's get to some
code see a message about action clipping
code see a message about action clipping
offer should
offer should
support for continuous
M
oh e
see Xander
stuff I think what we'll
do h
I'm trying to
think I could use a standard network if
think I could use a standard network if
I just took one small obnoxious thing
I just took one small obnoxious thing
out of his observation
space but then it wouldn't be able to
space but then it wouldn't be able to
tell if it's carrying anything
anything
37 unclip should be
I'm trying to think what I want to do
I'm trying to think what I want to do
with Xander's
with Xander's
policy cuz
like I almost just want to mess with it
like I almost just want to mess with it
and like
and like
add add a
channel
channel
right yeah cuz it's kind of slow as
right yeah cuz it's kind of slow as
well I don't know how much time I have
well I don't know how much time I have
to screw with it at the moment but we'll
to screw with it at the moment but we'll
try some
stuff we're going to get rid of this one
stuff we're going to get rid of this one
plus
plus
um this goes to
uh times five I
uh times five I
believe is that how we do
this uh no interestingly
enough how's the policy work in
enough how's the policy work in
this make linear lstm
oh I forgot I don't have a conf policy
oh I forgot I don't have a conf policy
for
this yeah that's
funny so I guess we can leave
funny so I guess we can leave
it we could leave it like this for now
it we could leave it like this for now
and just
and just
do I'm five this would be pretty easy to
do I'm five this would be pretty easy to
to update as
to update as
well um observation space should not be
float we'll mess with that later though
float we'll mess with that later though
I think this is a major
I think this is a major
issue this is using like way too much
data so let's mess with this now
data so let's mess with this now
actually
the thing that's bothering me is
like so the thing that's bothering me is
like so the thing that's bothering me is
that you technically don't want to one
that you technically don't want to one
hot it in the environment you want to
hot it in the environment you want to
one hot it in the
one hot it in the
policy it's a
policy it's a
nitpick it does have implications for
nitpick it does have implications for
bandwidth
so I think we'll do this for
now and then we'll do
now and then we'll do
compute observations
right num cell types is
four for
we'll try this I just wanted to add a
we'll try this I just wanted to add a
carrying Channel
this might be enough
already let's see if this
already let's see if this
works okay so that does build we need to
works okay so that does build we need to
change the
change the
observations this is char
are oh it's unsigned
okay and then the only thing we got to
okay and then the only thing we got to
do is
do is
OBS they're no longer
floats I could actually you know what I
floats I could actually you know what I
could do is I could make it a signed
Char yeah maybe we'll make it a signed
Char yeah maybe we'll make it a signed
char
there we
go now it'll allow us to keep the
go now it'll allow us to keep the
negative
ones whether that's a good idea I don't
know1 okay so it's on 1 0 negative 1
know1 okay so it's on 1 0 negative 1
this is actually
this is actually
fine totally
fine all I have to do is I changed this
fine all I have to do is I changed this
from uate to
in8 this is
Char this is going to be
Char oh wait
yeah it is Char is signed yes
yeah it is Char is signed yes
right I think I'm
right I think I'm
fine we'll see shortly but I think I'm
fine we'll see shortly but I think I'm
correct
here we have to update the network as
here we have to update the network as
well
I think it's literally this network
I think it's literally this network
right here isn't
right here isn't
it oh look uh this has one hot in it
so let's try
so let's try
this this is five
this this is five
pannels and this is Yep this is
good uh we do not need to one hot this
I do need to go get this line that I
I do need to go get this line that I
wrote
before it's going to be right
here we no longer need this
andom channels
andom channels
it's going to be
five
remute no longer need one
remute no longer need one
hot return the
hot return the
network
network
cool I believe I can get rid of
cool I believe I can get rid of
this whole thing
now obviously I'm not going to push this
now obviously I'm not going to push this
without uh seeing if it works just as
without uh seeing if it works just as
well if not
well if not
better I bet we will be able to get this
better I bet we will be able to get this
thing working
cleanly inputs
cleanly inputs
type
type
yes that is
yes that is
fair
Flo okay so it's already faster
let's see if it
learns and uh I think that
while I forgot
while I forgot
track let's do that
track let's do that
track uh while I wait for this I think
track uh while I wait for this I think
we'll go get our puffer friend
back there he
back there he
is
is
[Music]
[Music]
transform you can go right over
transform you can go right over
here
chat yeah
we
go I thought I had a better version of
go I thought I had a better version of
him um this one has like a little
him um this one has like a little
artifacting but we'll leave him for
now how's this
now how's this
doing hard to say so
far we'll wait to see if it takes off
if not we'll have to do some data
if not we'll have to do some data
examination the M also appears to have
examination the M also appears to have
some speed issues we will look into
some speed issues we will look into
those and just about everything else
those and just about everything else
that we need to do
today I'd like to get a network and C
today I'd like to get a network and C
deployed to this so we can put this onto
deployed to this so we can put this onto
the
the
website that would be
website that would be
ideal episode return is way
ideal episode return is way
higher uh which is
weird possibly something happening
I thought this one right here
was this is the 100 one right here
was this is the 100 one right here
right why is the episode return so
low we'll let that run and then we'll
low we'll let that run and then we'll
see what I could have possibly changed
this episode reward
this episode reward
looks actually looks correct to me it
looks actually looks correct to me it
looks like it was wrong
looks like it was wrong
before but now it doesn't appear to
before but now it doesn't appear to
train when it did train
train when it did train
before
H is it increasing it is actually
H is it increasing it is actually
increasing though which is
increasing though which is
odd you see it's got this like steady
odd you see it's got this like steady
increase to
it looks
too well I could just that could be the
too well I could just that could be the
observations totally being messed up
observations totally being messed up
though let me
see so here I did
cell types is
four and then this is the fifth one
four and then this is the fifth one
right ooh hold
on plus one I think this is missing a
on plus one I think this is missing a
plus
one um the reason I caught that is
uh it's common like if you mess with the
uh it's common like if you mess with the
observation bases to just be writing
observation bases to just be writing
data in the wrong
data in the wrong
spot so I think there that was like
spot so I think there that was like
misaligning the
bites welcome YouTube
folks if we can get a uh a nice clean
folks if we can get a uh a nice clean
policy trained on this then what I will
policy trained on this then what I will
do is I will Port it to see and then
do is I will Port it to see and then
upload it to the website so we can
upload it to the website so we can
actually see this thing
online okay so immediately this is run
online okay so immediately this is run
is way
better how think Xander's going to
better how think Xander's going to
be it's like yeah this is this is what
be it's like yeah this is this is what
you can just do with your
en R
instantly this is actually even slower
instantly this is actually even slower
than I think it should be I think it'll
than I think it should be I think it'll
be way better after hyper pram sweep
interestingly it seems to be fluctuating
interestingly it seems to be fluctuating
a
a
bit that could totally just be hyper
bit that could totally just be hyper
prams
prams
though yeah there we go
h
curious how it's going to uh the end
curious how it's going to uh the end
behavior if it's going to actually
behavior if it's going to actually
get the near 20 or if it's going to
get the near 20 or if it's going to
fiddle out around
fiddle out around
here I can always just increase the
here I can always just increase the
episode length by like 20 steps
if it gets
stuck Xander will be happy with this
stuck Xander will be happy with this
either
way does seem to be fluctuating a fair
way does seem to be fluctuating a fair
bit looking at the episode length
bit looking at the episode length
I think it doesn't have enough time to
I think it doesn't have enough time to
solve the task not
solve the task not
consistently you can see so I'm going to
consistently you can see so I'm going to
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
kill this
and I'm going to do Max steps to 150
here and you can see it's working it's
here and you can see it's working it's
like it's up to the 19 here just it's
like it's up to the 19 here just it's
it's fiddly around here cuz like oh is
it's fiddly around here cuz like oh is
it figuring it
out I can't
out I can't
tell let's kill this and then for
tell let's kill this and then for
comparison we'll run
um 200 mil
um 200 mil
steps 50 mil steps even
16 I bet this works
better this policy should be
better this policy should be
substantially easier to port to see as

see so literally

um o the data permute though isn't
there yeah so I might have to screw with
there yeah so I might have to screw with
the

19 and yeah now you can see the episode

length is around
length is around
120 um so that's more
120 um so that's more
reasonable it has enough time to
reasonable it has enough time to
complete the

to like 100
Mil for

all right that's solid that's nice and
stable I'm happy with

permute I'm not happy with the day the
permute I'm not happy with the day the
way the layout of the data is in this
environment yeah cuz hold
environment yeah cuz hold
on let me figure this out so this is
on let me figure this out so this is
important like you want your data to be
important like you want your data to be
in the
in the
format you want your data to be laid out
format you want your data to be laid out
in memory the way that you're going to
in memory the way that you're going to
need the data when you go to use
it so what does this happen What Happens
it so what does this happen What Happens
here
so crop size crop size
so crop size crop size
five. permute
okay so this is Channel's
okay so this is Channel's
last we want channels first technically
last we want channels first technically
Channel's last is actually the better
Channel's last is actually the better
layout for a comp but because puffer net
layout for a comp but because puffer net
matches pie torch we will do it this
way
uh I could also do this in the python
uh I could also do this in the python
layer but like
layer but like
it should be easy
right let me see how it's working
here so
it is kind of a gross way to access
it is kind of a gross way to access
memory I have to move this Loop over
memory I have to move this Loop over
cell
cell
types believe I have to move this to the
outside that's kind of gross
outside that's kind of gross
right cuz you're like filling in one
right cuz you're like filling in one
layer at a
time h
it might not be that
it might not be that
bad let's just do it and then we'll
know
Dy wait
Dy oh yeah no this is super
Dy oh yeah no this is super
gross you have to redo the bounce
checks Xander has it right here it's
checks Xander has it right here it's
just pytorch has it wrong this bothered
just pytorch has it wrong this bothered
me about pytorch for a
me about pytorch for a
while you really want your com dat to be
while you really want your com dat to be
Channel's last formatted
and just do it for now and then we'll
and just do it for now and then we'll
see how bad it
is let's do like
is let's do like
this so we do type
so y so
X if C so what you do is I think we flip
X if C so what you do is I think we flip
this if it's less than
this if it's less than
zero
zero
or this is just basic
or this is just basic
code greater than
equal
or less than
zero and then what we
zero and then what we
do is
do is
OBS plus plus is
OBS plus plus is
-1 and then we do like this continue
otherwise we get the grid
cell
cell
if type was it type
else this entity
one I think this is the same

logic uh we have a very easy way of
logic uh we have a very easy way of
testing that just by compiling it and
testing that just by compiling it and
seeing if it
seeing if it
works I think this is actually slightly
works I think this is actually slightly
worse than Xander's original design
worse than Xander's original design
because this is a less efficient Loop
because this is a less efficient Loop

this makes it easier for p

here yeah there we go

go okay puffer Li ocean porch trash
go okay puffer Li ocean porch trash
pickup and then all we got to
do do
view now we just laid out correctly in

it that should be good
let's see if it still trains or if I

puffer very
good looks like it's

training we will compare the

modulo sub type shenanigans
which I think is still pretty easy I

copy that you have to do uh for the typ
copy that you have to do uh for the typ

I think we should just be able to

though looking at this yeah there we

good

policy that I can
use let me see what like what

I used it in

oh
oh
um do I just have that thing and I've
um do I just have that thing and I've
never used
it
maybe envel
STM just need the signature
we do weights
we do weights

go okay

PT all this does is export the weights
PT all this does is export the weights
to a flat

also tells me how big the net is in this
also tells me how big the net is in this

150 2
150 2
four 2 four five that's the size of the

work now the only thing I'm not sure oh
work now the only thing I'm not sure oh
I also have to copy
I also have to copy

say what would have caused that
this is obsc Fu con Fu
this is obsc Fu con Fu
linear pretty sure this is the same
linear pretty sure this is the same

sure but let me
see inut D input
channels let
channels let
see input d it's 11 and then channnel
see input d it's 11 and then channnel
got five input channels 32 CNN channels
got five input channels 32 CNN channels

uh just change something
uh just change something

here nope
yeah there it is
yeah there it is
one 5
32 wait stride
32 wait stride
three that's what I use isn't
it
it
yeah five by five it's tried three
that's
weird it's a real error
65 up foret
let me see where this uh this
fails this say it fails
at right
at right
here well something's definitely wrong
here well something's definitely wrong
with that because it definitely should
with that because it definitely should
not be out of
parameters by
here oh I know what it
here oh I know what it
is don't
is don't
I oh no surprisingly I
I oh no surprisingly I
don't I'm
agents h
maybe hold
on input them
on input them
what channels CNN channels 32 hidden dim
what channels CNN channels 32 hidden dim
is 120 action is 4 now this is
is 120 action is 4 now this is
absolutely
correct I don't know if I ever tested
correct I don't know if I ever tested
this comp to be
fair it is actually 11 by 11 right
see yeah no the input dim is correct
here
here
wait CAC
something's not right
something's not right
here his OBS doesn't have a
channels isn't this time's channels
and what do we do Waits make come to
and what do we do Waits make come to
the D input D input
the D input D input
[Music]
[Music]
channels three
out channels in channels
H
interesting do I use this anywhere
make com
to so no I don't actually use this so
to so no I don't actually use this so
this is
this is
untested so that would make sense why it
untested so that would make sense why it
is not
is not
working
um
yep let me see so
yep let me see so
weights
weights
agents in width in
agents in width in
height in channels out
height in channels out
channels size Trad so this is this call
channels size Trad so this is this call
looks correct so why does this take up
looks correct so why does this take up
so many damn
so many damn
parameters there's what we're going to

do
okay so now we
have
have
weights we.
weights we.
size X
is that
correct and now we're on com
correct and now we're on com
2 we're just going to
2 we're just going to
[Music]
[Music]
do make com 2D
3x3 ah this hidden dim is
3x3 ah this hidden dim is
wrong this
is this is CNN
channels right
linear yeah I think that was
linear yeah I think that was
it so it was uh I forgot that this was
it so it was uh I forgot that this was
not a uh a tested implementation
can I fix this stupid thing this error
can I fix this stupid thing this error
drives me nuts cuz I can't ever know
drives me nuts cuz I can't ever know
what is a real error
obnoxious I don't want to relaunch this
obnoxious I don't want to relaunch this
right now
but there we
go
615 so now we're at make
615 so now we're at make
lstm so let's see what other dims might
lstm so let's see what other dims might
be wrong here so make this
be wrong here so make this
Con hidden
dim
D that doesn't change anything
so this is
3x3 on a 3X3 input
what's
what's
this like kernel
size 3x3 yeah yeah so this is Kernel
size 3x3 yeah yeah so this is Kernel
size three this is
size three this is
good and you have
linear oh in features
linear oh in features
is CNN channels right
is CNN channels right
CNN channels to Hidden Dem yeah okay so
CNN channels to Hidden Dem yeah okay so
this is a little
different whoa whoa
different whoa whoa
whoa Heap overflow
how's that happen
invalid path to
external this is some like
external this is some like
Jank I should be getting a real error
Jank I should be getting a real error
message here this is just some weird
message here this is just some weird
Jank thing
though I guess it's you know what it is
though I guess it's you know what it is
I see
I see
it yeah
it yeah
um and obs
or
C oh this still
C oh this still
fails so if I set this to fault and it
fails so if I set this to fault and it
still
still
fails then there's something in making
fails then there's something in making
the network itself
the network itself
that's
weird [ __ ] is wrong with this
weird [ __ ] is wrong with this
thing give me a real eror message come
on why is my symbolizer
broken for

there we
go I can debug as long as I have a real

observations
193 so what was this four grid size 10 4
193 so what was this four grid size 10 4
four
agents
trash so we have this demo
here which looks totally fine so why is
this compute observations really
welcome
welcome
folks uh only on for a little longer
folks uh only on for a little longer
here I'm just trying to Port this
here I'm just trying to Port this
network to see so that we can run this
network to see so that we can run this
demo on the web because we have policies
demo on the web because we have policies
training on
this fun little
environment 372
so I have a heap overflow
here oh I know what it
here oh I know what it
is yeah I didn't test
is yeah I didn't test
um yeah I know what it is
total this thing is
dated this is times 5 here as
well
ay they're moving
ay they're moving
randomly but it does run in C
so now let's get these C policies
working if so then we're just going to
working if so then we're just going to
do
do
four
in z e
in z e
m total nums
then we'll do
then we'll do
net this is for the
CP let's try
this more buffer
overflow I do not mind these as long as
overflow I do not mind these as long as
I get real error messages
according to this this is out of bounds
according to this this is out of bounds
which is
which is
odd
odd
uh net op should be good
here
.h num agents times input times
.h num agents times input times
input times num
input times num
channels input
and ni
float still no oh no that's yeah yeah
float still no oh no that's yeah yeah
it's good that's just uh I have a screwy
it's good that's just uh I have a screwy
system here that just I have to change
system here that just I have to change
some Docker
some Docker
Flags so yeah now you can see that this
Flags so yeah now you can see that this
policy is correctly deployed into
policy is correctly deployed into
C this is running
C this is running
locally in pure
locally in pure
C these puffers cannot find this last
C these puffers cannot find this last
one they can only see locally so they
one they can only see locally so they
don't how to find
don't how to find
it see new
one all right that's
fun you can take over the the red puffer
I think I'll leave the rest to Xander
I think I'll leave the rest to Xander
though I think this is a nice start I
though I think this is a nice start I
think what we're going to do is we're
think what we're going to do is we're
going to uh here we'll hit escape on
going to uh here we'll hit escape on
this let's actually fix this so that
this let's actually fix this so that
this doesn't have memory leaks
and
waits ignore those Z fults that's
waits ignore those Z fults that's
literally just my system if it runs like
literally just my system if it runs like
this then it's good here I'll show you
this then it's good here I'll show you
that it
runs yeah this is good
okay can I run this perk
test Let's uh if I'm want to do it let's
test Let's uh if I'm want to do it let's
do it in fast mode
so this is 2 million let me see if he
so this is 2 million let me see if he
did the per test right Inc is num
agents I plus equal ink yeah he did this
agents I plus equal ink yeah he did this
correct and that's about what I'd expect
correct and that's about what I'd expect
I mean it's it could be made a little
I mean it's it could be made a little
faster sure but this is fine four agents
faster sure but this is fine four agents
yeah so he has this perfectly
reasonable uh we'll see why it's
reasonable uh we'll see why it's
dropping some perf I think it'll
dropping some perf I think it'll
actually be maybe a little faster now
actually be maybe a little faster now
that tweaked
that tweaked
it I don't
know I need to get mcrip in on
this we can build for
web and we'll show you the web build
process all right so
msdk install latest
and then we just have this build script
and then we just have this build script
that does it for you when you just do
that does it for you when you just do
um just specify web
uh I missed the
command okay
web you see that this runs in
web you see that this runs in
browser now all I have to do is get it
browser now all I have to do is get it
onto my main
onto my main
page so we do is just
copy uh this goes oops actually I don't
copy uh this goes oops actually I don't
have the website buildt on this yet do I
the website is Trivial just HTML CSS
the website is Trivial just HTML CSS
little
JavaScript and the uh the Wason
builds Ranch
up and we need a thumbnail for
up and we need a thumbnail for
it so we'll just
do oops
I just get like thumbnails like this for
I just get like thumbnails like this for
it
[Music]
[Music]
and looks
and looks
good we're just going
to this is
to this is
trash pick
trash pick
up
up
now
okay just like
uh
copy okay so now all I have to do is
copy okay so now all I have to do is
add I add this in here nope not
there let's see where I want to add
it I'm a web developer
it I'm a web developer
now uh right after rware I'd
say I actually think that uh Xander
say I actually think that uh Xander
wrote me he wrote me a little blur for
wrote me he wrote me a little blur for
this didn't
he makes it
he makes it
easier love it when contributors don't
easier love it when contributors don't
make my life
hard take
did he
did he
do I don't know if he did the up
controls let me see if he realized if he
controls let me see if he realized if he
remember to do
that oh he did good job Xander
3 drop of nearby house one
hot it's discreet
so we just fix this up real
quick and then how big is this
quick and then how big is this
end GD
size is
10 how big is this client
plus okay so this should
plus okay so this should
be
be
4 400 460 if I'm
correct looks
correct looks
good
uh so
let's see if it
works
oops
ah y it
works only thing I got to do other than
works only thing I got to do other than
that
that
is you get added to the main page
Xander uh how much work is this I say
Xander uh how much work is this I say
right around
right around
here I I kind of do it semi
arbitrarily don't think about it too
arbitrarily don't think about it too
much
I once again
uh is this in the docks let me fix this
uh is this in the docks let me fix this
while uh let me just fix this while I'm
while uh let me just fix this while I'm
here I have the docks open already
oh
yeah whoops
[Music]
then we'll just test this for him
okay docs games index
okay docs games index
crash pick
up oh that's you on stream yeah fixed uh
up oh that's you on stream yeah fixed uh
let me fix your other thing real quick
let me fix your other thing real quick
as
well yeah that's how easy it is to get
well yeah that's how easy it is to get
help with puffer right this is half the
help with puffer right this is half the
reason I stream is you literally get
reason I stream is you literally get
instant
gratification um
I thought this C my
I thought this C my
credentials one second
okay so this is now
okay so this is now
uploaded uh this will be live in a
uploaded uh this will be live in a
second so the second
second so the second
error if I ran it from
error if I ran it from
Ocean yeah so this is just like in the
Ocean yeah so this is just like in the
wrong spot to find RB uh RB gets set up
wrong spot to find RB uh RB gets set up
in the root of the project um so if you
in the root of the project um so if you
just put the back end it should work now
just put the back end it should work now
and this will be updated in a
and this will be updated in a
second it takes like a minute to
second it takes like a minute to
deploy but you'll see it in a second and
deploy but you'll see it in a second and
I'll double check the trash end and then
I'll double check the trash end and then
we'll call that for the uh for the day
we'll call that for the uh for the day
Xander will be happy to see
this if you
import
import
from the ocean
snake
huh
uh hang on
yeah so you're not meant to import that
yeah so you're not meant to import that
from arbitary spot uh if you import that
from arbitary spot uh if you import that
from the root directory it will work
from the root directory it will work
otherwise if you just use puffer lib
otherwise if you just use puffer lib
normally puffer lib takes care of
normally puffer lib takes care of
importing that for you you don't need to
importing that for you you don't need to
import s snake that is the underlying
import s snake that is the underlying
scyon
wrapper this will just give you snake
wrapper this will just give you snake
wherever do I have this in the dock
wherever do I have this in the dock
somewhere or did you just do
somewhere or did you just do
this uh I do not have this in the

docs so
docs so
yeah the scon ones uh these are
yeah the scon ones uh these are
sensitive to Linker paths the python
sensitive to Linker paths the python
ones are not the python ones literally
ones are not the python ones literally
just call the scyon ones they're very
just call the scyon ones they're very
efficient uh you don't need to mess with
efficient uh you don't need to mess with
this ithon once yourself
tell me if that
works do let me know before I go if that
works do let me know before I go if that
works I don't does this mean it
worked in testing
worked in testing
okay uh so this is updated on the web
okay uh so this is updated on the web
page then o
page then o
I neur 3 always takes a second to load
I neur 3 always takes a second to load
no biggie trash
pickup yeah sander
me commit his policy
I break
it no it's just my okay I'm good
and I will merge this to 20 as well
and I will merge this to 20 as well
right
right
now no reason not to it's stable
make sure nothing Jank is in
make sure nothing Jank is in
here pick
here pick
up
up
[Music]
environment that's
good
for e
module well if you literally just pulled
module well if you literally just pulled
the latest then you have to
rebuild if you just pulled my latest
rebuild if you just pulled my latest
code then yeah you have to rebuild it
code then yeah you have to rebuild it
right like set up build X
right like set up build X
in
place I will test it but I think we're
place I will test it but I think we're
good
I don't know why it's slower now
if that works let me know and I'm going
if that works let me know and I'm going
to
dinner uh something got slowed down here
dinner uh something got slowed down here
I don't know what the
heck maybe I have stuff in the
heck maybe I have stuff in the
background
huh slower than
before Oh that's actually probably legit
before Oh that's actually probably legit
because of the channel order
because of the channel order
change you should be able to get around
change you should be able to get around
that
though
for
e
e e
going wait for this one guy to test it
going wait for this one guy to test it
and then we're going to
dinner it's solid though we get a new uh
dinner it's solid though we get a new uh
new M up on the website
uh uppercase
uh uppercase
snake here watch my
snake here watch my

works from puffer lib ocean
works from puffer lib ocean

snake and then also uh if you don't want
to do that from puffer Li
to do that from puffer Li

make you
make you
see they should all be in the docks as
see they should all be in the docks as
well let me know if it's not or at least
well let me know if it's not or at least
if it's not clear
yep works now a
yep works now a
okay um I don't think Xander's on stream
okay um I don't think Xander's on stream
so I will chat with him
so I will chat with him
