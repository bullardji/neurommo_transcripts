We're just going to fix any and all

I found a couple other myself. You

So, I found this mess up right here.

Uh let's go.h. So this is the full code
Uh let's go.h. So this is the full code
of the target environment. 230 lines

that is what we run on this. Then if I
that is what we run on this. Then if I
do puffer eval
here we have puffers eating stars
and there's your model.
We have to add grid.
Very cool. Thank you. Let me actually
Very cool. Thank you. Let me actually
just get this onto the um
just get this onto the um
the Pi Pi repo.
the Pi Pi repo.
I think. Well, let's push it first.
Oh, I know what happened.
It's uh apparently target is like taken

That's what happened. That's silly.
And this is supposed to have weights. So
And this is supposed to have weights. So
we'll do
if you were a beginner and building some

I don't really like the thing is I don't
I don't really like the thing is I don't
do all that much on that side of things.
do all that much on that side of things.
Frankly, it's kind of just I just post
Frankly, it's kind of just I just post
technical content and I've been like
technical content and I've been like
consistently posting technical content
consistently posting technical content
in a niche area that I know a lot about
in a niche area that I know a lot about
for the last year and a half and then
for the last year and a half and then
I've gotten like a decentish audience on
I've gotten like a decentish audience on
X out of that. Um, a lot harder if
X out of that. Um, a lot harder if
you're a beginner, right?
You kind of just have to build something
You kind of just have to build something
really good and then show it off online
really good and then show it off online
publicly and then oftentimes good things
publicly and then oftentimes good things
get traction. It kind of depends how you
get traction. It kind of depends how you
package it. It's tough. I'm not an
package it. It's tough. I'm not an
advertiser, right? I'm a I'm a
advertiser, right? I'm a I'm a
researcher
and
So there we go.
Let me go get the uh there's like this
Let me go get the uh there's like this
annoying cache thing
cuz I'm in a new Docker container.
resume scanner. I only gained 24. I
resume scanner. I only gained 24. I
mean, yeah, because I mean, if you build
mean, yeah, because I mean, if you build
something which there are existing
something which there are existing
things in and it's like a pretty niche
things in and it's like a pretty niche
area and you don't have a platform to

tell people like I don't like what do
tell people like I don't like what do
you expect, right? It's difficult.
Okay. So now we will actually have the
Okay. So now we will actually have the
let me grab token.
Okay. So that is now fixed. We no longer

have tutorial broken on release day.
have tutorial broken on release day.

Absolutely build more stuff. But, you

It takes time to become a more

Takes a lot of time.
Takes a lot of time.
It also really depends what you optimize
It also really depends what you optimize
for as well, right? Let's
see how we're doing on X.
I mean,
I mean,
89 within uh
89 within uh
less than an hour of release is not bad.
We'll see how this does.
We'll see how this does.
I really do hope that this does quite
I really do hope that this does quite
well. This has been a lot of work.
need the Twitter hype, guys.
I don't know. I don't really want to go
I don't know. I don't really want to go
down the route of like paying
down the route of like paying
less technical less technical and larger
less technical less technical and larger

to like look at a very technical
to like look at a very technical
release thing, right? I got a nice
release thing, right? I got a nice
trailer cut together. Um,
trailer cut together. Um,
and we've done a few things,
and we've done a few things,
but that's about it.
but that's about it.
I mean, we have all sorts of articles
I mean, we have all sorts of articles
lined up that we'll be releasing all
lined up that we'll be releasing all
throughout the week as well.
I'm trying to think what other stuff I
I'm trying to think what other stuff I
I'm likely to need to fix. I technically
I'm likely to need to fix. I technically
did forget to put the grid environment
did forget to put the grid environment
on the website, didn't I? And that's
on the website, didn't I? And that's
like a really cool environment. So, I
like a really cool environment. So, I
think we'll do that live and then
think we'll do that live and then
that'll show people the process of like
that'll show people the process of like
running a net and see.
Very cool MIT mug.

Oh, I have a way cooler one that's in
Oh, I have a way cooler one that's in

that's just like the MIT logo is made

Want me to PR Asteroids? Yeah, go ahead
Want me to PR Asteroids? Yeah, go ahead
and PR asteroids, but I'm going to fix
and PR asteroids, but I'm going to fix
like a couple release things before I
like a couple release things before I
get to it.
get to it.
What's your like I have I mean we've
What's your like I have I mean we've
completed the release. We haven't like
completed the release. We haven't like

I'm here to solve the field.

Like when the we have this when the
Like when the we have this when the
field is solved, then I can go on to the
field is solved, then I can go on to the
next thing.
Right? Now we fix the field. There's an
Right? Now we fix the field. There's an
important distinction, right? So, by fix
important distinction, right? So, by fix
the field, I mean it's no longer a
the field, I mean it's no longer a
cursed buggy mess where basic things
cursed buggy mess where basic things
don't make any sense. It's actually
don't make any sense. It's actually
pretty sane and consistent now. And that
pretty sane and consistent now. And that
took a lot of work. Uh it's not solved
took a lot of work. Uh it's not solved
in the sense that like there's a massive
in the sense that like there's a massive
gap between how good it is now and how

Just go grab that plugin.

Then we will actually write some code

and I will show you how we uh how we

This is pretty cool.
Okay. So, what we have here is we're

going to use the breakout one as a

And what we have is it's set up uh we
And what we have is it's set up uh we
have the C code set up such that you can
have the C code set up such that you can
read in the weights with common layers
read in the weights with common layers
and even common predefined network

and then you can
and then you can
where is it?
Uh, you can export those weights into C
Uh, you can export those weights into C
and load them in. I think I said that
and load them in. I think I said that
backwards. So, one more time, you have
backwards. So, one more time, you have

there. Hang on.
there. Hang on.
I literally wrote this article just so I
I literally wrote this article just so I
just so I wouldn't have to answer this
just so I wouldn't have to answer this
exact question repeatedly.
exact question repeatedly.
There you go. I'm only half joking.
Got him.
That article didn't do super well, but I
That article didn't do super well, but I
kind of like it.
Okay, so it's five actions.
There's five actions.
And then the ob size is 2 * vision
And then the ob size is 2 * vision
range. So this is going to be 121.
Okay. So, here we're exporting the
Okay. So, here we're exporting the
pre-trained weights. This is the number
pre-trained weights. This is the number
of weights that we need.
of weights that we need.
And then what we're going to do,
we're going to make a folder for uh this
we're going to make a folder for uh this
new grid. this grid environment and then
new grid. this grid environment and then
we will copy
that into there. And now we're going to
that into there. And now we're going to
be able to load it from C. Created the
be able to load it from C. Created the
PR. I got to go study. Yeah, best of
PR. I got to go study. Yeah, best of
luck with that. Either later today or
luck with that. Either later today or
tomorrow or anytime this week pretty
tomorrow or anytime this week pretty
much. I just realized that I forgot to
much. I just realized that I forgot to
put the grid environment on the website.
put the grid environment on the website.
Actually, I want to do that real quick
Actually, I want to do that real quick
cuz it's a cool environment.
All right,
I will show how this uh this logic
I will show how this uh this logic
actually works. Let me just get the uh
actually works. Let me just get the uh
the boiler plate into place first, which
the boiler plate into place first, which
is where the model actually
or where we put the model in, which is
or where we put the model in, which is
we actually just do it like this.
And then
one agent.
one agent.
I don't know the D type of observations.
Ah, it's unsigned char. So, we actually
Ah, it's unsigned char. So, we actually
have to copy it. See, good thing I kept
have to copy it. See, good thing I kept
I uh I caught that.
So there is a thing where you can just
So there is a thing where you can just
use the observations directly. I think
use the observations directly. I think
it messes up if you don't copy them over
it messes up if you don't copy them over
though because of the dtype.
Then I will explain in a second how this
Then I will explain in a second how this
works.
It's ops, not observations.
Okay. So,
I also have to include a net.h
Okay.
Okay.
Does this work?
Uh, no it does not.
Cool.
Cool.
So, we'll have to figure out why this
So, we'll have to figure out why this
doesn't actually work here.
Oh, cuz actions is a float.
Oh, cuz actions is a float.
Whoops.
Apparently, I convert this from a I
Apparently, I convert this from a I
convert this to not a float somehow.
I haven't looked at this in a while.
So I'm just mucking something up with
So I'm just mucking something up with
the data, I'm sure.
the data, I'm sure.
So what is supposed to happen here,
So what is supposed to happen here,
right, is that you have this little
right, is that you have this little
linear layer LSTM plus LSTM network
linear layer LSTM plus LSTM network
that's been trained super fast in
that's been trained super fast in
PyTorch. And then I have this uh very
PyTorch. And then I have this uh very
small lightweight version
small lightweight version
uh of essentially PyTorch inference only
uh of essentially PyTorch inference only
but it defines the exact same layers
but it defines the exact same layers
that work the exact same way. We
that work the exact same way. We
maintain this as part of puffer lib and
maintain this as part of puffer lib and
you have this like very simple way to
you have this like very simple way to
just load in common network types using

it.
Now somehow I think that the data is
Now somehow I think that the data is
getting mixed up somewhere. There.
This is supposed to be int.
Okay. Except the network is supposed to
Okay. Except the network is supposed to
be here.
This is how it's supposed to look.
Yeah. So, this is how it's supposed to
Yeah. So, this is how it's supposed to
look.
That's what it's supposed to look like.
discretize this drill.
Let me make sure this is the right
Let me make sure this is the right

Yeah. So, there's nothing set for the uh
Yeah. So, there's nothing set for the uh
the vision range here at all.

Okay.
It is discreet at five, right?
Yes.
Yeah, it's not matching at all. Is it
Yeah, it's not matching at all. Is it
actually a linear LSTM?
Oh, I know what's wrong. I'm dumb.
Oh, I know what's wrong. I'm dumb.
Yeah, I know what's wrong.
Yeah, I know what's wrong.
Hey Doctor.
Perf depends heavily on tape size.
Perf depends heavily on tape size.
You're giving it as the observation. Is
You're giving it as the observation. Is
that not expected?
OBS Windows 16.
OBS Windows 16.
Are you having to zero it every step or
Are you having to zero it every step or
something?
I can take a look at it.
I can take a look at it.
Is the algorithm not supposed to be like
Is the algorithm not supposed to be like
quadratic in tape size or something?
Yeah, but like I don't know the end
Yeah, but like I don't know the end
dynamics enough, right?
Oh, when you say PF, do you mean how
Oh, when you say PF, do you mean how
fast it runs or how well the agent does?
There we go.
There we go.
How well it does. Ah, okay. So, I mean,
How well it does. Ah, okay. So, I mean,
it's probably just cuz it's randomly
it's probably just cuz it's randomly
sampling actions at the start and it can

That's somewhat disappointing if so.
Let's see if that does anything.

That's a good trick.
You know, I've seen this happen before

here. We'll see if we hit a fault. Now,
here. We'll see if we hit a fault. Now,
we do not had any fault. So, I mean,
we do not had any fault. So, I mean,
this says it's not some memory
this says it's not some memory

I've seen this happen in the actual eval

I mean this says we zero it, right?
To be fair, it is kind of janky the way

we're doing the policy.
I didn't miss anything. I don't think

Yeah, I don't think I missed anything.

I guess it's because we don't sample.
I guess we need the randomness of the
I guess we need the randomness of the

don't Do I believe that? Because if it

were just the randomness of the

like I can move it here and like it
like I can move it here and like it
should recover.
I mean, I guess it it kind of does.
I mean, I guess it it kind of does.
Oh, yeah, it does.
Okay. So, it's relying on the randomness
Okay. So, it's relying on the randomness
of the policy. That's what it is. So, we
of the policy. That's what it is. So, we
need to add the randomness back in.
Oh no, but it is random here, isn't it?
Oh no, but it is random here, isn't it?
It's not discreet. It's not a a fixed
It's not discreet. It's not a a fixed
sample. It is actually a random sample.
That's pretty irritating.
I mean the quick fix here for Yes.
This is a quick fix.
Ah, I mean, the fact that this doesn't
Ah, I mean, the fact that this doesn't
work tells you something's totally
work tells you something's totally
wrong.
I guess discretise is false.
This doesn't do anything.
Oh, cuz it we just set it to true.
Oh, cuz it we just set it to true.
That's fine then.
Okay. So, let's see why
why this would uh would happen.
I think there is actually a bug here.
Maybe this explains why we don't have
Maybe this explains why we don't have
perfect maze solving agents.

Let's take a look at that.
Rings will definitely be cool.
Make sure
A little bit fast, don't you think?
That's only 60 fps. Why is it that fast?
Is it because of like mcript and stuff?
What the heck?
That's not the web build.
Why is it run Why is it rendering that

Yeah, we think it's that

So, this is not the web build.
Huh?

Hang on.
Train this real quick.

Okay.
Okay. So, there's a render glitch

because this should not be happening
because this should not be happening
here. Yeah,
the speed is wrong. Like the drone
the speed is wrong. Like the drone
itself is too fast
cuz it's it's going in sharp angles.
What are max rings and max moves

There we are. Yes. So, if you don't set

Cool.
Let's see if drone's online.
Welcome major.
Oh yeah.
What's the next plan for drone then?
What's the next plan for drone then?
Trying to think how we uh how do we turn
Trying to think how we uh how do we turn
this into
I'm trying to think how we turn like get
I'm trying to think how we turn like get
from here to like champion drone racing,
from here to like champion drone racing,
right?
How do you generate where the rings are?
How do you generate where the rings are?
Are the rings random or is there some
Are the rings random or is there some
pattern to them?
Brother, how you got into MIT?
Uh, in order to get into a PhD, the best
Uh, in order to get into a PhD, the best
thing to have done is to already have
thing to have done is to already have
done half of a PhD. So, I pretty much
done half of a PhD. So, I pretty much
did that
random for now. Cool. Yeah. So, the
random for now. Cool. Yeah. So, the
thing I was thinking of, I don't know
thing I was thinking of, I don't know
how they actually set the courses.
how they actually set the courses.
Um,
I don't know if here I Let me show you
I don't know if here I Let me show you
what I was thinking.
what I was thinking.
Let me get my coffee first and then
Let me get my coffee first and then
we'll talk about what we can do with
we'll talk about what we can do with
drones.
Bezier, your curves were fine. Yeah, so
Bezier, your curves were fine. Yeah, so
that's what I was thinking.
I should have specified coffee and set.
The gym equipment is not just for show.
Oh yeah. You probably can't even see
Oh yeah. You probably can't even see
half of it anymore with the freaking
half of it anymore with the freaking
chair in the background. Yeah.
So this is not what I meant.
What do they use to generate racetracks?
What do they use to generate racetracks?
Right.
Maybe something like this.
And then you do the same thing like
And then you do the same thing like
height displaced as well
height displaced as well
cuz it's a drone.
Welcome folks.
This is the uh release day. Fixing
This is the uh release day. Fixing
things, merging things, and answering
things, merging things, and answering
questions on release.
I'll have a look around.
I'll have a look around.
Yeah, I think we should be a like if we
Yeah, I think we should be a like if we
get it to do a reasonable track. Now, I
get it to do a reasonable track. Now, I
actually don't know how well that fits
actually don't know how well that fits
because if you look up like Champion,
like isn't this the tracks are kind of
like isn't this the tracks are kind of
crazy, right?
Yeah. Like they don't really follow
Ah, okay. So, you see how the um
Ah, okay. So, you see how the um
like the borders of the targets are
like the borders of the targets are
specifically made for them to be easy to
specifically made for them to be easy to
track. So, it's just like some really
track. So, it's just like some really
basic state estimation stuff.
And then uh neural nets
And then uh neural nets
vio. Yeah. So it's not
vio. Yeah. So it's not
we can totally do something like this
we can totally do something like this
like this is just open CV running
like this is just open CV running
basically
they actually tell you how they do their
they actually tell you how they do their
physics as well
right there.
So, yeah, we could totally do something
So, yeah, we could totally do something
like this, right?
drone would be cool.
Scanning technique
Scanning technique
work with lidar camera. Do you need
work with lidar camera. Do you need
lidar?
lidar?
I don't think you need lidar.
I guess it kind of depends because like
I guess it kind of depends because like
they do they paint the targets to make
they do they paint the targets to make
them easier to do perception on, right?
I think also like they've got to have an
I think also like they've got to have an
order to the loops.
order to the loops.
So, it'll probably be something like 10
So, it'll probably be something like 10
hoops and like they're just in order in
hoops and like they're just in order in
the observations.
the observations.
We only use LAR cuz iPhones have one.
We only use LAR cuz iPhones have one.
Oh,
Oh,
you probably don't want to stick an
you probably don't want to stick an
iPhone on a drone. Okay.
But hey, look. I mean, it's on the
But hey, look. I mean, it's on the
website at least.
Yeah, I would think probably some sort
Yeah, I would think probably some sort
of like
it definitely has to be like larger
it definitely has to be like larger
scale, right? We'd want to see like a
scale, right? We'd want to see like a
larger area that it's flying over with
larger area that it's flying over with
more hoops that are like connected in
more hoops that are like connected in
some sort of sane way.
some sort of sane way.
probably numbered as well
because it shouldn't just be observing
because it shouldn't just be observing
like all the hoops. It should also have
like all the hoops. It should also have
them in order, right?
Does it get penalized for hitting the uh
Does it get penalized for hitting the uh
the rim at the moment?
All the groundwork should be there.
All the groundwork should be there.
Yeah. I think the only thing that's
Yeah. I think the only thing that's
going to be tricky is figuring out how
going to be tricky is figuring out how
to not spend forever on perception,
to not spend forever on perception,
right? To run it on a real drone.
Yes, they collide. Okay, cool.
Yes, they collide. Okay, cool.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, this is a pretty
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, this is a pretty
darn solid start, Oh,
I wonder if there's some basic thing we
I wonder if there's some basic thing we
can do where like even before we deal
can do where like even before we deal
with the perception part,
with the perception part,
can we just like see if this can fly a
can we just like see if this can fly a
drone from like point to point or stuff?
We rescan their route and do a three.
We rescan their route and do a three.
Oh, I see.
Not attached to the drone. I Okay, I
Not attached to the drone. I Okay, I
see.
We'll have to figure out what drones
We'll have to figure out what drones
would be like good to play with.
would be like good to play with.
So, I mean, getting it working in the
So, I mean, getting it working in the
real world for sure. And then the other
real world for sure. And then the other
question I have is like what's like the
question I have is like what's like the
most agile form factor we could get for
most agile form factor we could get for
a drone? Because even if it's something
a drone? Because even if it's something
that's incredibly difficult for a human
that's incredibly difficult for a human
to fly, we can probably just do it with
to fly, we can probably just do it with
RL easily, All right.

it's cool that you can get it to work,
but like you're just going to make

everything super slow.
We make everything super fast.
All right, let's go check a look at
All right, let's go check a look at
meta.
meta.
Here's what we're going to do.
I'm going to I'm going to sync this fork
I'm going to I'm going to sync this fork
now and then I'm not going to sync it

again
again
until we have it working because they
until we have it working because they
132 commits in the last week. Get out of
132 commits in the last week. Get out of
here.
Let me show off what this is actually
Let me show off what this is actually
before we uh we just start working on it
before we uh we just start working on it
so people can get an idea because I
so people can get an idea because I
promised these guys I would help them a
promised these guys I would help them a
little bit on this once we have the
little bit on this once we have the
release done. Um so I think we're going
release done. Um so I think we're going
to just start on on that. So meta
to just start on on that. So meta
is this pretty cool environment. It
is this pretty cool environment. It
looks like this.
looks like this.
It's kind of like a factory env in a
It's kind of like a factory env in a
sense where like there are different
sense where like there are different
resources you have to collect and then
resources you have to collect and then
move them to different collectors and
move them to different collectors and
converters and things. See you Sam.
So uh yeah, let's see what we can do
So uh yeah, let's see what we can do
about this.
Okay, we'll see what that does.

We're going to have to get pretty deep

I could make it more end to end. Yeah,
I could make it more end to end. Yeah,
the thing is like

you're confused about stuff rather than

They did this token Okay.
I go find they I think that they will

Oh jeez. This
Okay. I think
I think I just have to put this into the

ridiculous that they did it this way.
Yeah, I don't I just don't know why they

game to run at like 10 FPS max, like 5
to 10 FPS. Okay? So, every action moves
to 10 FPS. Okay? So, every action moves
the ship pretty far. and then you just
the ship pretty far. and then you just
smooth in animations when you actually
smooth in animations when you actually
render the game. That's one way to do
render the game. That's one way to do
it. The other way is to just do frame
it. The other way is to just do frame
skip. Probably with Asteroids, it'll be
skip. Probably with Asteroids, it'll be
fast enough to just do frame skip and
fast enough to just do frame skip and
match the other arcade MS. So that's
match the other arcade MS. So that's
probably what I would do.
We do it the other way around for like

Oh, they've just gone insane.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um I

did they actually do it this way.
That works.
Yeah, it literally is 255. That's crazy.
I mean, that's not going to train at

Okay. What's the actual token value?
Like does this tell us anything?
the location, a feature ID, and a value.

divided by size. So, that's good.
Velocity is not normalized, but

depending what the range is, that might

not be a big deal.
Okay. So, the only thing I'll actually

you the thing that I think you missed.
You normalized in the engine. All right.

That's fine. Then
wait, what the heck does this get? Time
wait, what the heck does this get? Time
of day.
What? What's this dependent on the time?
Why would you not just do that in terms

Okay,
let me think how I want to draw this.
Okay. So here this is why

this is why you have to sort

So this is a neural net. This is going

to map this input vector to some latent
to map this input vector to some latent

via a matrix multiplication. Right? So
this is actually going to be a layer.

a layer that is a big block of weights.

It's probably going to upsample it even,

it's it looks something like this,
it's it looks something like this,
right? This is usually how you draw

layers. And then you get Whoops, that's
layers. And then you get Whoops, that's
a terrible line.
a terrible line.
Not much better.

Okay, so this is linear.
Okay, but this is a matrix. This is made

And the problem with what you've just

So architecturally you're kind of

we use comn nets for this, right?
We'll put like a little conf like this

The reason we don't do this is because

kind of burnt. So, I'm mostly going to
be doing some stuff on meta. I'm going
be doing some stuff on meta. I'm going
to be doing some post-release fixes as
to be doing some post-release fixes as
are needed. Uh like answering support
are needed. Uh like answering support
stuff. And then also, you let me know on
stuff. And then also, you let me know on
net hack. Yeah, cuz we got to do that.
net hack. Next on the list. Cool enough.
Yeah, there's going to be lots to do
Yeah, there's going to be lots to do
though. I mean, the release is is a big
though. I mean, the release is is a big
release.
Yeah, I saw you playing it. Finally beat
Yeah, I saw you playing it. Finally beat
it. I didn't I figured it was endless.
it. I didn't I figured it was endless.
Cool.
Cool.
I uh I recently I downloaded Overwatch.
I uh I recently I downloaded Overwatch.
I played like two games. Was like, "All
I played like two games. Was like, "All
right, I can't aim. I'm not going to
right, I can't aim. I'm not going to
play enough of this for it to even be
play enough of this for it to even be
fun." And I just like, you know, closed
fun." And I just like, you know, closed
it instantly.
That's not every FPS. There are
That's not every FPS. There are
definitely ones where it's very easy to
definitely ones where it's very easy to
aim.
Constant upkeep. Yeah,
Constant upkeep. Yeah,
I can't pay that at the moment, man.
I can't pay that at the moment, man.
It's like I can't I can't be doing that.
It's like I can't I can't be doing that.
is like, eh,
is like, eh,
it's like literally, okay, think about
it's like literally, okay, think about
this, Orion. There is way more upkeep on
this, Orion. There is way more upkeep on
like being decent at FPS at FPS games
like being decent at FPS at FPS games
than there is on staying jacked.
Just play Reaper or Reinhardt. Yeah, cuz
Just play Reaper or Reinhardt. Yeah, cuz
tracking fire strikes is definitely
tracking fire strikes is definitely
super easy.
I disagree with that. I'm telling you.
I mean, literally like this is this is
I mean, literally like this is this is
all I got to do to keep the deadlift.
Do that once in a while and you're good.
I'll infer it was like six plates. Nah,
I'll infer it was like six plates. Nah,
you get like 335 on it,
you get like 335 on it,
which I think is decent for doing for
which I think is decent for doing for
just like lifting it cold, right?
The other day I had to move it. Like
The other day I had to move it. Like
there were some electricians here, so I
there were some electricians here, so I
had to move it and I had I think 325 on
had to move it and I had I think 325 on
it. So, you know, I had to like pick the
it. So, you know, I had to like pick the
thing up, turn it 90°, walk over the
thing up, turn it 90°, walk over the
step, and then put it down on the other
step, and then put it down on the other
side,
side,
which is like, you know, that's about
which is like, you know, that's about
how light it has to be for you to be
how light it has to be for you to be
able to do it cold safely.
I probably can't do four four plates at
I probably can't do four four plates at
the moment because I haven't done I
the moment because I haven't done I
haven't lifted anything heavy in a
haven't lifted anything heavy in a
while, but it's probably not that far
while, but it's probably not that far
off.
They're
probably not that far off.
So, Ryan, uh, cardio takes a is a pain

Cardio sucks. That I will give you.

I don't think you get limited by time as

Cardio just beat you up a ton.
Yeah, cardio just beats the hell out of

Done with job search. Getting back to

Very good. I assume that means you have
Very good. I assume that means you have
some decision.
If so, congrats.
I'd be interested to hear about that.
I'd be interested to hear about that.
Painful to start. Yeah. The main thing
Painful to start. Yeah. The main thing
is don't go ham on the don't go ham

lifting too heavy and getting yourself
lifting too heavy and getting yourself
hurt. I got to tell you, the injuries
hurt. I got to tell you, the injuries
just suck.

Joining Jeff's lab.
Joining Jeff's lab.
Yo, congrats, man.
Yo, congrats, man.
Big congrats to you.
Big congrats to you.
Then we definitely have all sorts of
Then we definitely have all sorts of
cool research to collab on.
I don't know how much Jeff is still into
I don't know how much Jeff is still into
this stuff, but um for the record, I
this stuff, but um for the record, I
think that actually artificial life,
think that actually artificial life,
like pure evolutionary a life stuff, we
like pure evolutionary a life stuff, we
could actually make it work now training
could actually make it work now training
at 10 million steps per second.
at 10 million steps per second.
So that's a thing that's on the books.
I actually know how to do it as well,
I actually know how to do it as well,
which is kind of cool. I also know how
which is kind of cool. I also know how
to fix all the crazy cursed multi-agent
to fix all the crazy cursed multi-agent
stuff that didn't work in 2018 and 2019.
So, there's lots of stuff we can do. And
So, there's lots of stuff we can do. And
given that you're uh you do a little bit
given that you're uh you do a little bit
more well, I guess you said you want to
more well, I guess you said you want to
do more science side stuff, but the
do more science side stuff, but the
edgeheavy stuff opens a lot of doors in
edgeheavy stuff opens a lot of doors in
research these days.
research these days.
Net hack stuff is also good. Just make
Net hack stuff is also good. Just make
it fast, man. If we make if we just get
it fast, man. If we make if we just get
net hack fast, I think it's good. All
net hack fast, I think it's good. All
you need just make it fast and we'll be
you need just make it fast and we'll be
good.
All right, I'm supposed to be doing a
All right, I'm supposed to be doing a

Net hack for this summer. I think if we
Net hack for this summer. I think if we
can get it like decently quick, then
can get it like decently quick, then
you'll start to see results.
you'll start to see results.
make number go down.

We had this whole like spat back and
We had this whole like spat back and
forth with support on these tiny boxes

because I was so mad at the way

that they were like I couldn't get them
that they were like I couldn't get them
unassembled to m to maintain them and it
unassembled to m to maintain them and it
took me like two days but eventually it
took me like two days but eventually it
was just it was a bad power cable. So I
was just it was a bad power cable. So I
had to replace a power cable and then
had to replace a power cable and then
they worked

and took me two days replace a power

I was so mad over that. Oh my
I was so mad over that. Oh my
god. I was like I was livid over that.

I was like, I'm done. I'm retiring to

the mountains in Siberia and hurting
the mountains in Siberia and hurting
goats. All right. I'm never touching
goats. All right. I'm never touching
another computer. I was so mad. Yeah,
another computer. I was so mad. Yeah,
GPU is fine. It was just a cable.
That was like
my goal for the next six months, all
my goal for the next six months, all
right, is to make Puffer is to grow
right, is to make Puffer is to grow
Puffer as a company
Puffer as a company
so we actually can support all this
so we actually can support all this
research uh at larger scale and to not
research uh at larger scale and to not
deal with as much crazy which
deal with as much crazy which
I say as I'm dealing with crazy
I say as I'm dealing with crazy
but it's aspirational.
Where's this config thing that I was

So, the only thing I could think of
So, the only thing I could think of
and that we got to try this before we

try anything else, right?
That's interesting.
That's interesting.
We'll see whether that's just um the
We'll see whether that's just um the
initial stuff though.
It does help with logging frequency

I'm going to hop on a call with uh with

David in a bit about meta.
Hopefully, we get him some results by

But yeah, the plan is to pretty much

just be streaming uh stuff all week and
just be streaming uh stuff all week and
we're going to be doing a few things on
we're going to be doing a few things on
meta this week. We're going to be doing

obviously any sort of fixes that we need
obviously any sort of fixes that we need
to make for post3 release, but then the
to make for post3 release, but then the
cool new stuff that we're going to be
cool new stuff that we're going to be
starting on is going to be uh drone
starting on is going to be uh drone
stuff. So, we've got like this massive
stuff. So, we've got like this massive
uh battle environment with all the
uh battle environment with all the
drones, and I'm going to probably try to
drones, and I'm going to probably try to
get that into a state where you actually
get that into a state where you actually
have like coordinated team behavior and
have like coordinated team behavior and
such.
Welcome.
We have anybody yelling at me over
We have anybody yelling at me over
broken stuff in Puffer yet?
Nope.
few follows

ending 9 to5.
I'm going to be here another 20 minutes
I'm going to be here another 20 minutes
or so. So, you can get your RL questions
or so. So, you can get your RL questions
in.
Yeah. So, this is weird.
Yeah. So, this is weird.
Let's
kind of weird pattern.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
Not super optimized to be fair.
Can we dispense with log only on
Can we dispense with log only on
terminal?
What
What
we have um
the same as your purple line?
the same as your purple line?
Yeah, it's just it's sampled at a
Yeah, it's just it's sampled at a
different frequency and I don't it's
different frequency and I don't it's
also like there could be differences in
also like there could be differences in
learning based on this. So I don't want
learning based on this. So I don't want
to like commit to this until I I know
to like commit to this until I I know
it's decent.
We should probably also just run this
We should probably also just run this
for longer, huh? See what it does.
I can set this up to run. Uh,
I can set this up to run. Uh,
let me do that real quick.
let me do that real quick.
while I can here.
Don't know why it keeps prompting me for
for that.
for that.
All right. So
for was it
Huh?
Huh?
Oh, that just went and got puffer lip 3,

which is kind of interesting.
since we do have a fair few folks

We did have our big release today

Star the puffer. You eat stars. In fact,

I tried to get people to star the puffer
I tried to get people to star the puffer
so much that I even made a tutorial

I don't know what else I can do, but
I don't know what else I can do, but
there you go.
there you go.
You can uh read through the docs and
You can uh read through the docs and
literally build this environment.
What the heck?
How could you tell?
What do you see?
What do you see?
What do you see for feature selection
for observation space?
Um,
Um,
I mean it depends on your problem
I mean it depends on your problem
literally like all you really want to do
literally like all you really want to do
is just think about what information the
is just think about what information the
agent needs to solve the problem and

then normalize it reasonably. So like

We're going to have to do the uh put the
We're going to have to do the uh put the
new container on this machine at some
new container on this machine at some
point soon.
Oh, they're doing this
box six status. Forgot to call again.
Maybe tomorrow
that back to me.
Okay. No CUDA GPUs are available.
Okay. No CUDA GPUs are available.
Lovely.
This hands.
A billion steps.
Okay, five hour run.
Okay, five hour run.
We'll see how that goes.
In the meantime, let's figure out why
In the meantime, let's figure out why
it's so damn slow.
We do that real quick.
Yeah. So this runs
See
what that does.
Okay. So, a reset
is 100 times slower than a step.
And do we have episode length?
So 25k
times Is it 24 agents? Probably
500k.
I mean, that should be mostly
I mean, that should be mostly
reasonable. No.
Oh, and that also includes resets. This
Oh, and that also includes resets. This
includes the resets.
I mean, that seems like it should be
I mean, that seems like it should be
fast enough over 16 cores completely.
fast enough over 16 cores completely.
Something is getting in the way of this.
Okay.
Well, there's their uh
Well, there's their uh
better result just off the analing
better result just off the analing
Right.
would be the observation eyes.
No, it's 128 by 3.
We do. So I said make
We do. So I said make
this gives us Meta puff.
So, how is that the case then? That uh
So, how is that the case then? That uh
when I have 16 environments, it's super
when I have 16 environments, it's super
slow.
slow.
Do I not have enough parkour or
Do I not have enough parkour or
something?
All right, I got to go, guys, because I

We have to add grid.
Very cool. Thank you. Let me actually
Very cool. Thank you. Let me actually
just get this onto the um
just get this onto the um
the Pi Pi repo.

I think. Well, let's push it first.
Oh, I know what happened.

You kind of just have to build something
You kind of just have to build something
really good and then show it off online

publicly and then oftentimes good things

I mean, we have all sorts of articles

lined up that we'll be releasing all

throughout the week as well.
I'm trying to think what other stuff I
I'm trying to think what other stuff I
I'm likely to need to fix. I technically
I'm likely to need to fix. I technically
did forget to put the grid environment
did forget to put the grid environment
on the website, didn't I? And that's
on the website, didn't I? And that's
like a really cool environment. So, I
like a really cool environment. So, I
think we'll do that live and then
think we'll do that live and then
that'll show people the process of like
that'll show people the process of like
running a net and see.

took a lot of work. Uh it's not solved
took a lot of work. Uh it's not solved
in the sense that like there's a massive

I literally wrote this article just so I

There you go. I'm only half joking.
Got him.
That article didn't do super well, but I

kind of like it.
Okay, so it's five actions.
There's five actions.
And then the ob size is 2 * vision

Okay. So, here we're exporting the

pre-trained weights. This is the number

And then what we're going to do,
we're going to make a folder for uh this
we're going to make a folder for uh this
new grid. this grid environment and then
new grid. this grid environment and then
we will copy
that into there. And now we're going to

be able to load it from C. Created the

Actually, I want to do that real quick

cuz it's a cool environment.
All right,
I will show how this uh this logic
I will show how this uh this logic
actually works. Let me just get the uh
actually works. Let me just get the uh
the boiler plate into place first, which
the boiler plate into place first, which
is where the model actually
or where we put the model in, which is
or where we put the model in, which is
we actually just do it like this.
And then
one agent.
one agent.
I don't know the D type of observations.
Ah, it's unsigned char. So, we actually
Ah, it's unsigned char. So, we actually
have to copy it. See, good thing I kept
have to copy it. See, good thing I kept
I uh I caught that.
So there is a thing where you can just
So there is a thing where you can just
use the observations directly. I think
use the observations directly. I think
it messes up if you don't copy them over
it messes up if you don't copy them over
though because of the dtype.
Then I will explain in a second how this
Then I will explain in a second how this
works.
It's ops, not observations.
Okay. So,
I also have to include a net.h
Okay.
Okay.
Does this work?
Uh, no it does not.
Cool.
Cool.
So, we'll have to figure out why this
So, we'll have to figure out why this
doesn't actually work here.
Oh, cuz actions is a float.
Oh, cuz actions is a float.
Whoops.
Apparently, I convert this from a I
Apparently, I convert this from a I
convert this to not a float somehow.
I haven't looked at this in a while.
So I'm just mucking something up with
So I'm just mucking something up with
the data, I'm sure.
the data, I'm sure.
So what is supposed to happen here,
So what is supposed to happen here,
right, is that you have this little
right, is that you have this little
linear layer LSTM plus LSTM network
linear layer LSTM plus LSTM network
that's been trained super fast in

This is supposed to be int.
Okay. Except the network is supposed to

This is how it's supposed to look.
Yeah. So, this is how it's supposed to

Okay.
It is discreet at five, right?
Yes.
Yeah, it's not matching at all. Is it
Yeah, it's not matching at all. Is it
actually a linear LSTM?
Oh, I know what's wrong. I'm dumb.
Oh, I know what's wrong. I'm dumb.
Yeah, I know what's wrong.
Yeah, I know what's wrong.
Hey Doctor.

Are you having to zero it every step or

something?
I can take a look at it.
I can take a look at it.
Is the algorithm not supposed to be like
Is the algorithm not supposed to be like
quadratic in tape size or something?
Yeah, but like I don't know the end
Yeah, but like I don't know the end
dynamics enough, right?
Oh, when you say PF, do you mean how
Oh, when you say PF, do you mean how
fast it runs or how well the agent does?
There we go.
There we go.
How well it does. Ah, okay. So, I mean,
How well it does. Ah, okay. So, I mean,
it's probably just cuz it's randomly
it's probably just cuz it's randomly
sampling actions at the start and it can
sampling actions at the start and it can
get stuck.
It's kind of funny that it does this. I

It's decent.
I forget anything else or is that just
I forget anything else or is that just
like the stability that I have with the

That's somewhat disappointing if so.
Let's see if that does anything.
Oh, get stuck in the exact same spot.

And you can tell it's some state thing

Yeah, that's probably it. So, I mean, if

you know the problem doesn't take very
you know the problem doesn't take very

That's a good trick.
You know, I've seen this happen before
You know, I've seen this happen before
in the actual end as well.
I wonder if we're actually hitting a a
I wonder if we're actually hitting a a
fault of some type
here. We'll see if we hit a fault. Now,
here. We'll see if we hit a fault. Now,
we do not had any fault. So, I mean,
we do not had any fault. So, I mean,
this says it's not some memory
this says it's not some memory
corruption.
I've seen this happen in the actual eval
I've seen this happen in the actual eval
as well, though it's a lot less common
as well, though it's a lot less common
than I just saw.

I mean this says we zero it, right?
To be fair, it is kind of janky the way
To be fair, it is kind of janky the way
we're doing the policy.
I didn't miss anything. I don't think

policy recurrent.
Yeah, I don't think I missed anything.
Yeah, I don't think I missed anything.
[Music]
I guess it's because we don't sample.
I guess we need the randomness of the
I guess we need the randomness of the
sampling, huh? But the thing is like I
sampling, huh? But the thing is like I
don't Do I believe that? Because if it
don't Do I believe that? Because if it
were just the randomness of the
were just the randomness of the
sampling, right, I'd be able to like
sampling, right, I'd be able to like
like I can move it here and like it
like I can move it here and like it
should recover.
I mean, I guess it it kind of does.
I mean, I guess it it kind of does.
Oh, yeah, it does.
Okay. So, it's relying on the randomness
Okay. So, it's relying on the randomness
of the policy. That's what it is. So, we
of the policy. That's what it is. So, we
need to add the randomness back in.
Oh no, but it is random here, isn't it?
Oh no, but it is random here, isn't it?
It's not discreet. It's not a a fixed
It's not discreet. It's not a a fixed
sample. It is actually a random sample.
That's pretty irritating.
I mean the quick fix here for Yes.
This is a quick fix.
Ah, I mean, the fact that this doesn't
Ah, I mean, the fact that this doesn't
work tells you something's totally
work tells you something's totally
wrong.
I guess discretise is false.
This doesn't do anything.
Oh, cuz it we just set it to true.
Oh, cuz it we just set it to true.
That's fine then.
Okay. So, let's see why
why this would uh would happen.
I think there is actually a bug here.
Maybe this explains why we don't have
Maybe this explains why we don't have
perfect maze solving agents.

We'll see how well this does.
And then the other PR is something as

anything weird.
Yeah, I can go in. I'm just making sure
Yeah, I can go in. I'm just making sure
nothing's screwed up.
Cool. There we go.
That grid environment is actually going
That grid environment is actually going
to take more work.
I kind of don't want to mess with it and
I kind of don't want to mess with it and
mess up the uh the current dynamics just

I will uh I will give shout outs to at

something reasonable.
But after uh after launch Okay.
drone also has new PR. Okay, let's see.
drone also has new PR. Okay, let's see.
Let's take a look at that.
Rings will definitely be cool.
Make sure
A little bit fast, don't you think?
That's only 60 fps. Why is it that fast?
Is it because of like mcript and stuff?
What the heck?
That's not the web build.
Why is it run Why is it rendering that
Why is it run Why is it rendering that
fast locally? It's only set to 60 fps.
Yeah, we think it's that
looks fine in Eval, but looks fine in E.
looks fine in Eval, but looks fine in E.
How can it look fine in Eval?
So, this is not the web build.
Huh?
Huh?
What
now? Something is not right here.
OB
size needs changing.
Hang on.
Train this real quick.
the 95%. All right.
Is it supposed to be green on one side,
Is it supposed to be green on one side,
blue on the other?
That looks pretty freaking cool.
Uh, it's cuz it has to show you what
Uh, it's cuz it has to show you what
direction
direction
to go through them.
to go through them.
Okay.
Okay. So, there's a render glitch
Okay. So, there's a render glitch
because this should not be happening
because this should not be happening
here. Yeah,
the speed is wrong. Like the drone
the speed is wrong. Like the drone
itself is too fast
cuz it's it's going in sharp angles.
What are max rings and max moves
What are max rings and max moves
supposed to be?
There we are. Yes. So, if you don't set
There we are. Yes. So, if you don't set
those, chaos ensues.
working on it.
There we go.
The heck? They should not be asking me
The heck? They should not be asking me
for credentials.
Hang on.
Okay, that should show up on the website
Okay, that should show up on the website
in a minute.
in a minute.
It takes uh GitHub a little bit just to
It takes uh GitHub a little bit just to
push a new
push a new
update even though it's like static.
Cool.
Let's see if drone's online.
Welcome major.
Oh yeah.
What's the next plan for drone then?
What's the next plan for drone then?
Trying to think how we uh how do we turn
Trying to think how we uh how do we turn
this into
I'm trying to think how we turn like get
I'm trying to think how we turn like get
from here to like champion drone racing,
from here to like champion drone racing,
right?
How do you generate where the rings are?
How do you generate where the rings are?
Are the rings random or is there some
Are the rings random or is there some
pattern to them?
Brother, how you got into MIT?
Uh, in order to get into a PhD, the best
Uh, in order to get into a PhD, the best
thing to have done is to already have
thing to have done is to already have
done half of a PhD. So, I pretty much
done half of a PhD. So, I pretty much
did that
random for now. Cool. Yeah. So, the
random for now. Cool. Yeah. So, the
thing I was thinking of, I don't know
thing I was thinking of, I don't know
how they actually set the courses.
how they actually set the courses.
Um,
I don't know if here I Let me show you
I don't know if here I Let me show you
what I was thinking.
what I was thinking.
Let me get my coffee first and then
Let me get my coffee first and then
we'll talk about what we can do with
we'll talk about what we can do with
drones.
Bezier, your curves were fine. Yeah, so
Bezier, your curves were fine. Yeah, so
that's what I was thinking.
I should have specified coffee and set.
The gym equipment is not just for show.
Oh yeah. You probably can't even see
Oh yeah. You probably can't even see
half of it anymore with the freaking
half of it anymore with the freaking
chair in the background. Yeah.
So this is not what I meant.
What do they use to generate racetracks?
What do they use to generate racetracks?
Right.
Maybe something like this.
And then you do the same thing like
And then you do the same thing like
height displaced as well
height displaced as well
cuz it's a drone.
Welcome folks.
This is the uh release day. Fixing
This is the uh release day. Fixing
things, merging things, and answering
things, merging things, and answering
questions on release.
I'll have a look around.
I'll have a look around.
Yeah, I think we should be a like if we
Yeah, I think we should be a like if we
get it to do a reasonable track. Now, I
get it to do a reasonable track. Now, I
actually don't know how well that fits
actually don't know how well that fits
because if you look up like Champion,
like isn't this the tracks are kind of
like isn't this the tracks are kind of
crazy, right?
Yeah. Like they don't really follow
Ah, okay. So, you see how the um
Ah, okay. So, you see how the um
like the borders of the targets are
like the borders of the targets are
specifically made for them to be easy to
specifically made for them to be easy to
track. So, it's just like some really
track. So, it's just like some really
basic state estimation stuff.
And then uh neural nets
And then uh neural nets
vio. Yeah. So it's not
vio. Yeah. So it's not
we can totally do something like this
we can totally do something like this
like this is just open CV running
like this is just open CV running
basically
they actually tell you how they do their
they actually tell you how they do their
physics as well
right there.
So, yeah, we could totally do something
So, yeah, we could totally do something
like this, right?
drone would be cool.
Scanning technique
Scanning technique
work with lidar camera. Do you need
work with lidar camera. Do you need
lidar?
lidar?
I don't think you need lidar.
I guess it kind of depends because like
I guess it kind of depends because like
they do they paint the targets to make
they do they paint the targets to make
them easier to do perception on, right?
I think also like they've got to have an
I think also like they've got to have an
order to the loops.
order to the loops.
So, it'll probably be something like 10
So, it'll probably be something like 10
hoops and like they're just in order in
hoops and like they're just in order in
the observations.
the observations.
We only use LAR cuz iPhones have one.
We only use LAR cuz iPhones have one.
Oh,
Oh,
you probably don't want to stick an
you probably don't want to stick an
iPhone on a drone. Okay.
But hey, look. I mean, it's on the
But hey, look. I mean, it's on the
website at least.
Yeah, I would think probably some sort
Yeah, I would think probably some sort
of like
it definitely has to be like larger
it definitely has to be like larger
scale, right? We'd want to see like a
scale, right? We'd want to see like a
larger area that it's flying over with
larger area that it's flying over with
more hoops that are like connected in
more hoops that are like connected in
some sort of sane way.
some sort of sane way.
probably numbered as well
because it shouldn't just be observing
because it shouldn't just be observing
like all the hoops. It should also have
like all the hoops. It should also have
them in order, right?
Does it get penalized for hitting the uh
Does it get penalized for hitting the uh
the rim at the moment?
All the groundwork should be there.
All the groundwork should be there.
Yeah. I think the only thing that's
Yeah. I think the only thing that's
going to be tricky is figuring out how
going to be tricky is figuring out how
to not spend forever on perception,
to not spend forever on perception,
right? To run it on a real drone.
Yes, they collide. Okay, cool.
Yes, they collide. Okay, cool.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, this is a pretty
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, this is a pretty
darn solid start, Oh,
I wonder if there's some basic thing we
I wonder if there's some basic thing we
can do where like even before we deal
can do where like even before we deal
with the perception part,
with the perception part,
can we just like see if this can fly a
can we just like see if this can fly a
drone from like point to point or stuff?
We rescan their route and do a three.
We rescan their route and do a three.
Oh, I see.
Not attached to the drone. I Okay, I
Not attached to the drone. I Okay, I
see.
We'll have to figure out what drones
We'll have to figure out what drones
would be like good to play with.
would be like good to play with.
So, I mean, getting it working in the
So, I mean, getting it working in the
real world for sure. And then the other
real world for sure. And then the other
question I have is like what's like the
question I have is like what's like the
most agile form factor we could get for
most agile form factor we could get for
a drone? Because even if it's something
a drone? Because even if it's something
that's incredibly difficult for a human
that's incredibly difficult for a human
to fly, we can probably just do it with
to fly, we can probably just do it with
RL easily, All right.

Okay.
Okay.
Those
look cool.
Okay, so they make these super high-end
Okay, so they make these super high-end

which we could get.
Yeah, it's kind of obnoxious.
They've discontinued all their consumer
They've discontinued all their consumer
drones as well.

anymore?
I mean, straight up, like all the ones
I mean, straight up, like all the ones
that I knew in RL left. Like, they all

got sick of dealing with it and left.

Forers's lab. Uh, but there are very few
people left actually working on the core

the fact that there's been basically no

Okay.
Only other thing I can think of is the

I don't think it's going to work out for

I mean, the thing that they released

lately was cool, but it was literally a

Haha. Because it was like the slowest

really any more interesting. Like,

You've just made it way slower. So, like
You've just made it way slower. So, like
it's cool that you can get it to work,
but like you're just going to make
but like you're just going to make
everything super slow.
We make everything super fast.
All right, let's go check a look at
All right, let's go check a look at
meta.
meta.
Here's what we're going to do.
I'm going to I'm going to sync this fork
I'm going to I'm going to sync this fork
now and then I'm not going to sync it
now and then I'm not going to sync it
again
again
until we have it working because they
until we have it working because they
132 commits in the last week. Get out of
132 commits in the last week. Get out of
here.
Let me show off what this is actually
Let me show off what this is actually
before we uh we just start working on it
before we uh we just start working on it
so people can get an idea because I
so people can get an idea because I
promised these guys I would help them a
promised these guys I would help them a
little bit on this once we have the
little bit on this once we have the
release done. Um so I think we're going
release done. Um so I think we're going
to just start on on that. So meta
to just start on on that. So meta
is this pretty cool environment. It
is this pretty cool environment. It
looks like this.
looks like this.
It's kind of like a factory env in a
It's kind of like a factory env in a
sense where like there are different

resources you have to collect and then
resources you have to collect and then
move them to different collectors and
move them to different collectors and
converters and things. See you Sam.
So uh yeah, let's see what we can do
So uh yeah, let's see what we can do
about this.
Okay, we'll see what that does.

We're going to have to get pretty deep

instead of giving me instead of saying

can you tell me what is like what is the

like if you treat this like rlib and

you're expecting like something like
you're expecting like something like
rlib gives you you're just going to have

a bad time because it's not rlib. But
like the thing that you need is not like
like the thing that you need is not like
an RLIB style tutorial. It's like it's

to not treat this like RLIB because it's
to not treat this like RLIB because it's
completely different. Like the core
completely different. Like the core
design philosophies are basically

diametrically opposed.
diametrically opposed.
Like you pretty much can't find a

farther apart library than RLIB from
farther apart library than RLIB from
what we built.
The point is not like RL lib but good,
The point is not like RL lib but good,
right? It's like
right? It's like
it's more like clean RL but faster and
it's more like clean RL but faster and
flexible. Not RLI but good.
What is this?
I mean, we have examples. This is
I mean, we have examples. This is
already more overbuilt than something
already more overbuilt than something
that we need, though. There's literally
that we need, though. There's literally
not this much stuff in Puffer Lib that
not this much stuff in Puffer Lib that
you need to do.
Like we've had stuff like this before
Like we've had stuff like this before
and it was a pain in the ass to maintain
and it was a pain in the ass to maintain
it and like nobody really liked it
it and like nobody really liked it

Like we have them all in pure code here.

Like turning these into like turning
Like turning these into like turning
these into mini blog posts each does not
these into mini blog posts each does not
sound particularly fun.
So I' I'd rather you tell me like where
So I' I'd rather you tell me like where
you're confused about stuff rather than
you're confused about stuff rather than
saying can we build something like this
saying can we build something like this
because like I kind of hate this
because like I kind of hate this
frankly.
So like I will absolutely make stuff
So like I will absolutely make stuff
easier, right? And I will like listen to
easier, right? And I will like listen to

smooth in animations when you actually
smooth in animations when you actually
render the game. That's one way to do
render the game. That's one way to do
it. The other way is to just do frame

fast enough to just do frame skip and
fast enough to just do frame skip and
match the other arcade MS. So that's

probably what I would do.
We do it the other way around for like

architecturally you need to do that?
Okay, we're going to explain a thing

real quick. This is useful for folks
real quick. This is useful for folks

Okay,
let me think how I want to draw this.
Okay. So here this is why

So this is a neural net. This is going

to map this input vector to some latent
to map this input vector to some latent

via a matrix multiplication. Right? So
via a matrix multiplication. Right? So
this is actually going to be a layer.
this is actually going to be a layer.
a layer that is a big block of weights.

It's probably going to upsample it even,

it's it looks something like this,
it's it looks something like this,
right? This is usually how you draw

Not much better.

Okay, so this is linear.
Okay, but this is a matrix. This is made

And the problem with what you've just

is that this matrix has to learn

essentially a mapping of this coordinate

Okay? And then guess what happens?

Even though you would like this to be,

let's not use that color. Uh, let's not

So,
So,
even though you would like this to be

Okay? So, you want it to learn the same
Okay? So, you want it to learn the same

that.
that.
So architecturally you're kind of
So architecturally you're kind of
screwed from this. But if you sort them
screwed from this. But if you sort them
at the very least you are always going
at the very least you are always going
to apply the same transformation to the
to apply the same transformation to the
closest point and then this another

transformation to the second closest

you're going to get something
you're going to get something

It's not that like it needs to resemble

technically look if I were to just

This is fine. Oops. This is 100% fine.
This is fine. Oops. This is 100% fine.
Do you see why? Because this
Do you see why? Because this
transformation, it's like a 2 by n
transformation, it's like a 2 by n
matrix and it's going to apply the exact

we use comn nets for this, right?
We'll put like a little conf like this

The reason we don't do this is because

How do you feed observation spaces? We
How do you feed observation spaces? We
have several environments with

Let's say data coming uses streams

Um,
Um,
so really high-res temporal data is

generally not a fun thing to deal with,
generally not a fun thing to deal with,
but it kind of depends what you mean by

that, right? So like you can subsample
that, right? So like you can subsample
it if you're dealing with like a game.
it if you're dealing with like a game.
Um, if you're dealing with like a
Um, if you're dealing with like a
control sim, you can still subsample it
control sim, you can still subsample it
pretty often times. Um,
pretty often times. Um,
and then if you can't, uh, an LSTM will

get you a decent chunk of the way there.

But if it's like a really really high

Do you think making a box

Generally, before you start messing with

anything algorithmically, you want to
anything algorithmically, you want to
throw it at Puffer Lib, get reasonable
throw it at Puffer Lib, get reasonable
observations and rewards, and run a

how hard your problem is compared to the
how hard your problem is compared to the
problems that we've solved without doing

complicated than one of the problems
complicated than one of the problems
we've solved quite simply then probably
we've solved quite simply then probably
there's something wrong with the data.
there's something wrong with the data.
That's like your good first sanity check
because we can solve a lot of problems
because we can solve a lot of problems
just out of the box nowadays.
Ask puffer live
data is LAR data. Ah then you actually
data is LAR data. Ah then you actually
need point encoders.
need point encoders.
So
So
you actually do need pointwise encoders.
you actually do need pointwise encoders.
So,
So,
where is it?
where is it?
I just drew it like a few I drew it
I just drew it like a few I drew it
earlier.

Yeah, this thing.
Yeah, this thing.
So, if you scroll back in the stream
So, if you scroll back in the stream
half hour or whatever to when this was
half hour or whatever to when this was
on the screen, I explain how to do like
on the screen, I explain how to do like
point encoders. You need a point encoder

for LiDAR. You can't do this sorted

going to be slower than our other

either have to uh wait for me to write a

No, you don't need to you don't need to
No, you don't need to you don't need to

Yeah, your ship doesn't I mean well

first of all you're not actually going
first of all you're not actually going
to use that thing for training whatever

the thing is that you build. Uh I would

hope you can just be using that for

actually training neural nets is is
actually training neural nets is is
insane. You can use it for development
insane. You can use it for development
and like puffer is kind of fast enough

that you can use it for simple problems
that you can use it for simple problems
but like you really want GPUs longer

Apparently this is.
Okay. Apparently the insane thing
Okay,
that's float 32 data.
Puffer optimized for metal. Nope. But uh
Puffer optimized for metal. Nope. But uh
I mean puffer very fast, so
I mean puffer very fast, so
it'll probably be pretty decent just out
it'll probably be pretty decent just out
of the box anyways.
like our environments run fast and our
like our environments run fast and our
training is optimized for big batches
training is optimized for big batches
and it's very low overhead. So,
and it's very low overhead. So,
you'll probably lose some perf to the uh
you'll probably lose some perf to the uh
advantage kernel if you don't have the
advantage kernel if you don't have the
CUDA version, but there's still like a
CUDA version, but there's still like a
pretty good C version that we ship.
What did I mess up?
Oh, I guess we don't need the permute

I disagree with that. I'm telling you.
I mean, literally like this is this is

Do that once in a while and you're good.
I'll infer it was like six plates. Nah,
I'll infer it was like six plates. Nah,
you get like 335 on it,
you get like 335 on it,
which I think is decent for doing for

just like lifting it cold, right?
The other day I had to move it. Like

another computer. I was so mad. Yeah,
another computer. I was so mad. Yeah,
GPU is fine. It was just a cable.
That was like
my goal for the next six months, all
my goal for the next six months, all
right, is to make Puffer is to grow

Puffer as a company

research uh at larger scale and to not
research uh at larger scale and to not
deal with as much crazy which

I say as I'm dealing with crazy

but it's aspirational.
Where's this config thing that I was

So, the only thing I could think of
So, the only thing I could think of
and that we got to try this before we

try anything else, right?
That's interesting.
That's interesting.
We'll see whether that's just um the

initial stuff though.
It does help with logging frequency

How does desync episodes work?
I'm going to hop on a call with uh with

David in a bit about meta.
Hopefully, we get him some results by

But yeah, the plan is to pretty much

just be streaming uh stuff all week and

we're going to be doing a few things on

meta this week. We're going to be doing

obviously any sort of fixes that we need

to make for post3 release, but then the
to make for post3 release, but then the
cool new stuff that we're going to be
cool new stuff that we're going to be
starting on is going to be uh drone
starting on is going to be uh drone
stuff. So, we've got like this massive
stuff. So, we've got like this massive
uh battle environment with all the
uh battle environment with all the
drones, and I'm going to probably try to
drones, and I'm going to probably try to
get that into a state where you actually
get that into a state where you actually
have like coordinated team behavior and

such.
Welcome.
We have anybody yelling at me over
We have anybody yelling at me over
broken stuff in Puffer yet?
Nope.
few follows

ending 9 to5.
I'm going to be here another 20 minutes
I'm going to be here another 20 minutes
or so. So, you can get your RL questions
or so. So, you can get your RL questions
in.
Yeah. So, this is weird.
Yeah. So, this is weird.
Let's
kind of weird pattern.
Maybe not.
Maybe not.
Not super optimized to be fair.
Can we dispense with log only on

terminal?
What

we have um
the same as your purple line?

Yeah, it's just it's sampled at a
Yeah, it's just it's sampled at a
different frequency and I don't it's
different frequency and I don't it's
also like there could be differences in

learning based on this. So I don't want
learning based on this. So I don't want
to like commit to this until I I know
to like commit to this until I I know
it's decent.
We should probably also just run this
We should probably also just run this
for longer, huh? See what it does.
I can set this up to run. Uh,
I can set this up to run. Uh,
let me do that real quick.
let me do that real quick.
while I can here.
Don't know why it keeps prompting me for
for that.
for that.
All right. So
for was it
Huh?
Huh?
Oh, that just went and got puffer lip 3,

I don't know what else I can do, but
I don't know what else I can do, but
there you go.
there you go.
You can uh read through the docs and
You can uh read through the docs and
literally build this environment.
What the heck?
How could you tell?
What do you see?
What do you see?
What do you see for feature selection
for observation space?
Um,
Um,
I mean it depends on your problem
I mean it depends on your problem
literally like all you really want to do

is just think about what information the

We're going to have to do the uh put the
We're going to have to do the uh put the
new container on this machine at some
new container on this machine at some
point soon.
Oh, they're doing this
box six status. Forgot to call again.
Maybe tomorrow
that back to me.
Okay. No CUDA GPUs are available.
Okay. No CUDA GPUs are available.
Lovely.
This hands.
A billion steps.
Okay, five hour run.
Okay, five hour run.
We'll see how that goes.
In the meantime, let's figure out why
In the meantime, let's figure out why
it's so damn slow.
We do that real quick.
Yeah. So this runs
See
what that does.
Okay. So, a reset
is 100 times slower than a step.
And do we have episode length?
So 25k
times Is it 24 agents? Probably
500k.
I mean, that should be mostly
I mean, that should be mostly
reasonable. No.
Oh, and that also includes resets. This

includes the resets.
I mean, that seems like it should be

fast enough over 16 cores completely.
fast enough over 16 cores completely.
Something is getting in the way of this.
Okay.
Well, there's their uh
Well, there's their uh
better result just off the analing

would be the observation eyes.
No, it's 128 by 3.
We do. So I said make

this gives us Meta puff.
So, how is that the case then? That uh

when I have 16 environments, it's super

slow.
slow.
Do I not have enough parkour or
