anything. It definitely trains in fewer
steps than Adam. Okay, that's something
steps than Adam. Okay, that's something
then.
me open up
me open up
uh term in the

enough runs from this.
Uh, so that's
Uh, so that's
actually Yeah, Dian's not doing anything
actually Yeah, Dian's not doing anything
here. Okay, that's unfortunate.
here. Okay, that's unfortunate.
So then how is it that
um I'm confused as to
how something's weird here for
I was about to like add this to neural
I was about to like add this to neural
MMO 3, but now it's like
It shouldn't be meaningfully increasing
It shouldn't be meaningfully increasing
the network capacity, right?
I guess. Do you expect this to do more
I guess. Do you expect this to do more
on like maze or
something? which is like a hard
something? which is like a hard
exploration
task. There's something weird here

because it didn't used to do this well.
Yeah. So this is definitely then the
Yeah. So this is definitely then the
same with or without right
This must have just been like a
This must have just been like a
combination of other
factors. Oh well, Oreo is hard. I make
factors. Oh well, Oreo is hard. I make
mistakes once in a

while. Make sure the model size makes

It's really It's supposed to help on

Let's kill this cuz this is obviously

Well, I don't know. I kind of want to

let this one
let this one
run. Let me go get the other box that I

have, which I think is
it. Box

There's our system usage back.
I'm trying to map out what we do
I'm trying to map out what we do
today in my head
here. I have some algo stuff and I have

Okay, that's
screwed. I have to go check on box
screwed. I have to go check on box
six some point
today. Is there anything I can run on
today. Is there anything I can run on
the other box in the meanwhile?
the other box in the meanwhile?
We
We
definitely need to do any of

Actually, I think Kyouung had
Actually, I think Kyouung had
uh some experiments we can use.
Or the last layer.
The hack
Oh, it's kind of weird.
Um, I guess cuz it's a rapper.
So we do
that. It's fine by me.
This just gets us like an extra
