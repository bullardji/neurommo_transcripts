pull. There's siphon for cart pull. So
we keep this one. We get rid of this

that's just it caching, man. That's

Don't worry about that.
Let's
see. Wait.
We do kind of want off white for that,

That took me all five seconds, right? Is
That took me all five seconds, right? Is
there any reason for it to be this large

like reasonable sizes and aspect ratios
so we can put them on the website

this should be
this should be
720p, which is 720 1080. That's the
720p, which is 720 1080. That's the
biggest I go. And then I do like the
biggest I go. And then I do like the
smaller 4x3s often. I mean, some of
smaller 4x3s often. I mean, some of
these are games that have like their own
these are games that have like their own
predefined aspect ratio, but you know,
predefined aspect ratio, but you know,
they're all kind of a reasonable size if
they're all kind of a reasonable size if
you look at

This is 720p as well, right? So, the

uh Oh, you didn't set the optimizer
uh Oh, you didn't set the optimizer

So that's with Muon and

Interesting. All

we'll be working on more stuff. I guess

the only other thing I want to do is

make sure that this run is crashed
make sure that this run is crashed
immediately. Yeah. So, that's down
immediately. Yeah. So, that's down
there. Little different already.
Maybe we'll see if that does anything
useful. Oh,

yeah. It's kind of a weird shape. We'll
