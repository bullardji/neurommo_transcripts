Hey

Not a great policy at

That's funny.
All right. What do we got for uh

It would be really nice if this thing

Nope. Their stuff is just
down. Well, I mean this was the fix
down. Well, I mean this was the fix
though.
I guess then what we do is in the

Yeah, we like try to hunt our sweeps
Yeah, we like try to hunt our sweeps

Maybe I can try that again.
See where my tab

Yeah, that's a good
Yeah, that's a good

I guess the next thing is going to be I
I guess the next thing is going to be I

to get a sweep to run with DDP
to get a sweep to run with DDP
maybe so that
maybe so that
um we can actually sweep taking into

That would be interesting to

I'm looking for like other things in

Mhm. I should probably run a better like
Mhm. I should probably run a better like
attempt at repro on the

again? Okay, Neptune's back

up. So, I can actually probably go look
up. So, I can actually probably go look
for the original now.
Auto.
Auto. Uh,
really? Oh, I guess
really? Oh, I guess
so. Huh?
Well, this is a breakout
one. So, this is
auto. Okay. So, I mean according to
auto. Okay. So, I mean according to
this, this
this, this
is what was run.
Oh, we actually can probably have these
Oh, we actually can probably have these

actually be able to see the tiny boxes
actually be able to see the tiny boxes
in the background. They're really cool.
There's the grid sweep.
I guess the question is going to be if
I guess the question is going to be if
this doesn't repro, what the hell
this doesn't repro, what the hell
happened, right?
This is the one from last night.
Oh, that's why it was down. They were
Oh, that's why it was down. They were
updating the website.
I'm trying to think what else I can do
I'm trying to think what else I can do
in the meantime cuz
in the meantime cuz
like I need to run this experiment for a
while. Start a new M stuff.

I mean these are kind of the two crucial

putting off like just the work of uh
putting off like just the work of uh
figuring out and exporting all the new

that. I think realistically how much

It's kind of just like

put all the new M's
put all the new M's

up. I guess I could technically go do
some detective work on
um on what's happening
here. It's just so weird that this is

single card speed is comparable to any

basically. Like if this repros the
basically. Like if this repros the
sweep, then I'll be able to solve this
sweep, then I'll be able to solve this
issue. If this doesn't repro

though, then what the hell do I do?
What's the contingency plan for if this
What's the contingency plan for if this
doesn't reap
Yeah, but like the sweep repro [ __ ]
Yeah, but like the sweep repro [ __ ]
takes
takes

have a very nice log of

So it's like controlling the number of

eval before eval is important.
But I'm trying to think what like what

is even the error surface, right?

I'm pretty sure this is the same machine
I'm pretty sure this is the same machine
I ran the

If I go to this sweep
our grids made.
They are

before the bet deck ref bug fix.
Which is probably why I have a bunch of
Which is probably why I have a bunch of

Why is this on float

That's fine.

Hold
Hold

five. Oh, no. I just see five.

Okay, the five at 60 bill
Okay, the five at 60 bill
is pretty decent.
Just some meta stuff.
See how this

Huh. Interesting.
Oh, come on. Is this going to actually
All

very similar
very similar
results. Although I think this is

slower if I uh recall. Yeah, this is a
slower if I uh recall. Yeah, this is a
fair bit slower.
It's actually a really big concern if
It's actually a really big concern if
the sweep does still doesn't repro.
Like that would be really major,
Like that would be really major,
wouldn't
wouldn't
it? We need those sweeps. That's like
it? We need those sweeps. That's like
one of the main things for the uh
one of the main things for the uh
results uh of the release.
The only thing I could possibly think
The only thing I could possibly think
of, right, is that I changed some
of, right, is that I changed some
defaults or some like sweep params.
Yeah, but like there's a difference
Yeah, but like there's a difference
between there being a little bit of
between there being a little bit of
variability and like the thing perfectly
variability and like the thing perfectly
solving in less than 100 experiments
solving in less than 100 experiments

We also have results for multiple ends.
We also have results for multiple ends.
There's a difference for at least for

Best thing I can do is just to let this
Best thing I can do is just to let this
thing
run. Yeah, I mean I
can here. We'll do that right here.
You can clearly see it trends
differently. Okay,
differently. Okay,
ready? We'll put these guys
ready? We'll put these guys
here the chat

that

that did not work.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So you can see qualitatively right the

massive difference in these two
massive difference in these two
runs. If I go to our sample view or our

here. Okay. So first of all I mean I
guess this 200 run is like split like
guess this 200 run is like split like
two different runs in here. So whatever
two different runs in here. So whatever
we'll do like this.
Now you can see the

Oh, that's
something. I'm just like messing around

with a few
things pretty much.
I figured I would like mix the um the

does anything.
I don't think anything could have

I was pretty sure

Like these are pretty good. It could be

I just straight up didn't run this for
I just straight up didn't run this for
long enough, you
know, that this just is a slow start and
know, that this just is a slow start and
then it actually works.
then it actually works.
I could believe
that. I mean, it would be it would make
that. I mean, it would be it would make
the most sense to be honest out of
the most sense to be honest out of
anything cuz it would be like absolutely

crazy cursed if this doesn't
crazy cursed if this doesn't
repro. I mean, and then if this does

repro, I should just be able to go and
exactly match all of the hyper pram
exactly match all of the hyper pram
ranges and like be less cavalier about
ranges and like be less cavalier about
it and then that should just run.
That would actually be the best
outcome. I should actually probably

assume that that's the case or at least
assume that that's the case or at least

So once I finish this one meta
So once I finish this one meta
experiment, I should set it up to like

run that sweep confirmation and just be
run that sweep confirmation and just be
very careful about matching
very careful about matching

it. I might just do that for
it. I might just do that for
tonight. Then I'll have pretty much
tonight. Then I'll have pretty much
everything up and running.
Uh, I'm currently rerunning the old
Uh, I'm currently rerunning the old

I Right.
Funny that nothing beats these params.
Yeah, this heart get is like way
better. Yeah. I know we will be able to
better. Yeah. I know we will be able to
beat these as well because
beat these as well because
like I suspect this doesn't correspond
like I suspect this doesn't correspond
to a ridiculously good policy.
It's hard to do objectively best
It's hard to do objectively best
params. Not really a way to do
params. Not really a way to do
that. There's no theory behind any of
that. There's no theory behind any of
this
crap. Like really?
Yeah. I don't
know. You know what I really want to
know. You know what I really want to
work on once we get all the RL stuff
work on once we get all the RL stuff
working? I want to work on RL for
working? I want to work on RL for
sci-fi. Like, how do we use really good
sci-fi. Like, how do we use really good
RL to just make some sci-fi
tech? That's what I want to do.
Like if you were to pick fields, right?
Like if you were to pick fields, right?
Not fields that like you think are super
Not fields that like you think are super
important right now or whatever, but

like if you were to pick like what

Like I actually don't think humanoid
Like I actually don't think humanoid

Is it is it possible to make an

[ __ ] Is that
[ __ ] Is that
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
possible? Hey, now we we actually have
possible? Hey, now we we actually have
the physics PhD here. We have a doctor
the physics PhD here. We have a doctor
of physics here, so we can ask him
of physics here, so we can ask him
stupid sci-fi
questions. Perfect.
Oh, a
Oh, a
physicist.
Like, so so in like the culture novels,
Like, so so in like the culture novels,
right? They've got like antimatter
right? They've got like antimatter
fueled engines for missiles and and

spaceships and [ __ ] Can we just do
that? Make it happen. It's not that
that? Make it happen. It's not that
hard, right?
hard, right?
Totally possible.
Yeah. So, like here's kind of one of the
Yeah. So, like here's kind of one of the
things that
um one of the things that kind of amuses

me and why I'm like I think that you
me and why I'm like I think that you
know probably like 80% of these like

what if this sci-fi like they're
what if this sci-fi like they're
probably stupid but like you got to
probably stupid but like you got to
think about it there's probably zero

people actually
trying ideas are pretty
good. Yeah, that author was crazy as
good. Yeah, that author was crazy as
well. He was like a nutty, but he could
well. He was like a nutty, but he could
write some cool
stuff, you know, like one of the things
stuff, you know, like one of the things
I
I
actually I really appreciated about his
actually I really appreciated about his
stuff was he was actually kind of
self-aware. Yo uh bet did you read use

ridiculously ridiculously leftist idea
ridiculously ridiculously leftist idea
of a like a a fantasy like sci-fi
of a like a a fantasy like sci-fi

enough to put like the you know like you

some people thought that they were soft

yeah so do I. that that scene from the

opening of that book was
opening of that book was
like not only was it really good, it was
like not only was it really good, it was
just also really self-aware in a kind of

antimatter is like you blow up a
antimatter is like you blow up a

Yeah. So like a gram of it is is 10 the

Yeah, it's literally it's more than fat

you just if anybody thinks about this
you just if anybody thinks about this
for like five seconds, right? There is

Like there's no way, right? So
Like there's no way, right? So
like it kind of
like it kind of
is it's like you've almost got nothing

actually let's let's do another like
actually let's let's do another like

more thing.
10 the

I honestly didn't expect this to work
I honestly didn't expect this to work

We just don't have room temperature
We just don't have room temperature

Wait, you Tyler also like the main thing
Wait, you Tyler also like the main thing
is the superconductors, they only work
is the superconductors, they only work
when it's really cold, right? And like
when it's really cold, right? And like
it's freaking absolute zero in

Ah, that's freaking
Ah, that's freaking
cool. They become

So,
it's you have to confine it with
it's you have to confine it with
magnetic
fields. Do you basically you
fields. Do you basically you
need is the idea just that you need
need is the idea just that you need
ridiculously strong magnets and the only
ridiculously strong magnets and the only
way to make ridiculously strong magnets
way to make ridiculously strong magnets
is with really good superconductors.
Is that the
idea? Yes. If you don't want your coils
melting, what if the coils were in
melting, what if the coils were in
freaking
freaking
space, right? Does that
help? Base is really cold.
Cosmic microwave

cool.
Okay. So, your your calcs basically
match match mine,

6. Yeah, that's about
it at a jewel
it at a jewel
range
is Yeah. Like my like dead reckoning
is Yeah. Like my like dead reckoning
based on like no actual knowledge guess
based on like no actual knowledge guess
is like if you accidentally blew up a

rocket it would level like some city
rocket it would level like some city
blocks and if you accidentally well if
blocks and if you accidentally well if
you blew up a nuke you know it leaves
you blew up a nuke you know it leaves
like a mile wide crater or
whatever. Where does then Saturn V? This
whatever. Where does then Saturn V? This

um this is the SpaceX
um this is the SpaceX
one is the the reference for biggest

it a crater is a crater, right?
Isn't that a like irrelevant bet? Cuz
Isn't that a like irrelevant bet? Cuz
like Yeah, like any explosion does that.
like Yeah, like any explosion does that.
The bigger explosion does it more,
right? Or am I dumb?
I mean, that's just saying it's a shock
I mean, that's just saying it's a shock
wave, right? But like, that's literally
wave, right? But like, that's literally
any any
explosive. So, like that's not that's
explosive. So, like that's not that's
not like a meaningful distinction then.
not like a meaningful distinction then.
Yeah.
It's not like, oh, it does more because
It's not like, oh, it does more because
the type. It's cuz it releases more
the type. It's cuz it releases more
energy,
right? Obviously, like ignoring the
right? Obviously, like ignoring the
radiation damage.
Yeah, but like I wasn't even considering
Yeah, but like I wasn't even considering
it for that, right? Like then the point
it for that, right? Like then the point
was not for weaponry. The point was like
was not for weaponry. The point was like
amount of
energy. Like the amount of energy in a
energy. Like the amount of energy in a
nuke is enough to get you into orbit.
Literally, it's actually probably a lot
Literally, it's actually probably a lot
more energy than you need to get you
more energy than you need to get you
into orbit considering it weighs a lot
into orbit considering it weighs a lot
less than a ship,
right? It probably weighs way less than
right? It probably weighs way less than
the rocket as well.
So that's probably enough to get like
So that's probably enough to get like
several of the like actual rocket
several of the like actual rocket

I think that they nowadays they do
I think that they nowadays they do
actually have them that are really
actually have them that are really

he actually knows physics. Do you think
PyTorch treats ops like com 2D and
PyTorch treats ops like com 2D and
basharm 2D and so on as single nodes or

they break them into elementary
they break them into elementary

ops?
Um, it depends on the operation. So like
Um, it depends on the operation. So like
some some operations have fused kernels
some some operations have fused kernels
and some don't.
and some don't.
I would expect that com is pretty
I would expect that com is pretty

right. Will
do. I don't know. One of the things I
do. I don't know. One of the things I
would like to like get a sense of from
would like to like get a sense of from

physically
physically
impossible. What is like probably
impossible. What is like probably
possible? We just don't know how to do

it let you do, right?
Like I can tell you like the holy grail
Like I can tell you like the holy grail
for reinforcement learning, right? Like
for reinforcement learning, right? Like
what does it imply if we solve
what does it imply if we solve
reinforcement learning? It means that
reinforcement learning? It means that
you have a synthetic intelligence that
you have a synthetic intelligence that
is able to learn like like a human would
is able to learn like like a human would
or better um just from any form of

So in a sense solving RL would mean
So in a sense solving RL would mean
solving intelligence itself.
Reinforcement is just one way to learn
Reinforcement is just one way to learn
the solving of RL right the implication
the solving of RL right the implication
right the hypothesis is that it is a

RL there has to be an interaction part

supervised learning
We don't try to shoehorn RL into
We don't try to shoehorn RL into
everything. There has to be some
everything. There has to be some
interactive process. I think we have to
interactive process. I think we have to
solve intelligence first to get sci-fi
solve intelligence first to get sci-fi
applications. Yeah. And that's like the
applications. Yeah. And that's like the
deep mind theory of stuff, right? Which
deep mind theory of stuff, right? Which
is why I work on this as well because
is why I work on this as well because
there are probably some problems that
there are probably some problems that
are AI
are AI

the problem I care most about is the

everything else.
But that one's also probably AI

I don't think there will ever be any

aging. Why
not? I mean, that seems ridiculous.
the biological process. Of course, you
the biological process. Of course, you
can screw with it. We just don't know
can screw with it. We just don't know
how to

right? It actually to me it seems like

it seems impossible that we can't solve
it seems impossible that we can't solve

I'm

and what tech can do for us.
Um, I honestly think like one of the
Um, I honestly think like one of the
crazier beliefs I have is that I think
crazier beliefs I have is that I think
we're literally going to look back on
we're literally going to look back on

Uh I think the problem was that it from

I thought was statistically like diverse

enough I think it actually wasn't and

when I changed the the random seating to

I think you can get it in terms of like
I think you can get it in terms of like
microsconds or at least in a smaller

thing where you'd see a difference

between one process to another when

spawning them. Yeah. Um,
it was no longer hard capped at like 86%
it was no longer hard capped at like 86%
on Perf, you know, I've actually looked
on Perf, you know, I've actually looked
at trying to fix that before, but it's
at trying to fix that before, but it's
kind of obnoxious to get the time in
kind of obnoxious to get the time in
microsconds, right?

Yeah. So, I didn't do it. So, good call.
Yeah. So, I didn't do it. So, good call.
I don't know if it's going to will fully
I don't know if it's going to will fully
solve it, right?
solve it, right?
But I have a new sweep going. It's going
But I have a new sweep going. It's going
to take like a day, right? Cuz it's like
to take like a day, right? Cuz it's like
slow. Um, you know, we might want to
slow. Um, you know, we might want to
just integrate that into endbinding
just integrate that into endbinding
where like we pass a seed in and we make

Yeah, there there's something you could

do there.
do there.
Oh, I another seating thing. Seating was
Oh, I another seating thing. Seating was
also breaking DDP.
also breaking DDP.
Oh, really? Yeah. Seating all the
Oh, really? Yeah. Seating all the
because it was seating all the workers
because it was seating all the workers
the same. breaking DDP. Yeah. The reason
the same. breaking DDP. Yeah. The reason
why I found that was a problem for
why I found that was a problem for
seeding was because when I was doing
seeding was because when I was doing
terraform experiments, the pllin what
terraform experiments, the pllin what
was it? The I was trying to give it a
was it? The I was trying to give it a
random seed with pear and noise and
random seed with pear and noise and
weird somewhere in the sweep it was
weird somewhere in the sweep it was
spawning levels that started at 25%
spawning levels that started at 25%
completion
which meant that there was some
which meant that there was some
percentage of the grouping of levels
percentage of the grouping of levels
that were identical.
that were identical.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah, that makes sense.
And so I applied that solution and then
And so I applied that solution and then
I'm running that. I did a bunch of small
I'm running that. I did a bunch of small
things to um
things to um
Terraform. I added an observation
Terraform. I added an observation
because we didn't have an observation to
because we didn't have an observation to
see its own
see its own
load. And I added a legal action small
load. And I added a legal action small
penalty. I changed a little bit of how
um the delta observation map, you know,
um the delta observation map, you know,
like the second channel of the the conve
like the second channel of the the conve
is

And and then I added a instead of doing
And and then I added a instead of doing
teleportitis via random, I made it if

teleportitis if you're if you're stuck
teleportitis if you're if you're stuck
for a certain period of time.
for a certain period of time.
But if they're all like if they're all
But if they're all like if they're all
like mosh pit in the corner, I that's
like mosh pit in the corner, I that's
the one concern there.
What do you mean? If they're all like
What do you mean? If they're all like
doing like donuts or whatever in like a

little like corner of the map, like

stuff can happen like that where it's
stuff can happen like that where it's
just like
just like
I like I do that in neural MMO because
I like I do that in neural MMO because
like agents can just group up.
like agents can just group up.
Teleportitis is a pretty good hack for
Teleportitis is a pretty good hack for
that.
Maybe I just need to play with the
Maybe I just need to play with the
uh the frequency of it then.
Yeah, but I mean if it works in real
Yeah, but I mean if it works in real
MMO, I guess it probably could work.
MMO, I guess it probably could work.
Well, the thing that's a little tricky
Well, the thing that's a little tricky
with it is um depending on how you treat
with it is um depending on how you treat
your episodes, it can like
your episodes, it can like
cap your score or whatever
cap your score or whatever
uh during train time. So like it's a
uh during train time. So like it's a
little tricky to
configure. Um let's see if there's
configure. Um let's see if there's
anything else that I was trying to get
anything else that I was trying to get
out. I mean hopefully these sweeps just
out. I mean hopefully these sweeps just
work. I'm run the current experiment I'm
work. I'm run the current experiment I'm
running on Terraform is instead of doing

with you. I turned off dilation to one
with you. I turned off dilation to one
because the scoop is one.
because the scoop is one.
Can try it. It's tough because they
Can try it. It's tough because they
can't see very far at all. Then
can't see very far at all. Then
yeah, I mean, they can't see very far,
yeah, I mean, they can't see very far,
but I mean I also constricted the map a
but I mean I also constricted the map a
little
little
bit. And then I changed the reward scale
bit. And then I changed the reward scale
to one because it's only picking up one
to one because it's only picking up one
dirt. But I mean, I'm sweeping reward
dirt. But I mean, I'm sweeping reward
skill, so we'll see what it finds. Yeah.
skill, so we'll see what it finds. Yeah.
And then I dropped dozer capacity
And then I dropped dozer capacity
because it was abusing rewards by just

picking up everything without ever
picking up everything without ever
putting anything down.
Uh I'd already dropped dozer capacity a

it was at 5,000 before, man. All right.
it was at 5,000 before, man. All right.
Well, I made it 10 because it only picks

the old good maze sweep. It got like
the old good maze sweep. It got like
98%.
98%.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You know, actually, this might be
You know, actually, this might be
correct cuz I'm looking at this thing
correct cuz I'm looking at this thing
and this thing is running longer
and this thing is running longer

Maybe this is just like I wake up in the
Maybe this is just like I wake up in the
morning, this repros, and then the other
morning, this repros, and then the other
one is just like, okay, figure out what
one is just like, okay, figure out what
specific hyper prim like sweep settings

it was that was screwing you

No, it's default config stuff. Ah, once

I fix this, it'll fix everything.
Yeah, it's hard to say. I'm facing Yeah,

I'm facing the same issue at the moment.
Hopefully it can be figured out the next

a little fiddly.

to like things I got to do for release,
to like things I got to do for release,
right? like top priority is get sweeps

everything. Uh DDP is a required thing
everything. Uh DDP is a required thing
in this release as well cuz I promised a

client that it would be included. Um and
client that it would be included. Um and
also DDP is just good to have. So we'll
also DDP is just good to have. So we'll
have that in. Uh I got to like you know
have that in. Uh I got to like you know
get all the end baselines, get all the
get all the end baselines, get all the
demos for the site and then we can just
demos for the site and then we can just
ship the Rio pretty much set. Um it's
ship the Rio pretty much set. Um it's
been set. It's just been needing the
been set. It's just been needing the
final experiments like always drag. And
final experiments like always drag. And
then after that, I've got like a couple
then after that, I've got like a couple
things to do on meta, but otherwise
things to do on meta, but otherwise
like I think building some industry
like I think building some industry
sims. Like terraform is definitely one.

Um GPU drive stuff is another. I'm
Um GPU drive stuff is another. I'm
thinking we should do some sort of like
thinking we should do some sort of like
drone stuff just
drone stuff just
because it would be so freaking easy
because it would be so freaking easy
with like this warming capabilities we
with like this warming capabilities we
have. It would be so
easy. Yeah, I don't think there's any
easy. Yeah, I don't think there's any
issue with that. I don't Especially

after seeing target. I mean, ideally,
after seeing target. I mean, ideally,
I'm trying to get GPU drive into 3.0.
I'm trying to get GPU drive into 3.0.
Yeah,
Yeah,
I'm just like at war with resampling for
I'm just like at war with resampling for
like the past like two weeks. Well, I
like the past like two weeks. Well, I
think what we should do is we should
think what we should do is we should
take some of these things that you're
take some of these things that you're
discovering and like try to make them
discovering and like try to make them
harder to screw up. Like we should
harder to screw up. Like we should
probably get seating to be like if you
probably get seating to be like if you
just use the end of binding seating,
just use the end of binding seating,
you'll just never have that bug. Stuff
you'll just never have that bug. Stuff
like that.
It's a good idea.
Yeah, I need to think about some of like
Yeah, I need to think about some of like
the small things I I change here and
the small things I I change here and
there to make things work and see if
there to make things work and see if
those could be helpful in other
those could be helpful in other
environments
cuz there's only so many things that can
cuz there's only so many things that can
go wrong. I feel I feel like this point
go wrong. I feel I feel like this point
I have so much confidence in the RL that
I have so much confidence in the RL that
it's just like something else must be
it's just like something else must be
wrong. Well, it's just like I still
wrong. Well, it's just like I still
break [ __ ] every so often. like when the
break [ __ ] every so often. like when the
sweeps go wrong, that takes confidence
sweeps go wrong, that takes confidence
and stuff, right? Like there's still
and stuff, right? Like there's still
things that need to be tested and
things that need to be tested and
whatnot. It's overall pretty damn good.
whatnot. It's overall pretty damn good.
Yeah, I'd agree. I'd agree.
Yeah. So I think next experiments I mean
Yeah. So I think next experiments I mean
I I think also I want to do like a
I I think also I want to do like a
puffer drive postGPU drive on like a
puffer drive postGPU drive on like a
large scale map.
large scale map.
I think we still have that. Um I haven't
I think we still have that. Um I haven't
heard back from that guy because I know
heard back from that guy because I know
he's back from his trip in Europe but um
he's back from his trip in Europe but um
I think that's something that still
I think that's something that still
probably worth some attention. Yeah. And
probably worth some attention. Yeah. And
any of those could be goodiz things.
and then I'll let you know how my
and then I'll let you know how my
conversation goes with the factory
conversation goes with the factory
people tomorrow.
Yeah, could definitely other than that I
Yeah, could definitely other than that I
mean I think on Terraform I don't think
mean I think on Terraform I don't think
I have too many questions. I mean, right
I have too many questions. I mean, right
now it's just seeing if this random uh

to
to

That's what you think.
That's what you think.
Well, if you do it would have to be like

a grid channel, dude, right?
Are they not like a grid already?
Are they not like a grid already?
They're not technically going to add it
They're not technically going to add it

as another channel to the conf.
Yeah, that's how you do it. You would
Yeah, that's how you do it. You would
have to loop over all the dozer. Yeah.
have to loop over all the dozer. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, I I was trying to find any

other way of doing it beyond that, but I
think I'm stuck with that approach at

because everything else is more

And I don't think it's that bad. Like I
And I don't think it's that bad. Like I
said, as long as I don't put in a

just like it's not amazing, right? Well,
actually, I think that you can make the
actually, I think that you can make the
logic for like updating it in the end
logic for like updating it in the end
code, you can do that millions, no
code, you can do that millions, no
problem. Um yeah I mean I think the only
problem. Um yeah I mean I think the only
reason it's not mega fast in GPU drive
reason it's not mega fast in GPU drive
is the whole observation like being size
is the whole observation like being size
like 4,000. Yes. So that like the thing
like 4,000. Yes. So that like the thing
is it does add bandwidth and also coms
is it does add bandwidth and also coms
are
are
like coms are just not that fast of an
like coms are just not that fast of an
architecture. It turns out they're not.
architecture. It turns out they're not.
Yeah.
Like
Like
honestly, if whenever we can get away
honestly, if whenever we can get away
with it, doing like linear into LSTM or
with it, doing like linear into LSTM or
like MLP into LSTM gets us 2 million
like MLP into LSTM gets us 2 million
step per second training with uh like 2
step per second training with uh like 2
mil
mil
permps, right?
permps, right?
Which is
Which is
like no, we could end up literally doing
like no, we could end up literally doing
10 mil step per second training with a
10 mil step per second training with a
512 hidden
512 hidden
dim on a on a box. Pretty big.
That's only
That's only
like I think Dota like the Dota model is
like I think Dota like the Dota model is
a 4096 hidden dim. Yeah, it was. But do
a 4096 hidden dim. Yeah, it was. But do
they not have any coms?
they not have any coms?
Oh, they have a whole bunch of fancy
Oh, they have a whole bunch of fancy
like sub subnet encoders though. Yeah, I
like sub subnet encoders though. Yeah, I
think they might have had a couple like
think they might have had a couple like
map obs. I forget.
map obs. I forget.
But even then, I mean, their encoders
But even then, I mean, their encoders
weren't that crazy. Their encoders were
weren't that crazy. Their encoders were
incredibly crazy.
incredibly crazy.
This has just been like totally simple,
This has just been like totally simple,
right? Their
right? Their
encod tossed in like regular features in
encod tossed in like regular features in
there. Spencer, do was easy. Go look at
there. Spencer, do was easy. Go look at
the It's probably like one of the most
the It's probably like one of the most
ridiculous neural nets I've ever seen.
ridiculous neural nets I've ever seen.
So, like, yeah, go look up the Open AI5
So, like, yeah, go look up the Open AI5
architecture real quick. Let's dance
architecture real quick. Let's dance
something.
something.
Well, I thought we went over this one
Well, I thought we went over this one
day and you were like, it's conceptually
day and you were like, it's conceptually
simple. It's encoders are like not the
simple. It's encoders are like not the
end of the world. Just like it's not the
end of the world. Just like it's not the
end of the world in the sense that like
end of the world in the sense that like
it's like like you can see very easily
it's like like you can see very easily
how you would put them together for any
how you would put them together for any
given problem based on the data
given problem based on the data
types. But it still makes a huge mess of
types. But it still makes a huge mess of
the network and it's very hard to make
the network and it's very hard to make
that run fast.
Well, was Dota fast or did they just
Well, was Dota fast or did they just
drop like
drop like
ungodly amounts of compute on top of it?
ungodly amounts of compute on top of it?
They dropped a thousand GPUs on it,
They dropped a thousand GPUs on it,
right? Oh, also let's see how what we
right? Oh, also let's see how what we
need to do to beat the Dota
need to do to beat the Dota
record. That's the thing we can do now.
record. That's the thing we can do now.
What? In terms of like steps versus like
What? In terms of like steps versus like
total steps per hour or
whatever. So, two million frames every
whatever. So, two million frames every
two seconds.
two seconds.
Oh, that's like a million frames per
Oh, that's like a million frames per
second, right? Hang on.
Oh, well, I mean, we just know we're
Oh, well, I mean, we just know we're
faster than that because we we process
faster than that because we we process
more than two a million F uh SPS. So,
more than two a million F uh SPS. So,
they just they did 1 million SPS for two
they just they did 1 million SPS for two
months with a rerun. As long as your
months with a rerun. As long as your
frame equals your Yeah. So, literally
frame equals your Yeah. So, literally
like two month. That's like literally
like two month. That's like literally
all we have to do is we run on one box
all we have to do is we run on one box
like neural MMO 3. We run on one box for
like neural MMO 3. We run on one box for
a week and we take that record.
a week and we take that record.
Yeah. For a week or two months?
Yeah. For a week or two months?
uh one multiGPU box for like two weeks
uh one multiGPU box for like two weeks
a week or two. Yo, what's
up? How's it going? What's good? What's
up? How's it going? What's good? What's
Gucci? And what's up,
Linky? Is Is Dota still as popular as it
Linky? Is Is Dota still as popular as it
was? I think people still play Dota. is
was? I think people still play Dota. is
definitely nowhere near as popular as it
definitely nowhere near as popular as it
was, but I think there's still like a
was, but I think there's still like a
loyal community like versus League. How
loyal community like versus League. How
is it doing? League's way more popular
is it doing? League's way more popular
in terms of popularity. Oh, by the way,
in terms of popularity. Oh, by the way,
I actually Yo, uh Spencer, I thought of
I actually Yo, uh Spencer, I thought of
something that we could do if we wanted
something that we could do if we wanted
to try go back and uh see if we can get
to try go back and uh see if we can get
Riot interested.
Riot interested.
Something that would be way easier than
Something that would be way easier than
like full MOA is we could make like a
like full MOA is we could make like a
really good laning sim.
really good laning sim.
There you go. Just laning in terms of uh
There you go. Just laning in terms of uh
like what like the actual hero laning or
like what like the actual hero laning or
the champ laning or creep laning. Creep
the champ laning or creep laning. Creep
laning. Creep laning versus like uh RL
laning. Creep laning versus like uh RL
like enemy. So it's like a micro
like enemy. So it's like a micro
practice thing and just get like really
practice thing and just get like really
yes an enemy.
So you could why not just solve that
So you could why not just solve that
with a just a
with a just a
hard-coded last hitter bot
hard-coded last hitter bot
because it's really freaking hard to do
because it's really freaking hard to do
that.
that.
Is it really? Yes. Incredibly.
Is it really? Yes. Incredibly.
That's not an easy problem. You start
That's not an easy problem. You start
you start to get you start to get a
you start to get you start to get a
bunch of lower health. Yeah. That's No,
bunch of lower health. Yeah. That's No,
you're also the enemy is freaking
you're also the enemy is freaking
hitting you. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you're
hitting you. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you're
managing your health as well. You're
managing your health as well. You're
trading like health for last hits and
trading like health for last hits and
stuff.

Yeah. Yeah. What brand is your

you saying I'm cooked? I'll I'll answer
you saying I'm cooked? I'll I'll answer

And Spencer, not not impressed. Okay.
And Spencer, not not impressed. Okay.
The ability item and modifier encoders
The ability item and modifier encoders
are not that big a deal. It's it's they
are not that big a deal. It's it's they
concat some stats. Throw full fully
concat some stats. Throw full fully

freeing fully connected.
freeing fully connected.
So the unit stats I don't think are that
So the unit stats I don't think are that
big a deal. But then they do what
big a deal. But then they do what
appears to be another

multi-headed attention kind of a vibe.
multi-headed attention kind of a vibe.
It it kind of feels like attention.
Yeah. And that unit attention keys thing
Yeah. And that unit attention keys thing
is a pain as well. I've did that with
is a pain as well. I've did that with
neural MMO
neural MMO
before. that I have no idea what that
before. that I have no idea what that
is, but yeah, I had to do that in my

PhD. It was jank.

Does it actually do anything? Yes. Yes,
Does it actually do anything? Yes. Yes,
it does.
it does.
Doesn't work. So, I understand like what
Doesn't work. So, I understand like what
max pooling does, but how does
max pooling does, but how does
like processing something through like a
like processing something through like a
fully connected to max pooling and then
fully connected to max pooling and then
I guess drop a relu or something after
I guess drop a relu or something after
that uh cause it to like give attention
that uh cause it to like give attention
vibes? Like is it just you like
vibes? Like is it just you like
essentially the max and then no no no
essentially the max and then no no no
it's totally different with images
it's totally different with images
versus with what we use it for in RL
versus with what we use it for in RL
man. So like it's max over entities like
man. So like it's max over entities like
think that you have like 10 units that
think that you have like 10 units that
you can look at instead of feeding them
you can look at instead of feeding them
into a big flat layer where like you
into a big flat layer where like you
don't know what order which one is in
don't know what order which one is in
and like you have to learn for all
and like you have to learn for all
possible orders. You just you pass each
possible orders. You just you pass each
one through the same layer independently
one through the same layer independently
and then you max over the result. So
and then you max over the result. So
it's basically you get like an embedding
it's basically you get like an embedding
for each entity independently and then
for each entity independently and then
you take a max element wise. So that
you take a max element wise. So that
actually gives you like that operation
actually gives you like that operation
is mathematically identical no matter
is mathematically identical no matter
what order you put them in. That's the
what order you put them in. That's the
key.
Okay. I'm speaking from like deep diving
Okay. I'm speaking from like deep diving

It's easy to read, but could I have come
It's easy to read, but could I have come
up with this? Probably not. It's This
up with this? Probably not. It's This
thing's super dense. Yeah, this is

This team was amazing as well.
I am not seeing any coms though.

we're going to see how that goes
we're going to see how that goes

Terraform.
Terraform.
Yeah. What do you think about So I
Yeah. What do you think about So I
switched it back to fixed resetting and
switched it back to fixed resetting and
I mean it expands fairly well to you

know go from wherever it stopped and you

just turn off you know the resets and
just turn off you know the resets and
let it eval for a

Is that something that we should handle

ultimately if you have a metric that is

closer and closer to that you'll see it
closer and closer to that you'll see it
do more of the

just message the guy and be like, "Yo, I
just message the guy and be like, "Yo, I
like this thing. Like, can we talk about

your stuff?" And most of the time people
your stuff?" And most of the time people
be like, "Yeah,
cool." All right, I think I'm going to
cool." All right, I think I'm going to
head out. I'll let you know how sweeps
head out. I'll let you know how sweeps
go tomorrow morning. All right, I'm
go tomorrow morning. All right, I'm
going to bed soon. I'm just making sure
going to bed soon. I'm just making sure
things are reasonable. And I'm going to

Okay, this seems worse. This 44 one.
This is the sketch thing. Is it like
This is the sketch thing. Is it like

gotten a little bit above 7, but not
much. I hope there wasn't some like jank
much. I hope there wasn't some like jank
end change.
Is it up?

I got any messages to Answer.
All
right, that's all my stuff handled.
right, that's all my stuff handled.
Um, I'm going to call it and get some

We have some folks on Twitch. So, yeah,
We have some folks on Twitch. So, yeah,
for the folks watching dev
for the folks watching dev
Thanks for dropping by. Got a ton of
Thanks for dropping by. Got a ton of
experiments
experiments
running. I'm hoping that tomorrow we'll
running. I'm hoping that tomorrow we'll
just have the sweep stuff fixed, the DTP
just have the sweep stuff fixed, the DTP
stuff fixed, and we'll be able to like
stuff fixed, and we'll be able to like
cue all our experiment up. We'll fix
cue all our experiment up. We'll fix
some stuff on meta. We'll fix a few
some stuff on meta. We'll fix a few
other things. We'll do terraform stuff,
other things. We'll do terraform stuff,
all that. And uh yeah, we should
all that. And uh yeah, we should
actually be able to ship this thing
actually be able to ship this thing
quite soon.
quite soon.
the experiments always drag on. So
the experiments always drag on. So
like it's fine. I've already started on
like it's fine. I've already started on
like new stuff with Terraform and
like new stuff with Terraform and
whatnot like post 300. Anyways, if any
whatnot like post 300. Anyways, if any
of you are developing environments, get
of you are developing environments, get
them PR so that they get into 3. And uh

time is dev behind 30 yeah go 30 is just
time is dev behind 30 yeah go 30 is just
like I made the release branch because
like I made the release branch because
otherwise I have to change all the links
otherwise I have to change all the links
in the new docs so yeah that's it's just

use 3
use 3
um 3 is going to be the branch that just

Hey

Not a great policy at

That's funny.
All right. What do we got for uh
All right. What do we got for uh

This is just like the laggiest

he stopped replying.
But the crazy thing about it is he was

This is a

It would be really nice if this thing

Nope. Their stuff is just
down. Well, I mean this was the fix
down. Well, I mean this was the fix
though.
I guess then what we do is in the

Yeah, we like try to hunt our sweeps
Yeah, we like try to hunt our sweeps

Maybe I can try that again.
See where my tab

Yeah, that's a good
Yeah, that's a good

I guess the next thing is going to be I
I guess the next thing is going to be I
mean when we actually run a sweep trying

to get a sweep to run with DDP
to get a sweep to run with DDP
maybe so that
maybe so that
um we can actually sweep taking into

That would be interesting to

I'm looking for like other things in

I did bet it didn't it didn't repro

No, I'm just trying to like get a sense

Mhm. I should probably run a better like
Mhm. I should probably run a better like
attempt at repro on the

again? Okay, Neptune's back

up. So, I can actually probably go look
up. So, I can actually probably go look
for the original now.
Auto.
Auto. Uh,
really? Oh, I guess
really? Oh, I guess
so. Huh?
Well, this is a breakout
one. So, this is
auto. Okay. So, I mean according to
auto. Okay. So, I mean according to
this, this
this, this
is what was run.
Oh, we actually can probably have these
Oh, we actually can probably have these
uh getting darker. It gets dark, you'll
uh getting darker. It gets dark, you'll
actually be able to see the tiny boxes
actually be able to see the tiny boxes
in the background. They're really cool.
There's the grid sweep.
I guess the question is going to be if
I guess the question is going to be if
this doesn't repro, what the hell
this doesn't repro, what the hell
happened, right?
This is the one from last night.
Oh, that's why it was down. They were
Oh, that's why it was down. They were
updating the website.
I'm trying to think what else I can do
I'm trying to think what else I can do
in the meantime cuz
in the meantime cuz
like I need to run this experiment for a
while. Start a new M stuff.

I mean these are kind of the two crucial

DDP like DDP and good sweeps are the two

putting off like just the work of uh
putting off like just the work of uh
figuring out and exporting all the new

that. I think realistically how much
that. I think realistically how much

It's kind of just like

DDP. We have pretty much all the

done. I guess we just have to put all

put all the new M's
put all the new M's

up. I guess I could technically go do
some detective work on
um on what's happening
here. It's just so weird that this is

single card speed is comparable to any

basically. Like if this repros the
basically. Like if this repros the
sweep, then I'll be able to solve this
sweep, then I'll be able to solve this
issue. If this doesn't repro

though, then what the hell do I do?
What's the contingency plan for if this
What's the contingency plan for if this
doesn't reap
Yeah, but like the sweep repro [ __ ]
Yeah, but like the sweep repro [ __ ]
takes
takes

have a very nice log of

So it's like controlling the number of

eval before eval is important.
But I'm trying to think what like what

is even the error surface, right?

Like if this doesn't repro, what what is

even the possible error surface?
I'm pretty sure this is the same machine
I'm pretty sure this is the same machine
I ran the

If I go to this sweep
our grids made.
They are

before the bet deck ref bug fix.
Which is probably why I have a bunch of
Which is probably why I have a bunch of

Why is this on float

That's fine.

Hold
Hold

five. Oh, no. I just see five.

Okay, the five at 60 bill
Okay, the five at 60 bill
is pretty decent.
Just some meta stuff.
See how this

Huh. Interesting.
Oh, come on. Is this going to actually
All

very similar
very similar
results. Although I think this is

slower if I uh recall. Yeah, this is a
slower if I uh recall. Yeah, this is a
fair bit slower.
It's actually a really big concern if
It's actually a really big concern if
the sweep does still doesn't repro.
Like that would be really major,
Like that would be really major,
wouldn't
wouldn't
it? We need those sweeps. That's like
it? We need those sweeps. That's like
one of the main things for the uh
one of the main things for the uh
results uh of the release.
The only thing I could possibly think
The only thing I could possibly think
of, right, is that I changed some
of, right, is that I changed some
defaults or some like sweep params.
Yeah, but like there's a difference
Yeah, but like there's a difference
between there being a little bit of
between there being a little bit of
variability and like the thing perfectly
variability and like the thing perfectly
solving in less than 100 experiments
solving in less than 100 experiments

We also have results for multiple ends.
We also have results for multiple ends.
There's a difference for at least for

Best thing I can do is just to let this
Best thing I can do is just to let this
thing
run. Yeah, I mean I
can here. We'll do that right here.
You can clearly see it trends
differently. Okay,
differently. Okay,
ready? We'll put these guys
ready? We'll put these guys
here the chat

that

that did not work.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
So you can see qualitatively right the

massive difference in these two
massive difference in these two
runs. If I go to our sample view or our

here. Okay. So first of all I mean I
guess this 200 run is like split like
guess this 200 run is like split like
two different runs in here. So whatever
two different runs in here. So whatever
we'll do like this.
Now you can see the

Oh, that's
something. I'm just like messing around

with a few
things pretty much.
I figured I would like mix the um the
I figured I would like mix the um the
main hypers from grid with the gamma
main hypers from grid with the gamma

lambda tuned for meta and see if that
does anything.
I don't think anything could have

I was pretty sure
I was pretty sure
that I mean I guess I can go double

explain the lack of

reproing though. Admittedly, I'm not

sure that it doesn't repro yet, right?
Like these are pretty good. It could be
Like these are pretty good. It could be
I just straight up didn't run this for
I just straight up didn't run this for
long enough, you
know, that this just is a slow start and
know, that this just is a slow start and
then it actually works.
then it actually works.
I could believe
that. I mean, it would be it would make
that. I mean, it would be it would make
the most sense to be honest out of
the most sense to be honest out of
anything cuz it would be like absolutely
anything cuz it would be like absolutely
crazy cursed if this doesn't
crazy cursed if this doesn't
repro. I mean, and then if this does
repro. I mean, and then if this does
repro, I should just be able to go and
repro, I should just be able to go and
exactly match all of the hyper pram
exactly match all of the hyper pram
ranges and like be less cavalier about
ranges and like be less cavalier about
it and then that should just run.
That would actually be the best
outcome. I should actually probably

assume that that's the case or at least
assume that that's the case or at least
plan for that possibly being the case.
plan for that possibly being the case.
So once I finish this one meta
So once I finish this one meta
experiment, I should set it up to like
experiment, I should set it up to like
run that sweep confirmation and just be
run that sweep confirmation and just be
very careful about matching
very careful about matching
params. Then that's kind of
it. I might just do that for
it. I might just do that for
tonight. Then I'll have pretty much
tonight. Then I'll have pretty much
everything up and running.
Uh, I'm currently rerunning the old
Uh, I'm currently rerunning the old
sweep and then I'll have to set the new
sweep and then I'll have to set the new
one up locally, I think.
I Right.
Funny that nothing beats these params.
Yeah, this heart get is like way
better. Yeah. I know we will be able to
better. Yeah. I know we will be able to
beat these as well because
beat these as well because
like I suspect this doesn't correspond
like I suspect this doesn't correspond
to a ridiculously good policy.
It's hard to do objectively best
It's hard to do objectively best
params. Not really a way to do
params. Not really a way to do
that. There's no theory behind any of
that. There's no theory behind any of
this
crap. Like really?
Yeah. I don't
know. You know what I really want to
know. You know what I really want to
work on once we get all the RL stuff
work on once we get all the RL stuff
working? I want to work on RL for
working? I want to work on RL for
sci-fi. Like, how do we use really good
sci-fi. Like, how do we use really good
RL to just make some sci-fi
tech? That's what I want to do.
Like if you were to pick fields, right?
Like if you were to pick fields, right?
Not fields that like you think are super
Not fields that like you think are super
important right now or whatever, but

like if you were to pick like what

Like I actually don't think humanoid

Is it is it possible to make an

[ __ ] Is that
[ __ ] Is that
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
possible? Hey, now we we actually have
possible? Hey, now we we actually have
the physics PhD here. We have a doctor
the physics PhD here. We have a doctor
of physics here, so we can ask him
of physics here, so we can ask him
stupid sci-fi
questions. Perfect.
Oh, a
Oh, a
physicist.
Like, so so in like the culture novels,
Like, so so in like the culture novels,
right? They've got like antimatter
right? They've got like antimatter
fueled engines for missiles and and

spaceships and [ __ ] Can we just do
that? Make it happen. It's not that
that? Make it happen. It's not that
hard, right?
hard, right?
Totally possible.
Yeah. So, like here's kind of one of the
Yeah. So, like here's kind of one of the
things that
um one of the things that kind of amuses

me and why I'm like I think that you
me and why I'm like I think that you
know probably like 80% of these like

what if this sci-fi like they're
what if this sci-fi like they're
probably stupid but like you got to
probably stupid but like you got to
think about it there's probably zero

people actually
trying ideas are pretty
good. Yeah, that author was crazy as
good. Yeah, that author was crazy as
well. He was like a nutty, but he could
well. He was like a nutty, but he could
write some cool
stuff, you know, like one of the things

I
I
actually I really appreciated about his
actually I really appreciated about his

self-aware. Yo uh bet did you read use

ridiculously ridiculously leftist idea

of a like a a fantasy like sci-fi
of a like a a fantasy like sci-fi

yeah so do I. that that scene from the

just also really self-aware in a kind of

antimatter is like you blow up a
antimatter is like you blow up a

Yeah. So like a gram of it is is 10 the

Like there's no way, right? So
Like there's no way, right? So
like it kind of
like it kind of
is it's like you've almost got nothing

actually let's let's do another like
actually let's let's do another like

more thing.
10 the

I honestly didn't expect this to work
I honestly didn't expect this to work

like is there like
actually like like just based on your

why this is batshit and like not even

We just don't have room temperature
We just don't have room temperature

Wait, you Tyler also like the main thing
Wait, you Tyler also like the main thing
is the superconductors, they only work
is the superconductors, they only work
when it's really cold, right? And like
when it's really cold, right? And like
it's freaking absolute zero in

Ah, that's freaking
Ah, that's freaking
cool. They become

So,
it's you have to confine it with
it's you have to confine it with
magnetic
fields. Do you basically you
fields. Do you basically you
need is the idea just that you need
need is the idea just that you need
ridiculously strong magnets and the only
ridiculously strong magnets and the only
way to make ridiculously strong magnets
way to make ridiculously strong magnets
is with really good superconductors.
Is that the
idea? Yes. If you don't want your coils
melting, what if the coils were in
melting, what if the coils were in
freaking
freaking
space, right? Does that
help? Base is really cold.
Cosmic microwave

cool.
Okay. So, your your calcs basically
match match mine,

6. Yeah, that's about
it at a jewel
it at a jewel
range
is Yeah. Like my like dead reckoning
is Yeah. Like my like dead reckoning
based on like no actual knowledge guess
based on like no actual knowledge guess
is like if you accidentally blew up a

rocket it would level like some city
rocket it would level like some city
blocks and if you accidentally well if
blocks and if you accidentally well if
you blew up a nuke you know it leaves
you blew up a nuke you know it leaves
like a mile wide crater or
whatever. Where does then Saturn V? This
whatever. Where does then Saturn V? This

um this is the SpaceX
um this is the SpaceX
one is the the reference for biggest

it a crater is a crater, right?
Isn't that a like irrelevant bet? Cuz
Isn't that a like irrelevant bet? Cuz
like Yeah, like any explosion does that.
like Yeah, like any explosion does that.
The bigger explosion does it more,
right? Or am I dumb?
I mean, that's just saying it's a shock
I mean, that's just saying it's a shock
wave, right? But like, that's literally
wave, right? But like, that's literally
any any
explosive. So, like that's not that's
explosive. So, like that's not that's
not like a meaningful distinction then.
not like a meaningful distinction then.
Yeah.
It's not like, oh, it does more because
It's not like, oh, it does more because
the type. It's cuz it releases more
the type. It's cuz it releases more
energy,
right? Obviously, like ignoring the
right? Obviously, like ignoring the
radiation damage.
Yeah, but like I wasn't even considering
Yeah, but like I wasn't even considering
it for that, right? Like then the point
it for that, right? Like then the point
was not for weaponry. The point was like
was not for weaponry. The point was like
amount of
energy. Like the amount of energy in a
energy. Like the amount of energy in a
nuke is enough to get you into orbit.
Literally, it's actually probably a lot
Literally, it's actually probably a lot
more energy than you need to get you
more energy than you need to get you
into orbit considering it weighs a lot
into orbit considering it weighs a lot
less than a ship,
right? It probably weighs way less than
right? It probably weighs way less than
the rocket as well.
So that's probably enough to get like
So that's probably enough to get like
several of the like actual rocket
several of the like actual rocket

I think that they nowadays they do
I think that they nowadays they do
actually have them that are really
actually have them that are really

he actually knows physics. Do you think
he actually knows physics. Do you think
PyTorch treats ops like com 2D and
PyTorch treats ops like com 2D and
basharm 2D and so on as single nodes or

they break them into elementary
they break them into elementary

ops?
Um, it depends on the operation. So like
Um, it depends on the operation. So like
some some operations have fused kernels
some some operations have fused kernels
and some don't.
and some don't.
I would expect that com is pretty
I would expect that com is pretty

right. Will
do. I don't know. One of the things I
do. I don't know. One of the things I
would like to like get a sense of from
would like to like get a sense of from

physically
physically
impossible. What is like probably
impossible. What is like probably
possible? We just don't know how to do
possible? We just don't know how to do

for power electronics. That is the holy
grail. But like how good like what does
grail. But like how good like what does
it let you do, right?
Like I can tell you like the holy grail
Like I can tell you like the holy grail
for reinforcement learning, right? Like
for reinforcement learning, right? Like
what does it imply if we solve
what does it imply if we solve
reinforcement learning? It means that
reinforcement learning? It means that
you have a synthetic intelligence that
you have a synthetic intelligence that
is able to learn like like a human would
is able to learn like like a human would
or better um just from any form of

So in a sense solving RL would mean
So in a sense solving RL would mean
solving intelligence itself.
Reinforcement is just one way to learn
Reinforcement is just one way to learn
the solving of RL right the implication
the solving of RL right the implication
right the hypothesis is that it is a

RL there has to be an interaction part
RL there has to be an interaction part
to it Ahmed otherwise it's just

supervised learning
We don't try to shoehorn RL into
We don't try to shoehorn RL into
everything. There has to be some
everything. There has to be some
interactive process. I think we have to
interactive process. I think we have to
solve intelligence first to get sci-fi
solve intelligence first to get sci-fi
applications. Yeah. And that's like the
applications. Yeah. And that's like the
deep mind theory of stuff, right? Which
deep mind theory of stuff, right? Which
is why I work on this as well because
is why I work on this as well because
there are probably some problems that
there are probably some problems that
are AI
are AI
complete. But I don't see language

the problem I care most about is the
the problem I care most about is the

everything else.
But that one's also probably AI

I don't think there will ever be any

aging. Why
not? I mean, that seems ridiculous.
the biological process. Of course, you
the biological process. Of course, you
can screw with it. We just don't know
can screw with it. We just don't know
how to

already immortal strains of cells,
right? It actually to me it seems like

it seems impossible that we can't solve
it seems impossible that we can't solve
it.
I'm
I'm

depressing,
depressing,
right? I mean, that's like such a

know. I'm pretty optimistic about tech
and what tech can do for us.
Um, I honestly think like one of the
Um, I honestly think like one of the
crazier beliefs I have is that I think
crazier beliefs I have is that I think
we're literally going to look back on
we're literally going to look back on

going to be the difference.
No, I'm not really religious. This

resampling. Spencer, I apologize. What

were you saying? You're good.
were you saying? You're good.
Uh I think the problem was that it from

the beginning it wasn't getting that
the beginning it wasn't getting that
diverse of a sample based on the
diverse of a sample based on the
random being called too quickly and I
random being called too quickly and I
think they were basically running the
think they were basically running the
same randoms within a few milliseconds

and since the seeding of randoms based
and since the seeding of randoms based
off of time null which is based in
off of time null which is based in
seconds it wasn't getting that like that

diverse of a a level. So even when you
diverse of a a level. So even when you
tried to resample the same hundred which
tried to resample the same hundred which
I thought was statistically like diverse
I thought was statistically like diverse
enough I think it actually wasn't and
enough I think it actually wasn't and
and that's why it was like failing. So
and that's why it was like failing. So
when I changed the the random seating to
when I changed the the random seating to
like
like
the like another way of getting time but
the like another way of getting time but
I think you can get it in terms of like
I think you can get it in terms of like
microsconds or at least in a smaller
microsconds or at least in a smaller
thing where you'd see a difference
thing where you'd see a difference
between one process to another when
between one process to another when
spawning them. Yeah. Um,
it was no longer hard capped at like 86%
it was no longer hard capped at like 86%
on Perf, you know, I've actually looked
on Perf, you know, I've actually looked
at trying to fix that before, but it's
at trying to fix that before, but it's
kind of obnoxious to get the time in
kind of obnoxious to get the time in
microsconds, right?
microsconds, right?
Yeah. So, I didn't do it. So, good call.
Yeah. So, I didn't do it. So, good call.
I don't know if it's going to will fully
I don't know if it's going to will fully
solve it, right?
solve it, right?
But I have a new sweep going. It's going
But I have a new sweep going. It's going
to take like a day, right? Cuz it's like
to take like a day, right? Cuz it's like
slow. Um, you know, we might want to
slow. Um, you know, we might want to
just integrate that into endbinding
just integrate that into endbinding
where like we pass a seed in and we make
where like we pass a seed in and we make
puffer like default give you like time
puffer like default give you like time
ns or something.
Yeah, there there's something you could
Yeah, there there's something you could
do there.
do there.
Oh, I another seating thing. Seating was
Oh, I another seating thing. Seating was
also breaking DDP.
also breaking DDP.
Oh, really? Yeah. Seating all the
Oh, really? Yeah. Seating all the
because it was seating all the workers
because it was seating all the workers
the same. breaking DDP. Yeah. The reason
the same. breaking DDP. Yeah. The reason
why I found that was a problem for
why I found that was a problem for
seeding was because when I was doing
seeding was because when I was doing
terraform experiments, the pllin what
terraform experiments, the pllin what
was it? The I was trying to give it a
was it? The I was trying to give it a
random seed with pear and noise and
random seed with pear and noise and
weird somewhere in the sweep it was
weird somewhere in the sweep it was
spawning levels that started at 25%
spawning levels that started at 25%
completion
which meant that there was some
which meant that there was some
percentage of the grouping of levels
percentage of the grouping of levels
that were identical.
that were identical.
Yeah, that makes sense.
Yeah, that makes sense.
And so I applied that solution and then
And so I applied that solution and then
I'm running that. I did a bunch of small
I'm running that. I did a bunch of small
things to um
things to um
Terraform. I added an observation
Terraform. I added an observation
because we didn't have an observation to
because we didn't have an observation to
see its own
see its own
load. And I added a legal action small
load. And I added a legal action small
penalty. I changed a little bit of how
um the delta observation map, you know,
um the delta observation map, you know,
like the second channel of the the conve
like the second channel of the the conve
is
is
done.
done.
And and then I added a instead of doing
And and then I added a instead of doing
teleportitis via random, I made it if
teleportitis via random, I made it if
teleportitis if you're if you're stuck
teleportitis if you're if you're stuck
for a certain period of time.
for a certain period of time.
But if they're all like if they're all
But if they're all like if they're all
like mosh pit in the corner, I that's
like mosh pit in the corner, I that's
the one concern there.
What do you mean? If they're all like
What do you mean? If they're all like
doing like donuts or whatever in like a
doing like donuts or whatever in like a
little like corner of the map, like
little like corner of the map, like
stuff can happen like that where it's
stuff can happen like that where it's
just like
just like
I like I do that in neural MMO because
I like I do that in neural MMO because
like agents can just group up.
like agents can just group up.
Teleportitis is a pretty good hack for
Teleportitis is a pretty good hack for
that.
Maybe I just need to play with the
Maybe I just need to play with the
uh the frequency of it then.
Yeah, but I mean if it works in real
Yeah, but I mean if it works in real
MMO, I guess it probably could work.
MMO, I guess it probably could work.
Well, the thing that's a little tricky
Well, the thing that's a little tricky
with it is um depending on how you treat
with it is um depending on how you treat
your episodes, it can like
your episodes, it can like
cap your score or whatever
cap your score or whatever
uh during train time. So like it's a
uh during train time. So like it's a
little tricky to
configure. Um let's see if there's
configure. Um let's see if there's
anything else that I was trying to get
anything else that I was trying to get
out. I mean hopefully these sweeps just
out. I mean hopefully these sweeps just
work. I'm run the current experiment I'm
work. I'm run the current experiment I'm
running on Terraform is instead of doing
running on Terraform is instead of doing
plland noise to pear and noise

um I'm doing pear and noise to random

out. Next. The dilation's going to mess
out. Next. The dilation's going to mess
with you. I turned off dilation to one
with you. I turned off dilation to one
because the scoop is one.
because the scoop is one.
Can try it. It's tough because they
Can try it. It's tough because they
can't see very far at all. Then
can't see very far at all. Then
yeah, I mean, they can't see very far,
yeah, I mean, they can't see very far,
but I mean I also constricted the map a
but I mean I also constricted the map a
little
little
bit. And then I changed the reward scale
bit. And then I changed the reward scale
to one because it's only picking up one
to one because it's only picking up one
dirt. But I mean, I'm sweeping reward
dirt. But I mean, I'm sweeping reward
skill, so we'll see what it finds. Yeah.
skill, so we'll see what it finds. Yeah.
And then I dropped dozer capacity
And then I dropped dozer capacity
because it was abusing rewards by just
because it was abusing rewards by just
picking up everything without ever
picking up everything without ever
putting anything down.
Uh I'd already dropped dozer capacity a
Uh I'd already dropped dozer capacity a

it was at 5,000 before, man. All right.
it was at 5,000 before, man. All right.
Well, I made it 10 because it only picks
Well, I made it 10 because it only picks
up one at a time. Yeah, that's real
up one at a time. Yeah, that's real
small,
small,
though. That's like act that's smaller

than the actual bucket is going to be.
Well, it's all relative,

Yeah. Have

Okay. Like a better maybe. So this is

this is the branch that Oh yeah, my bad.
this is the branch that Oh yeah, my bad.
So this is the branch in which um I ran
So this is the branch in which um I ran
the old good maze sweep. It got like
the old good maze sweep. It got like
98%.
98%.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
You know, actually, this might be
You know, actually, this might be
correct cuz I'm looking at this thing
correct cuz I'm looking at this thing
and this thing is running longer
and this thing is running longer

Maybe this is just like I wake up in the
Maybe this is just like I wake up in the
morning, this repros, and then the other
morning, this repros, and then the other
one is just like, okay, figure out what
one is just like, okay, figure out what
specific hyper prim like sweep settings

it was that was screwing you

No, it's default config stuff. Ah, once

I fix this, it'll fix everything.
Yeah, it's hard to say. I'm facing Yeah,
Yeah, it's hard to say. I'm facing Yeah,
I'm facing the same issue at the moment.
Hopefully it can be figured out the next

I'm working on it. I got actually

like not for like a while. No, I

a little fiddly.
So, I'm thinking I want to do so I got

to like things I got to do for release,
to like things I got to do for release,
right? like top priority is get sweeps

everything. Uh DDP is a required thing
everything. Uh DDP is a required thing
in this release as well cuz I promised a

client that it would be included. Um and
client that it would be included. Um and
also DDP is just good to have. So we'll
also DDP is just good to have. So we'll
have that in. Uh I got to like you know
have that in. Uh I got to like you know
get all the end baselines, get all the
get all the end baselines, get all the
demos for the site and then we can just
demos for the site and then we can just
ship the Rio pretty much set. Um it's
ship the Rio pretty much set. Um it's
been set. It's just been needing the
been set. It's just been needing the
final experiments like always drag. And
final experiments like always drag. And
then after that, I've got like a couple
then after that, I've got like a couple
things to do on meta, but otherwise
things to do on meta, but otherwise
like I think building some industry
like I think building some industry
sims. Like terraform is definitely one.

Um GPU drive stuff is another. I'm
Um GPU drive stuff is another. I'm
thinking we should do some sort of like
thinking we should do some sort of like
drone stuff just
drone stuff just
because it would be so freaking easy
because it would be so freaking easy
with like this warming capabilities we
with like this warming capabilities we
have. It would be so
easy. Yeah, I don't think there's any
easy. Yeah, I don't think there's any
issue with that. I don't Especially

after seeing target. I mean, ideally,
after seeing target. I mean, ideally,
I'm trying to get GPU drive into 3.0.
I'm trying to get GPU drive into 3.0.
Yeah,
Yeah,
I'm just like at war with resampling for
I'm just like at war with resampling for
like the past like two weeks. Well, I
like the past like two weeks. Well, I
think what we should do is we should
think what we should do is we should
take some of these things that you're
take some of these things that you're
discovering and like try to make them
discovering and like try to make them
harder to screw up. Like we should
harder to screw up. Like we should
probably get seating to be like if you
probably get seating to be like if you
just use the end of binding seating,
just use the end of binding seating,
you'll just never have that bug. Stuff
you'll just never have that bug. Stuff
like that.
It's a good idea.
Yeah, I need to think about some of like
Yeah, I need to think about some of like
the small things I I change here and
the small things I I change here and
there to make things work and see if
there to make things work and see if
those could be helpful in other
those could be helpful in other
environments
cuz there's only so many things that can
cuz there's only so many things that can
go wrong. I feel I feel like this point
go wrong. I feel I feel like this point
I have so much confidence in the RL that
I have so much confidence in the RL that
it's just like something else must be
it's just like something else must be
wrong. Well, it's just like I still
wrong. Well, it's just like I still
break [ __ ] every so often. like when the
break [ __ ] every so often. like when the
sweeps go wrong, that takes confidence
sweeps go wrong, that takes confidence
and stuff, right? Like there's still
and stuff, right? Like there's still
things that need to be tested and
things that need to be tested and
whatnot. It's overall pretty damn good.
whatnot. It's overall pretty damn good.
Yeah, I'd agree. I'd agree.
Yeah. So I think next experiments I mean
Yeah. So I think next experiments I mean
I I think also I want to do like a
I I think also I want to do like a
puffer drive postGPU drive on like a
puffer drive postGPU drive on like a
large scale map.
large scale map.
I think we still have that. Um I haven't
I think we still have that. Um I haven't
heard back from that guy because I know
heard back from that guy because I know
he's back from his trip in Europe but um
he's back from his trip in Europe but um
I think that's something that still
I think that's something that still
probably worth some attention. Yeah. And
probably worth some attention. Yeah. And
any of those could be goodiz things.
and then I'll let you know how my
and then I'll let you know how my
conversation goes with the factory
conversation goes with the factory
people tomorrow.
Yeah, could definitely other than that I
Yeah, could definitely other than that I
mean I think on Terraform I don't think
mean I think on Terraform I don't think
I have too many questions. I mean, right
I have too many questions. I mean, right
now it's just seeing if this random uh

That's what you think.

Well, if you do it would have to be like

a grid channel, dude, right?
Are they not like a grid already?

They're not technically going to add it

Yeah, that's how you do it. You would
Yeah, that's how you do it. You would
have to loop over all the dozer. Yeah.
have to loop over all the dozer. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, I I was trying to find any

think I'm stuck with that approach at

because everything else is more

And I don't think it's that bad. Like I
And I don't think it's that bad. Like I
said, as long as I don't put in a

like a pretty decent job of making it
like a pretty decent job of making it
fast, but it's not I feel like I'm more
fast, but it's not I feel like I'm more
just like it's not amazing, right? Well,
just like it's not amazing, right? Well,
actually, I think that you can make the
actually, I think that you can make the
logic for like updating it in the end
logic for like updating it in the end
code, you can do that millions, no
code, you can do that millions, no
problem. Um yeah I mean I think the only
problem. Um yeah I mean I think the only
reason it's not mega fast in GPU drive
reason it's not mega fast in GPU drive
is the whole observation like being size
is the whole observation like being size
like 4,000. Yes. So that like the thing
like 4,000. Yes. So that like the thing
is it does add bandwidth and also coms
is it does add bandwidth and also coms
are
are
like coms are just not that fast of an
like coms are just not that fast of an
architecture. It turns out they're not.
architecture. It turns out they're not.
Yeah.
Like
Like
honestly, if whenever we can get away
honestly, if whenever we can get away
with it, doing like linear into LSTM or
with it, doing like linear into LSTM or
like MLP into LSTM gets us 2 million
like MLP into LSTM gets us 2 million
step per second training with uh like 2
step per second training with uh like 2
mil
mil
permps, right?
permps, right?
Which is
Which is
like no, we could end up literally doing
like no, we could end up literally doing
10 mil step per second training with a
10 mil step per second training with a
512 hidden
512 hidden
dim on a on a box. Pretty big.
That's only
That's only
like I think Dota like the Dota model is
like I think Dota like the Dota model is
a 4096 hidden dim. Yeah, it was. But do
a 4096 hidden dim. Yeah, it was. But do
they not have any coms?
they not have any coms?
Oh, they have a whole bunch of fancy
Oh, they have a whole bunch of fancy
like sub subnet encoders though. Yeah, I
like sub subnet encoders though. Yeah, I
think they might have had a couple like
think they might have had a couple like
map obs. I forget.
map obs. I forget.
But even then, I mean, their encoders
But even then, I mean, their encoders
weren't that crazy. Their encoders were
weren't that crazy. Their encoders were
incredibly crazy.
incredibly crazy.
This has just been like totally simple,
This has just been like totally simple,
right? Their
right? Their
encod tossed in like regular features in
encod tossed in like regular features in
there. Spencer, do was easy. Go look at
there. Spencer, do was easy. Go look at
the It's probably like one of the most
the It's probably like one of the most
ridiculous neural nets I've ever seen.
ridiculous neural nets I've ever seen.
So, like, yeah, go look up the Open AI5
So, like, yeah, go look up the Open AI5
architecture real quick. Let's dance
architecture real quick. Let's dance
something.
something.
Well, I thought we went over this one
Well, I thought we went over this one
day and you were like, it's conceptually
day and you were like, it's conceptually
simple. It's encoders are like not the
simple. It's encoders are like not the
end of the world. Just like it's not the
end of the world. Just like it's not the
end of the world in the sense that like
end of the world in the sense that like
it's like like you can see very easily
it's like like you can see very easily
how you would put them together for any
how you would put them together for any
given problem based on the data
given problem based on the data
types. But it still makes a huge mess of
types. But it still makes a huge mess of
the network and it's very hard to make
the network and it's very hard to make
that run fast.
Well, was Dota fast or did they just
Well, was Dota fast or did they just
drop like
drop like
ungodly amounts of compute on top of it?
ungodly amounts of compute on top of it?
They dropped a thousand GPUs on it,
They dropped a thousand GPUs on it,
right? Oh, also let's see how what we
right? Oh, also let's see how what we
need to do to beat the Dota
need to do to beat the Dota
record. That's the thing we can do now.
record. That's the thing we can do now.
What? In terms of like steps versus like
What? In terms of like steps versus like
total steps per hour or
whatever. So, two million frames every
whatever. So, two million frames every
two seconds.
two seconds.
Oh, that's like a million frames per
Oh, that's like a million frames per
second, right? Hang on.
Oh, well, I mean, we just know we're
Oh, well, I mean, we just know we're
faster than that because we we process
faster than that because we we process
more than two a million F uh SPS. So,
more than two a million F uh SPS. So,
they just they did 1 million SPS for two
they just they did 1 million SPS for two
months with a rerun. As long as your
months with a rerun. As long as your
frame equals your Yeah. So, literally
frame equals your Yeah. So, literally
like two month. That's like literally
like two month. That's like literally
all we have to do is we run on one box
all we have to do is we run on one box
like neural MMO 3. We run on one box for
like neural MMO 3. We run on one box for
a week and we take that record.
a week and we take that record.
Yeah. For a week or two months?
Yeah. For a week or two months?
uh one multiGPU box for like two weeks
uh one multiGPU box for like two weeks
a week or two. Yo, what's
up? How's it going? What's good? What's
up? How's it going? What's good? What's
Gucci? And what's up,
Linky? Is Is Dota still as popular as it
Linky? Is Is Dota still as popular as it
was? I think people still play Dota. is
was? I think people still play Dota. is
definitely nowhere near as popular as it
definitely nowhere near as popular as it
was, but I think there's still like a
was, but I think there's still like a
loyal community like versus League. How
loyal community like versus League. How
is it doing? League's way more popular
is it doing? League's way more popular
in terms of popularity. Oh, by the way,
in terms of popularity. Oh, by the way,
I actually Yo, uh Spencer, I thought of
I actually Yo, uh Spencer, I thought of
something that we could do if we wanted
something that we could do if we wanted
to try go back and uh see if we can get
to try go back and uh see if we can get
Riot interested.
Riot interested.
Something that would be way easier than
Something that would be way easier than
like full MOA is we could make like a
like full MOA is we could make like a
really good laning sim.
really good laning sim.
There you go. Just laning in terms of uh
There you go. Just laning in terms of uh
like what like the actual hero laning or
like what like the actual hero laning or
the champ laning or creep laning. Creep
the champ laning or creep laning. Creep
laning. Creep laning versus like uh RL
laning. Creep laning versus like uh RL
like enemy. So it's like a micro
like enemy. So it's like a micro
practice thing and just get like really
practice thing and just get like really
yes an enemy.
So you could why not just solve that
So you could why not just solve that
with a just a
with a just a
hard-coded last hitter bot
hard-coded last hitter bot
because it's really freaking hard to do
because it's really freaking hard to do
that.
that.
Is it really? Yes. Incredibly.
Is it really? Yes. Incredibly.
That's not an easy problem. You start
That's not an easy problem. You start
you start to get you start to get a
you start to get you start to get a
bunch of lower health. Yeah. That's No,
bunch of lower health. Yeah. That's No,
you're also the enemy is freaking
you're also the enemy is freaking
hitting you. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you're
hitting you. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you're
managing your health as well. You're
managing your health as well. You're
trading like health for last hits and
trading like health for last hits and
stuff.

Yeah. Yeah. What brand is your

you saying I'm cooked? I'll I'll answer
you saying I'm cooked? I'll I'll answer

And Spencer, not not impressed. Okay.
And Spencer, not not impressed. Okay.
The ability item and modifier encoders
The ability item and modifier encoders
are not that big a deal. It's it's they
are not that big a deal. It's it's they
concat some stats. Throw full fully

freeing fully connected.
freeing fully connected.
So the unit stats I don't think are that
So the unit stats I don't think are that
big a deal. But then they do what
big a deal. But then they do what
appears to be another

multi-headed attention kind of a vibe.
multi-headed attention kind of a vibe.
It it kind of feels like attention.
Yeah. And that unit attention keys thing
Yeah. And that unit attention keys thing
is a pain as well. I've did that with
is a pain as well. I've did that with
neural MMO
neural MMO
before. that I have no idea what that
before. that I have no idea what that
is, but yeah, I had to do that in my

PhD. It was jank.

Does it actually do anything? Yes. Yes,
Does it actually do anything? Yes. Yes,
it does.
it does.
Doesn't work. So, I understand like what
Doesn't work. So, I understand like what
max pooling does, but how does
max pooling does, but how does
like processing something through like a
like processing something through like a
fully connected to max pooling and then
fully connected to max pooling and then
I guess drop a relu or something after
I guess drop a relu or something after
that uh cause it to like give attention
that uh cause it to like give attention
vibes? Like is it just you like
vibes? Like is it just you like
essentially the max and then no no no
essentially the max and then no no no
it's totally different with images
it's totally different with images
versus with what we use it for in RL
versus with what we use it for in RL
man. So like it's max over entities like
man. So like it's max over entities like
think that you have like 10 units that
think that you have like 10 units that
you can look at instead of feeding them
you can look at instead of feeding them
into a big flat layer where like you
into a big flat layer where like you
don't know what order which one is in
don't know what order which one is in
and like you have to learn for all
and like you have to learn for all
possible orders. You just you pass each
possible orders. You just you pass each
one through the same layer independently
one through the same layer independently
and then you max over the result. So
and then you max over the result. So
it's basically you get like an embedding
it's basically you get like an embedding
for each entity independently and then
for each entity independently and then
you take a max element wise. So that
you take a max element wise. So that
actually gives you like that operation
actually gives you like that operation
is mathematically identical no matter
is mathematically identical no matter
what order you put them in. That's the
what order you put them in. That's the
key.
Okay. I'm speaking from like deep diving
Okay. I'm speaking from like deep diving

It's easy to read, but could I have come
It's easy to read, but could I have come
up with this? Probably not. It's This
up with this? Probably not. It's This
thing's super dense. Yeah, this is

This team was amazing as well.
I am not seeing any coms though.

we're going to see how that goes
we're going to see how that goes

Terraform.
Yeah. What do you think about So I
Yeah. What do you think about So I
switched it back to fixed resetting and
switched it back to fixed resetting and
I mean it expands fairly well to you

just turn off you know the resets and

let it eval for a

Is that something that we should handle

ultimately if you have a metric that is

closer and closer to that you'll see it
closer and closer to that you'll see it
do more of the
do more of the

just message the guy and be like, "Yo, I
just message the guy and be like, "Yo, I

your stuff?" And most of the time people
your stuff?" And most of the time people
be like, "Yeah,
cool." All right, I think I'm going to
cool." All right, I think I'm going to
head out. I'll let you know how sweeps
head out. I'll let you know how sweeps
go tomorrow morning. All right, I'm
go tomorrow morning. All right, I'm
going to bed soon. I'm just making sure
going to bed soon. I'm just making sure

Okay, this seems worse. This 44 one.
This is the sketch thing. Is it like
This is the sketch thing. Is it like

gotten a little bit above 7, but not
much. I hope there wasn't some like jank
much. I hope there wasn't some like jank
end change.
Is it up?

I got any messages to Answer.
All
right, that's all my stuff handled.
right, that's all my stuff handled.
Um, I'm going to call it and get some

We have some folks on Twitch. So, yeah,
We have some folks on Twitch. So, yeah,
for the folks watching dev
for the folks watching dev
Thanks for dropping by. Got a ton of
Thanks for dropping by. Got a ton of
experiments
experiments
running. I'm hoping that tomorrow we'll
running. I'm hoping that tomorrow we'll
just have the sweep stuff fixed, the DTP
just have the sweep stuff fixed, the DTP
stuff fixed, and we'll be able to like
stuff fixed, and we'll be able to like
cue all our experiment up. We'll fix
cue all our experiment up. We'll fix
some stuff on meta. We'll fix a few
some stuff on meta. We'll fix a few
other things. We'll do terraform stuff,
other things. We'll do terraform stuff,
all that. And uh yeah, we should
all that. And uh yeah, we should
actually be able to ship this thing
actually be able to ship this thing
quite soon.
quite soon.
the experiments always drag on. So
the experiments always drag on. So
like it's fine. I've already started on
like it's fine. I've already started on
like new stuff with Terraform and
like new stuff with Terraform and
whatnot like post 300. Anyways, if any
whatnot like post 300. Anyways, if any
of you are developing environments, get
of you are developing environments, get
them PR so that they get into 3. And uh

time is dev behind 30 yeah go 30 is just
time is dev behind 30 yeah go 30 is just
like I made the release branch because
like I made the release branch because
otherwise I have to change all the links
otherwise I have to change all the links
in the new docs so yeah that's it's just

use 3
use 3
um 3 is going to be the branch that just
