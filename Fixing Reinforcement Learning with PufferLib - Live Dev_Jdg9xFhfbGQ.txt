we are back
live I'm going to
live I'm going to
do probably a quick morning session on
do probably a quick morning session on
this hyperr
this hyperr
stuff and then uh we will see I think
stuff and then uh we will see I think
there's going to be robotics to do
there's going to be robotics to do
today what on Earth is this
I know this is yeah this will be quite
I know this is yeah this will be quite
different
all
right so we got this from yesterday
let's see um I think I
let's see um I think I
swept some additional hyper
swept some additional hyper
parameters let me
see okay that's actually that's about on
see okay that's actually that's about on
par with
par with
um with all of our previous stuff
we do get slightly
we do get slightly
better coverage of the number of
better coverage of the number of
environments it looks
like these are probably just
like these are probably just
resamples yeah we get better coverage
resamples yeah we get better coverage
here a little
bit and
then okay this one as
well and
Lambda these are definitely different
Lambda these are definitely different
from before but they
from before but they
are these are not anywhere near as
are these are not anywhere near as
tightly
tightly
spread same with
spread same with
learning
learning
rate these are most likely
resamples time
resamples time
steps ah and then this cost
steps ah and then this cost
here this is an issue because this is
here this is an issue because this is
not so there's still some work it looks
not so there's still some work it looks
like to do here
here's the Pito
front oh that's kind of
cool we actually have good perf over
cool we actually have good perf over
a a quite wide front of learning
a a quite wide front of learning
rate so this is legitimate that that
rate so this is legitimate that that
it's uh it's sampling all of
it's uh it's sampling all of
these it looks like the resample is
these it looks like the resample is
buggy
buggy
here entropy is it's also stable
over a wide amount of entropy it looks
over a wide amount of entropy it looks
like
Lambda Gamma as
well
well
interesting these don't get
swept ah we actually do have
swept ah we actually do have
now good runs over the entire up to
now good runs over the entire up to
Depot
Depot
front Okay so this is qualitatively very
front Okay so this is qualitatively very
different from
different from
before possibly because some of these
before possibly because some of these
are in the higher cost
regions but that's pretty cool that we
regions but that's pretty cool that we
have this much more
stable
stable
region now if we do cost less than 60
region now if we do cost less than 60
say
it's
what the [ __ ] is wrong with this stupid
what the [ __ ] is wrong with this stupid
query
system there we
go oh it's a assist running time
command
enter well this is [ __ ] that it's
enter well this is [ __ ] that it's
not doing this
um
um
hello less than one
hello less than one
minute it just gave me greater than a
minute there we go
okay so now we
okay so now we
have we've got the main trunk of the
have we've got the main trunk of the
Paro front
here it still actually has much more
here it still actually has much more
stable parameters that it's
stable parameters that it's
found even update EPO at
one okay that's pretty
good this is finding parameters that are
good this is finding parameters that are
way more in line with what I would
expect oh hold on look at this
do we have a Min that's way too
high Min is 2
E7 it looks like at 1 E7 we have a good
E7 it looks like at 1 E7 we have a good
parameters
parameters
already oops
27 couple on stable runs mostly
good now we get a bunch of other
good now we get a bunch of other
preps got total time steps on
here 30 mil
so I mean this is not the result that I
expected but it is a good
expected but it is a good
result 38 at 20 right
here oh I see what we need to do
here oh I see what we need to do
do we have total time steps on here we
do we have total time steps on here we
don't I missed a
widget e
as you can see here
as you can see here
right that a huge number of runs are
right that a huge number of runs are
collapsed all the way back down to
collapsed all the way back down to
here and that uh it looks like we've got
here and that uh it looks like we've got
some of the highest perance here as well
it appears to be reasonable because um
doesn't look like you get very much
benefit from going uh higher 20.2 two
benefit from going uh higher 20.2 two
well this point is
well this point is
Paro there are a couple additional
Paro there are a couple additional
parito points but not really not a
ton now the question here I think all of
ton now the question here I think all of
these
runs are mostly reasonable but then one
it's done a lot of
runs and to be fair actually these
runs and to be fair actually these
points some of these points are pretty
points some of these points are pretty
good
good
over here
why does a point like this exist
right
15156 I'm guessing this was just an
unstable no it is stable it just didn't
unstable no it is stable it just didn't
learn
huh yeah there's nothing wrong with this
huh yeah there's nothing wrong with this
it's just learning
it's just learning
slow policy lost a little bit but not
slow policy lost a little bit but not
really is this like some tiny learning
really is this like some tiny learning
rate
only 48
M no that's very weird
I'm kind of surprised that this one is
I'm kind of surprised that this one is
bad oh these Max Brad norms and VF
bad oh these Max Brad norms and VF
things aren't great
h
these look like these would be pretty
these look like these would be pretty
good pramps they just learn too
good pramps they just learn too
slow interesting
enough okay I am curious to know if um
enough okay I am curious to know if um
if one of the good sets of params

seconds pretty low learning
rate
and let's see
much lower learning rate actually than
before uh tiny mini batch

Epoch so 16
Epoch so 16
updates it's not totally
crazy and then

96 97 okay I mean that's not too far out
96 97 okay I mean that's not too far out
of what is
reasonable it's fairly different from
reasonable it's fairly different from
what we got
before this didn't even go perfectly it
before this didn't even go perfectly it
had a little dip
I think we just uh I think we just
I think we just uh I think we just
rerun The
Sweep there were two changes one is the
Sweep there were two changes one is the
total time steps
total time steps
right e
oh yeah and then we wanted to
oh yeah and then we wanted to
do the clean RL prams
yeah these ones
and we'll see from
and we'll see from
there no Cuda GPU is available
there no Cuda GPU is available
really

well I'm going to go rerun this sweep
well I'm going to go rerun this sweep
and get a get breakfast just a short
