the idea is we're building a card game
the idea is we're building a card game
sim and I have an awkward amount of time
sim and I have an awkward amount of time
so I'm kind of just going to try to
so I'm kind of just going to try to
figure out what's going on here I've
figure out what's going on here I've
never played magic I've watched some
never played magic I've watched some
content about
it y y Commander I don't know what this
it y y Commander I don't know what this
is by default this is whatever default
is by default this is whatever default
arena
is do
is do
these okay
okay you tapped lands on yeah okay I
okay you tapped lands on yeah okay I
play a
play a
land and I can summon a second one right
land and I can summon a second one right
shorten for tutorial yeah one of them
shorten for tutorial yeah one of them
can
can
attack this can attack
right and
right and
then what what is the UI with
this I'm hoping the animations go faster
this I'm hoping the animations go faster
than this
there are no
details uh three Mana I can play this
right all go
right all go
face oh wait no
face oh wait no
I forget yes okay this is one of the
I forget yes okay this is one of the
games in which you are you can choose
games in which you are you can choose
your block cool yes Hearthstone is the
your block cool yes Hearthstone is the
one where you cannot choose
block can I like make all these
block can I like make all these
animations to go
animations to go
fast well obviously I don't need the
fast well obviously I don't need the
animations in the
animations in the
end there's no this minion
end there's no this minion
attacks one of them is declare all
attacks one of them is declare all
attacks okay
attacks okay
why is this
uh will it destroy it'll destroy one of
uh will it destroy it'll destroy one of
them won't
it can I not just attack anyways okay
it can I not just attack anyways okay
don't
don't
attack yeah I figured I could just go
attack yeah I figured I could just go
face and it would block it would hit
face and it would block it would hit
two I don't
know okay
whatever do you take damage
through okay he takes two even a small
through okay he takes two even a small
clature backs blocks all damage okay
clature backs blocks all damage okay
cool
destroy a Target tapped
creature unless the opposing teacher has
creature unless the opposing teacher has
trample no extra Okay cool so I these
trample no extra Okay cool so I these
are just all variations on things I know
cool tap All Creatures your opponent
cool tap All Creatures your opponent
control controlls
cool tap creatures cannot okay so now
cool tap creatures cannot okay so now
they're tap so I can go face and win
they're tap so I can go face and win
yeah that's the tutorial
cool and it gives me a card cool untap
cool and it gives me a card cool untap
it start a turn yep is there a freaking
it start a turn yep is there a freaking
option
option
for are there options to disable a bunch
for are there options to disable a bunch
of like to make stuff go
faster looks like there
aren't also let me just make sure I have
aren't also let me just make sure I have
my email up on the side here because I
my email up on the side here because I
told somebody that uh I forgot to

yada make an RL agent why do you think
yada make an RL agent why do you think
I'm streaming this at the moment because
I'm streaming this at the moment because
we are doing
we are doing
that or at least we're considering it
that or at least we're considering it
I've got some more meetings later
today I'll consider making a little bit
today I'll consider making a little bit
of it open in the Discord actually I'd
of it open in the Discord actually I'd
be happy to chat with some people on
be happy to chat with some people on
Discord uh later in the evening about
Discord uh later in the evening about
ideas for this
stuff this blocks this this blocks
this did you know magic is Turing
this did you know magic is Turing
complete completely irrelevant so is so
complete completely irrelevant so is so
is the instruction
is the instruction
move the move instruction is also turn
move the move instruction is also turn
complete doesn't
matter so uh are you supposed to just
matter so uh are you supposed to just
lose to this as part of the tutorial is
lose to this as part of the tutorial is
this just like hey aggro decks are hard
this just like hey aggro decks are hard
or like what what is this I guess it's
like
like
okay you heal
[Music]
[Music]
and these things
die
yeah uh this thing can
yeah uh this thing can
block how would you make an
block how would you make an
environment I feel that would be
environment I feel that would be
incredibly time-taking
incredibly time-taking
well that's what I'm why that's what I'm
well that's what I'm why that's what I'm
doing at the moment is I'm trying to
doing at the moment is I'm trying to
figure out how hard like all these
figure out how hard like all these
mechanics would be to
implement and seven and
implement and seven and
three uh so he'll
block I think either way he just dies
block I think either way he just dies
here right
yeah I don't know I think having like a
yeah I don't know I think having like a
basic the thing that's going to be uh
basic the thing that's going to be uh
this doesn't do anything uh having a a
this doesn't do anything uh having a a
basic card game like a basic card engine
basic card game like a basic card engine
type thing is not going to take very
type thing is not going to take very
long at all um it's just like all the
long at all um it's just like all the
effects and stuff and Magic that are
effects and stuff and Magic that are
going to be I have to get a sense of how
going to be I have to get a sense of how
hard it will be for various effects
hard it will be for various effects
I mean a lot of cards have like similar
I mean a lot of cards have like similar
effects so I think that we can get a
effects so I think that we can get a
decent group of them pretty quickly but
decent group of them pretty quickly but
like I I know that there things like
like I I know that there things like
triggers and stuff keywords are easy but
triggers and stuff keywords are easy but
things like triggers are hard unlocked
things like triggers are hard unlocked
cards cool
do you have 15 life or is this just a
do you have 15 life or is this just a
tutorial I thought you had like 20 or 40

cool can't be blocked yeah
cool can't be blocked yeah
whatever do
whatever do
this uh one two put
this uh one two put
this cool
this cool
you get 20 okay so it's just a
tutorial enchant creature
cool resolve faster
please okay it's just a tutorial being
please okay it's just a tutorial being
stupidly slow come
on this is like the single digit number
on this is like the single digit number
of brain cell tutorial
uh
uh
three so I can't play this I can play
three so I can't play this I can play
this 2

and that's a and I've watched a bunch of
and that's a and I've watched a bunch of
card game content that's it for context
card game content that's it for context
here which is why I'm currently doing
here which is why I'm currently doing
this because it one of the dumbest
this because it one of the dumbest
things you can do in RL is to try to
things you can do in RL is to try to
like do anything without understanding
like do anything without understanding
the
environments like literally that's the
environments like literally that's the
most important
most important
thing completely Justified research
thing completely Justified research
stream I'm probably just going to play
stream I'm probably just going to play
the tutorial right now is all I'm going
the tutorial right now is all I'm going
to do and then I'll have a
meeting
um you gain can this heal you over
um you gain can this heal you over
Max
Max
three oh well I don't have land hold on
three oh well I don't have land hold on
this auto play cool just do
this auto play cool just do
this all
this all
attack

Aura uh okay can I not do this do I not
have land for this
have land for this
oops no I do cockatrice which should be
oops no I do cockatrice which should be
a
a
Sandbox oh I'll check it out for uh the
Sandbox oh I'll check it out for uh the
structure but like we're going to build
structure but like we're going to build
something that runs a million steps a
something that runs a million steps a
second if we're going to do
second if we're going to do
anything oh Ultra ultra high perf is the
anything oh Ultra ultra high perf is the
name of the
game like I think I could knock out a
game like I think I could knock out a
basic card game sim in like a thousand
basic card game sim in like a thousand
lines of C in a weekend um obviously
lines of C in a weekend um obviously
like the full thing is a lot more
but I need to get a better sense of the
but I need to get a better sense of the
mechanics to know what type of stuff
mechanics to know what type of stuff
will be hard
surprising I don't have any emails
here yada
yada enchant and has
yada enchant and has
flying uh what's he have he has a 4
flying uh what's he have he has a 4
six and he has a 2 two do I do
six and he has a 2 two do I do
this I think that's
better yeah now you can't kill anything
better yeah now you can't kill anything
with the
block and I have to deal six this turn
block and I have to deal six this turn
to not lose right
yeah yeah can these can we skip all the
yeah yeah can these can we skip all the
voice lines
voice lines
please
please
um
um
O Okay so wait
O Okay so wait
six so I need to do this and then
six so I need to do this and then
enchant this so that he can't survive
enchant this so that he can't survive
with blocks right
with blocks right
yeah and then I just win cool
all
all
right that was not
right that was not
hard uh
hard uh
continue
play the hardest thing so far is waiting
play the hardest thing so far is waiting
for animations to
for animations to
finish I mean as well like to implement
finish I mean as well like to implement
I don't think a couple of these effects
I don't think a couple of these effects
so far would be a little tricky we
so far would be a little tricky we
haven't gotten anything that triggers
haven't gotten anything that triggers
yet
though is there not like a mute voice
though is there not like a mute voice
lines
lines
thing
no or skip
this is probably going to be the uh the
this is probably going to be the uh the
tutorial for like they have spells or
tutorial for like they have spells or
whatever right yeah so they have a
whatever right yeah so they have a
reaction yeah they have an instant
okay me make sure I'm not missing
emails looks like I'm not
emails looks like I'm not
well I guess I messed up I I forgot to I
well I guess I messed up I I forgot to I
was supposed to have a coffee chat but I
was supposed to have a coffee chat but I
forgot to uh to
forgot to uh to
confirm so I guess he just assumed I
confirm so I guess he just assumed I
wasn't
available my
available my
bad uh
bad uh
yeah do you have more of
yeah do you have more of
these no you just have a flash
these no you just have a flash
creature
creature
okay I don't understand what this
okay I don't understand what this
supposed to
do
cool okay instance no longer
work sacrifice a creature draw two cards
work sacrifice a creature draw two cards
cool
but then it goes face if you do that
but then it goes face if you do that
right oh wait how did that just work
right oh wait how did that just work
wait so it blocked but then it's got
wait so it blocked but then it's got
sacrificed so I don't get the hit that's
weird deals one damage for each swamp
weird deals one damage for each swamp
Okay
um when it
enters lock
enters lock
first oh this is an in okay this is the
first oh this is an in okay this is the
instance tutorial
right okay yeah I get it it's just I
right okay yeah I get it it's just I
don't get the order these things are
don't get the order these things are
resolved in but I see what's happening
resolved in but I see what's happening
okay
cool so I have to understand the order
cool so I have to understand the order
of the stack or whatever Target block
of the stack or whatever Target block
creature next I'll
Attack okay this kills one
right how does this wait you can block
right how does this wait you can block
with two things is is this a
thing Target blocking or blocked
thing Target blocking or blocked
creature okay so we do this and now it
creature okay so we do this and now it
just defeat it just hits both of them
just defeat it just hits both of them
right
yeah confront the assault
yeah confront the assault
create three tokens with flying
create three tokens with flying
cool so I'm sure that there's going to
cool so I'm sure that there's going to
be some reaction
no yeah so you're going to make a bunch
no yeah so you're going to make a bunch
of these and then I have to play this to
of these and then I have to play this to
block sure right
Ed creature

okay I know this is an iconic uh this is
okay I know this is an iconic uh this is
like an iconic Commander or something
right
okay uh do you discard last
okay uh do you discard last
here do you assume that you draw more
lands okay
and now I have I can only play this
uh I don't want to attack with this
uh I don't want to attack with this
right
yeah okay so this is the pulling dragon
yeah okay so this is the pulling dragon
from graveyard right this is Graveyard
from graveyard right this is Graveyard
mechanic right
y and
y and
and three and two do I block with this
and three and two do I block with this
yeah I
yeah I
do so I do one blocker and then I do oh
do so I do one blocker and then I do oh
wait plus two plus two so I could
wait plus two plus two so I could
destroy the
dragon but then this dies or I can
dragon but then this dies or I can
destroy this and live which I don't know
destroy this and live which I don't know
is that better
yeah we'll try
this gain four life
this gain four life
um never
another enters you gain one life and
another enters you gain one life and
draw a
draw a
card three four I can't play this
card three four I can't play this
anyways I have to just play this
it's kind of funny like actually I'm
it's kind of funny like actually I'm
realizing that many of the times you
realizing that many of the times you
don't really have very many
don't really have very many
choices right based on what is
choices right based on what is
legal you actually have very few
choices so actually if you if you parse
choices so actually if you if you parse
the action space of this
the action space of this
correctly the branching Factor should be
correctly the branching Factor should be
quite small in many
quite small in many
cases two damage to flying
cases two damage to flying
okay big
spell draws seven
spell draws seven
cards what in the heck
okay that's kind of broken
huh that's funny destroy tap Target
creature okay big creature
if a creature is attacking to you you
if a creature is attacking to you you
can create some tokens
can create some tokens
cool yeah we don't do
this so these are both tapped but I
this so these are both tapped but I
don't have yeah I don't have the card
don't have yeah I don't have the card
for this
for this
cast wait cast a
cast wait cast a
spell oh wait wait these okay I just
spell oh wait wait these okay I just
misre yeah sure we do this and then this
misre yeah sure we do this and then this
blocks everything because you full Block
blocks everything because you full Block
in Magic
in Magic
right oh and then these activate on
right oh and then these activate on
tokens so you gain a ton of these
things uh but I don't have any more Mana
things uh but I don't have any more Mana
so I can only do
so I can only do
this if you wanted to do card and RL how
this if you wanted to do card and RL how
would you en code the
would you en code the
text rather you'd have to have a
text rather you'd have to have a
specific property yeah it would be
specific property yeah it would be
basically a set of properties like
basically a set of properties like
internally the game has like represent
internally the game has like represent
that has properties that represent a lot
that has properties that represent a lot
of this stuff I'm sure um so you
of this stuff I'm sure um so you
wouldn't encode the text you would
wouldn't encode the text you would
encode properties into a struct of some
encode properties into a struct of some
type the network architecture is going
type the network architecture is going
to be a little bit
to be a little bit
hairy wait what I Target blocked
hairy wait what I Target blocked
creature gains plus two plus two that
creature gains plus two plus two that
doesn't do anything even if if I use
doesn't do anything even if if I use
that it doesn't kill anything so we just
that it doesn't kill anything so we just
do
do
this but yeah that's what I was looking
this but yeah that's what I was looking
at
essentially uh
essentially uh
ples
ples
cat and this is for
blocked Target blocking or blocked
blocked Target blocking or blocked
creature does this mean
creature does this mean
can I use this when I
attack well this doesn't do anything if
attack well this doesn't do anything if
I attack here
right wait are we going to RL magic that
right wait are we going to RL magic that
would be dope what what do you think I'm
would be dope what what do you think I'm
doing here I'm trying to figure out
doing here I'm trying to figure out
figure that
out purely based on syntax
out purely based on syntax
that'd be interesting I mean Hearthstone
that'd be interesting I mean Hearthstone
is very keywords Z so that would
is very keywords Z so that would
probably be easier but uh
probably be easier but uh
yeah yes you can
yeah yes you can
well I mean hey I you know what folks I
well I mean hey I you know what folks I
will host something in Discord later
will host something in Discord later
this evening in a few hours um it'll
this evening in a few hours um it'll
probably I have a bunch of other stuff
probably I have a bunch of other stuff
to do so it might be well I'm working
to do so it might be well I'm working
out or something we'll see but I will uh
out or something we'll see but I will uh
I will host something in the Discord and
I will host something in the Discord and
we can chat about it
we can chat about it
teacher the man well thank
teacher the man well thank
you I actually have a surprising number
you I actually have a surprising number
of people interested in this project as
of people interested in this project as
well so I have a meeting shortly about
well so I have a meeting shortly about
this uh I had one earlier today keep
this uh I had one earlier today keep
your angel
alive
alive
okay choose your
okay choose your
blockers targeting
blockers targeting
blocking plus two plus
blocking plus two plus
two so
wait I'm confused can I not just
wait I'm confused can I not just
do yeah this blocks this because it's
do yeah this blocks this because it's
going to be able to have this right and
going to be able to have this right and
then we just use a token on this two
then we just use a token on this two
blockers uh and then we use this here so
blockers uh and then we use this here so
then this actually kills this
right Hearthstone has words like battle
right Hearthstone has words like battle
Yeah they have they have
Yeah they have they have
um yeah keywords
Enchanted
Enchanted
creature gets plus three plus three okay
creature gets plus three plus three okay
so now I win right and now I uh all
attack which is
attack which is
fine does this do anything if I
fine does this do anything if I
five3 yes this does this is worth it
five3 yes this does this is worth it
because this kills this
[Music]
[Music]
okay uh five
67 do I wait no blocks I'm
67 do I wait no blocks I'm
confused I can do this yeah okay it's
confused I can do this yeah okay it's
just the UI so I can do this and this
dies
dies
um sure
and then all
and then all
attack and I win
attack and I win
cool and that's the tutorial
and they give you oh cool they actually
and they give you oh cool they actually
do give you some
do give you some
decks they give you a goblin deck as
decks they give you a goblin deck as
well
well
cool uh yeah the colors have archetypes
cool uh yeah the colors have archetypes
I know that yeah red is H Red's the
I know that yeah red is H Red's the
aggro deck
right cool
is it
is it
352 let me make
sure okay well I have a little time so
sure okay well I have a little time so
I'll go play like a game or whatever
I'll go play like a game or whatever
versus uh versus a
bot
okay
okay
okay would love to contribute pull up
okay would love to contribute pull up
we're going to do uh I said I'll host a
we're going to do uh I said I'll host a
chat in it's discord.gg SLP puffer later
chat in it's discord.gg SLP puffer later
today I'll host a thing just watch in
today I'll host a thing just watch in
there I'll just host something in voice
there I'll just host something in voice
um and we can chat like this all the
um and we can chat like this all the
stuff I do is open source right so like
stuff I do is open source right so like
yeah we we want people to help stuff cuz
yeah we we want people to help stuff cuz
I don't have time to do this whole thing
I don't have time to do this whole thing
like alone even if I wanted to um my
like alone even if I wanted to um my
thinking is probably I will at least get
thinking is probably I will at least get
the Prototype code uh written myself on
the Prototype code uh written myself on
stream or whatever and then I will need
stream or whatever and then I will need
people to actually pick it up from there
people to actually pick it up from there
choose
deck why can't I I can't play like mono
deck why can't I I can't play like mono
red
deck fully unlock oh okay
I guess you have to choose one of
these oh yeah yeah I forgot there's a
these oh yeah yeah I forgot there's a
mull again okay
mull again okay
cool uh
just join dis we'll look out yeah
just join dis we'll look out yeah
basically I've got uh after this I'm
basically I've got uh after this I'm
going to Ping uh my colleague to have an
going to Ping uh my colleague to have an
initial meet and then after that I'll
initial meet and then after that I'll
probably uh start something on the
probably uh start something on the
Discord
Discord
basically uh what are we
Mulligan Mulligan is whole new hand
Mulligan Mulligan is whole new hand
actually isn't it
I mean I have a land I have two lands in
I mean I have a land I have two lands in
a one drop right no I have a two this is
a one drop right no I have a two this is
a two
a two
drop is that
okay dinosaur burning Sun I don't think
okay dinosaur burning Sun I don't think
that this is
that this is
great
Mulligan pick your poison
Mulligan pick your poison
dude what the heck is
this well I have to keep five cuz
this well I have to keep five cuz
like not going to have keep lands and
like not going to have keep lands and
just hope we're
just hope we're
good drag two cards to the bottom of
good drag two cards to the bottom of
your library
okay uh we'll just do the
yeah I think I screwed up I should have
yeah I think I screwed up I should have
just not
just not
Mulligan
Mulligan
Mountain what do we have we want this
yeah Target creature
yeah Target creature
gains well no I don't want to do that
gains well no I don't want to do that
thank
thank
you pass
[Music]
land
land
drag put them on the top of your library
wait
wait
what put them on the top of your
library hey pubs we're thinking about
library hey pubs we're thinking about
doing an
doing an
mtgm but uh I don't understand what the
mtgm but uh I don't understand what the
[ __ ] let's
see I still can't play anything I think
see I still can't play anything I think
I just screwed Myself by mulliganing by
I just screwed Myself by mulliganing by
uh I I just screwed myself cuz I had a
uh I I just screwed myself cuz I had a
way better initial
way better initial
hand yeah I literally can't do anything
hand yeah I literally can't do anything
I don't have any
creatures uh yeah I just have to keep
creatures uh yeah I just have to keep
clicking resolve until I get smacked
here would be a lot of work to cold
here would be a lot of work to cold
every card property
every card property
yep I mean it'll be an incremental thing
yep I mean it'll be an incremental thing
right
okay I got to hurry this up
okay I got to hurry this up
though uh oh I can play
though uh oh I can play
this target
this target
dinosaur deals
dinosaur deals
damage equal to its
power gain

May reveal a dinosaur in your
May reveal a dinosaur in your
hand so can I do

this and then reveal
this and then reveal
this
this
submit and then you gain

turn this goes
here this
goes
here oh I can play multiple okay
cool and these can't do anything so no
cool and these can't do anything so no
attacks yada
yada make an RL agent why do you think
yada make an RL agent why do you think
I'm streaming this at the moment because
I'm streaming this at the moment because
we are doing
we are doing
that or at least we're considering it
that or at least we're considering it
I've got some more meetings later
today I'll consider making a little bit
today I'll consider making a little bit
of it open in the Discord actually I'd
of it open in the Discord actually I'd
be happy to chat with some people on
be happy to chat with some people on
Discord uh later in the evening about
Discord uh later in the evening about
ideas for this
stuff this blocks this this blocks
this did you know magic is Turing
this did you know magic is Turing
complete completely irrelevant so is so
complete completely irrelevant so is so
is the instruction
is the instruction
move the move instruction is also turn
move the move instruction is also turn
complete doesn't
matter so uh are you supposed to just
matter so uh are you supposed to just
lose to this as part of the tutorial is
lose to this as part of the tutorial is
this just like hey aggro decks are hard
this just like hey aggro decks are hard
or like what what is this I guess it's
like
like
okay you heal
[Music]
[Music]
and these things
die
yeah uh this thing can
yeah uh this thing can
block how would you make an
block how would you make an
environment I feel that would be
environment I feel that would be
incredibly time-taking
incredibly time-taking
well that's what I'm why that's what I'm
well that's what I'm why that's what I'm
doing at the moment is I'm trying to
doing at the moment is I'm trying to
figure out how hard like all these
figure out how hard like all these
mechanics would be to
implement and seven and
implement and seven and
three uh so he'll
block I think either way he just dies
block I think either way he just dies
here right
yeah I don't know I think having like a
yeah I don't know I think having like a
basic the thing that's going to be uh
basic the thing that's going to be uh
this doesn't do anything uh having a a
this doesn't do anything uh having a a
basic card game like a basic card engine
basic card game like a basic card engine
type thing is not going to take very
type thing is not going to take very
long at all um it's just like all the
long at all um it's just like all the
effects and stuff and Magic that are
effects and stuff and Magic that are
going to be I have to get a sense of how
going to be I have to get a sense of how
hard it will be for various effects
hard it will be for various effects
I mean a lot of cards have like similar
I mean a lot of cards have like similar
effects so I think that we can get a
effects so I think that we can get a
decent group of them pretty quickly but
decent group of them pretty quickly but
like I I know that there things like
like I I know that there things like
triggers and stuff keywords are easy but
triggers and stuff keywords are easy but
things like triggers are hard unlocked
things like triggers are hard unlocked
cards cool
do you have 15 life or is this just a
do you have 15 life or is this just a
tutorial I thought you had like 20 or 40
tutorial I thought you had like 20 or 40
or
something island flying
something island flying
cool can't be blocked yeah
cool can't be blocked yeah
whatever do
whatever do
this uh one two put
this uh one two put
this cool
this cool
you get 20 okay so it's just a
tutorial enchant creature
cool resolve faster
please okay it's just a tutorial being
please okay it's just a tutorial being
stupidly slow come
on this is like the single digit number
on this is like the single digit number
of brain cell tutorial
uh
uh
three so I can't play this I can play
three so I can't play this I can play
this 2
this 2
two better on this thing but probably I
two better on this thing but probably I
just do
this so I've played briefly I briefly
this so I've played briefly I briefly
played Legends of run
played Legends of run
Terra um
Terra um
and that's a and I've watched a bunch of
and that's a and I've watched a bunch of
card game content that's it for context
card game content that's it for context
here which is why I'm currently doing
here which is why I'm currently doing
this because it one of the dumbest
this because it one of the dumbest
things you can do in RL is to try to
things you can do in RL is to try to
like do anything without understanding
like do anything without understanding
the
environments like literally that's the
environments like literally that's the
most important
most important
thing completely Justified research
thing completely Justified research
stream I'm probably just going to play
stream I'm probably just going to play
the tutorial right now is all I'm going
the tutorial right now is all I'm going
to do and then I'll have a
meeting
um you gain can this heal you over
um you gain can this heal you over
Max
Max
three oh well I don't have land hold on
three oh well I don't have land hold on
this auto play cool just do
this auto play cool just do
this all
this all
attack
attack
this I think this works right he blocks
this I think this works right he blocks
this but I don't take damage right
Enchanted creature do not
untap
okay Enchanted creature gets plus two

Aura uh okay can I not do this do I not
Aura uh okay can I not do this do I not
have land for this
have land for this
oops no I do cockatrice which should be
oops no I do cockatrice which should be
a
a
Sandbox oh I'll check it out for uh the
Sandbox oh I'll check it out for uh the
structure but like we're going to build
structure but like we're going to build
something that runs a million steps a
something that runs a million steps a
second if we're going to do
second if we're going to do
anything oh Ultra ultra high perf is the
anything oh Ultra ultra high perf is the
name of the
game like I think I could knock out a
game like I think I could knock out a
basic card game sim in like a thousand
basic card game sim in like a thousand
lines of C in a weekend um obviously
lines of C in a weekend um obviously
like the full thing is a lot more
but I need to get a better sense of the
but I need to get a better sense of the
mechanics to know what type of stuff
mechanics to know what type of stuff
will be hard
surprising I don't have any emails
here yada
yada enchant and has
yada enchant and has
flying uh what's he have he has a 4
flying uh what's he have he has a 4
six and he has a 2 two do I do
six and he has a 2 two do I do
this I think that's
better yeah now you can't kill anything
better yeah now you can't kill anything
with the
block and I have to deal six this turn
block and I have to deal six this turn
to not lose right
yeah yeah can these can we skip all the
yeah yeah can these can we skip all the
voice lines
voice lines
please
please
um
um
O Okay so wait
O Okay so wait
six so I need to do this and then
six so I need to do this and then
enchant this so that he can't survive
enchant this so that he can't survive
with blocks right
with blocks right
yeah and then I just win cool
all
all
right that was not
right that was not
hard uh
hard uh
continue
play the hardest thing so far is waiting
play the hardest thing so far is waiting
for animations to
for animations to
finish I mean as well like to implement
finish I mean as well like to implement
I don't think a couple of these effects
I don't think a couple of these effects
so far would be a little tricky we
so far would be a little tricky we
haven't gotten anything that triggers
haven't gotten anything that triggers
yet
though is there not like a mute voice
though is there not like a mute voice
lines
lines
thing
no or skip
this is probably going to be the uh the
this is probably going to be the uh the
tutorial for like they have spells or
tutorial for like they have spells or
whatever right yeah so they have a
whatever right yeah so they have a
reaction yeah they have an instant
okay me make sure I'm not missing
emails looks like I'm not
emails looks like I'm not
well I guess I messed up I I forgot to I
well I guess I messed up I I forgot to I
was supposed to have a coffee chat but I
was supposed to have a coffee chat but I
forgot to uh to
forgot to uh to
confirm so I guess he just assumed I
confirm so I guess he just assumed I
wasn't
available my
available my
bad uh
bad uh
yeah do you have more of
yeah do you have more of
these no you just have a flash
these no you just have a flash
creature
creature
okay I don't understand what this
okay I don't understand what this
supposed to
do
cool okay instance no longer
work sacrifice a creature draw two cards
work sacrifice a creature draw two cards
cool
but then it goes face if you do that
but then it goes face if you do that
right oh wait how did that just work
right oh wait how did that just work
wait so it blocked but then it's got
wait so it blocked but then it's got
sacrificed so I don't get the hit that's
weird deals one damage for each swamp
weird deals one damage for each swamp
Okay
um when it
enters lock
enters lock
first oh this is an in okay this is the
first oh this is an in okay this is the
instance tutorial
right okay yeah I get it it's just I
right okay yeah I get it it's just I
don't get the order these things are
don't get the order these things are
resolved in but I see what's happening
resolved in but I see what's happening
okay
cool so I have to understand the order
cool so I have to understand the order
of the stack or whatever Target block
of the stack or whatever Target block
creature next I'll
Attack okay this kills one
right how does this wait you can block
right how does this wait you can block
with two things is is this a
thing Target blocking or blocked
thing Target blocking or blocked
creature okay so we do this and now it
creature okay so we do this and now it
just defeat it just hits both of them
just defeat it just hits both of them
right
yeah confront the assault
yeah confront the assault
create three tokens with flying
create three tokens with flying
cool so I'm sure that there's going to
cool so I'm sure that there's going to
be some reaction
no yeah so you're going to make a bunch
no yeah so you're going to make a bunch
of these and then I have to play this to
of these and then I have to play this to
block sure right
Ed creature
Ed creature

flying
cool and one more
cool and one more
tutorial was it 340
click click

okay I know this is an iconic uh this is
okay I know this is an iconic uh this is
like an iconic Commander or something
right
okay uh do you discard last
okay uh do you discard last
here do you assume that you draw more
lands okay
and now I have I can only play this
uh I don't want to attack with this
uh I don't want to attack with this
right
yeah okay so this is the pulling dragon
yeah okay so this is the pulling dragon
from graveyard right this is Graveyard
from graveyard right this is Graveyard
mechanic right
y and
y and
and three and two do I block with this
and three and two do I block with this
yeah I
yeah I
do so I do one blocker and then I do oh
do so I do one blocker and then I do oh
wait plus two plus two so I could
wait plus two plus two so I could
destroy the
dragon but then this dies or I can
dragon but then this dies or I can
destroy this and live which I don't know
destroy this and live which I don't know
is that better
yeah we'll try
this gain four life
this gain four life
um never
another enters you gain one life and
another enters you gain one life and
draw a
draw a
card three four I can't play this
card three four I can't play this
anyways I have to just play this
it's kind of funny like actually I'm
it's kind of funny like actually I'm
realizing that many of the times you
realizing that many of the times you
don't really have very many
don't really have very many
choices right based on what is
choices right based on what is
legal you actually have very few
choices so actually if you if you parse
choices so actually if you if you parse
the action space of this
the action space of this
correctly the branching Factor should be
correctly the branching Factor should be
quite small in many
quite small in many
cases two damage to flying
cases two damage to flying
okay big
spell draws seven
spell draws seven
cards what in the heck
okay that's kind of broken
huh that's funny destroy tap Target
creature okay big creature
if a creature is attacking to you you
if a creature is attacking to you you
can create some tokens
can create some tokens
cool yeah we don't do
this so these are both tapped but I
this so these are both tapped but I
don't have yeah I don't have the card
don't have yeah I don't have the card
for this
for this
cast wait cast a
cast wait cast a
spell oh wait wait these okay I just
spell oh wait wait these okay I just
misre yeah sure we do this and then this
misre yeah sure we do this and then this
blocks everything because you full Block
blocks everything because you full Block
in Magic
in Magic
right oh and then these activate on
right oh and then these activate on
tokens so you gain a ton of these
things uh but I don't have any more Mana
things uh but I don't have any more Mana
so I can only do
so I can only do
this if you wanted to do card and RL how
this if you wanted to do card and RL how
would you en code the
would you en code the
text rather you'd have to have a
text rather you'd have to have a
specific property yeah it would be
specific property yeah it would be
basically a set of properties like
basically a set of properties like
internally the game has like represent
internally the game has like represent
that has properties that represent a lot
that has properties that represent a lot
of this stuff I'm sure um so you
of this stuff I'm sure um so you
wouldn't encode the text you would
wouldn't encode the text you would
encode properties into a struct of some
encode properties into a struct of some
type the network architecture is going
type the network architecture is going
to be a little bit
to be a little bit
hairy wait what I Target blocked
hairy wait what I Target blocked
creature gains plus two plus two that
creature gains plus two plus two that
doesn't do anything even if if I use
doesn't do anything even if if I use
that it doesn't kill anything so we just
that it doesn't kill anything so we just
do
do
this but yeah that's what I was looking
this but yeah that's what I was looking
at
essentially uh
essentially uh
ples
ples
cat and this is for
blocked Target blocking or blocked
blocked Target blocking or blocked
creature does this mean
creature does this mean
can I use this when I
attack well this doesn't do anything if
attack well this doesn't do anything if
I attack here
right wait are we going to RL magic that
right wait are we going to RL magic that
would be dope what what do you think I'm
would be dope what what do you think I'm
doing here I'm trying to figure out
doing here I'm trying to figure out
figure that
out purely based on syntax
out purely based on syntax
that'd be interesting I mean Hearthstone
that'd be interesting I mean Hearthstone
is very keywords Z so that would
is very keywords Z so that would
probably be easier but uh
probably be easier but uh
yeah yes you can
yeah yes you can
well I mean hey I you know what folks I
well I mean hey I you know what folks I
will host something in Discord later
will host something in Discord later
this evening in a few hours um it'll
this evening in a few hours um it'll
probably I have a bunch of other stuff
probably I have a bunch of other stuff
to do so it might be well I'm working
to do so it might be well I'm working
out or something we'll see but I will uh
out or something we'll see but I will uh
I will host something in the Discord and
I will host something in the Discord and
we can chat about it
we can chat about it
teacher the man well thank
teacher the man well thank
you I actually have a surprising number
you I actually have a surprising number
of people interested in this project as
of people interested in this project as
well so I have a meeting shortly about
well so I have a meeting shortly about
this uh I had one earlier today keep
this uh I had one earlier today keep
your angel
alive
alive
okay choose your
okay choose your
blockers targeting
blockers targeting
blocking plus two plus
blocking plus two plus
two so
wait I'm confused can I not just
wait I'm confused can I not just
do yeah this blocks this because it's
do yeah this blocks this because it's
going to be able to have this right and
going to be able to have this right and
then we just use a token on this two
then we just use a token on this two
blockers uh and then we use this here so
blockers uh and then we use this here so
then this actually kills this
right Hearthstone has words like battle
right Hearthstone has words like battle
Yeah they have they have
Yeah they have they have
um yeah keywords
Enchanted
Enchanted
creature gets plus three plus three okay
creature gets plus three plus three okay
so now I win right and now I uh all
attack which is
attack which is
fine does this do anything if I
fine does this do anything if I
five3 yes this does this is worth it
five3 yes this does this is worth it
because this kills this
[Music]
[Music]
okay uh five
67 do I wait no blocks I'm
67 do I wait no blocks I'm
confused I can do this yeah okay it's
confused I can do this yeah okay it's
just the UI so I can do this and this
dies
dies
um sure
and then all
and then all
attack and I win
attack and I win
cool and that's the tutorial
and they give you oh cool they actually
and they give you oh cool they actually
do give you some
do give you some
decks they give you a goblin deck as
decks they give you a goblin deck as
well
well
cool uh yeah the colors have archetypes
cool uh yeah the colors have archetypes
I know that yeah red is H Red's the
I know that yeah red is H Red's the
aggro deck
right cool
is it
is it
352 let me make
sure okay well I have a little time so
sure okay well I have a little time so
I'll go play like a game or whatever
I'll go play like a game or whatever
versus uh versus a
bot
okay
okay
okay would love to contribute pull up
okay would love to contribute pull up
we're going to do uh I said I'll host a
we're going to do uh I said I'll host a
chat in it's discord.gg SLP puffer later
chat in it's discord.gg SLP puffer later
today I'll host a thing just watch in
today I'll host a thing just watch in
there I'll just host something in voice
there I'll just host something in voice
um and we can chat like this all the
um and we can chat like this all the
stuff I do is open source right so like
stuff I do is open source right so like
yeah we we want people to help stuff cuz
yeah we we want people to help stuff cuz
I don't have time to do this whole thing
I don't have time to do this whole thing
like alone even if I wanted to um my
like alone even if I wanted to um my
thinking is probably I will at least get
thinking is probably I will at least get
the Prototype code uh written myself on
the Prototype code uh written myself on
stream or whatever and then I will need
stream or whatever and then I will need
people to actually pick it up from there
people to actually pick it up from there
choose
deck why can't I I can't play like mono
deck why can't I I can't play like mono
red
deck fully unlock oh okay
I guess you have to choose one of
these oh yeah yeah I forgot there's a
these oh yeah yeah I forgot there's a
mull again okay
mull again okay
cool uh
just join dis we'll look out yeah
just join dis we'll look out yeah
basically I've got uh after this I'm
basically I've got uh after this I'm
going to Ping uh my colleague to have an
going to Ping uh my colleague to have an
initial meet and then after that I'll
initial meet and then after that I'll
probably uh start something on the
probably uh start something on the
Discord
Discord
basically uh what are we
Mulligan Mulligan is whole new hand
Mulligan Mulligan is whole new hand
actually isn't it
I mean I have a land I have two lands in
I mean I have a land I have two lands in
a one drop right no I have a two this is
a one drop right no I have a two this is
a two
a two
drop is that
okay dinosaur burning Sun I don't think
okay dinosaur burning Sun I don't think
that this is
that this is
great
Mulligan pick your poison
Mulligan pick your poison
dude what the heck is
this well I have to keep five cuz
this well I have to keep five cuz
like not going to have keep lands and
like not going to have keep lands and
just hope we're
just hope we're
good drag two cards to the bottom of
good drag two cards to the bottom of
your library
okay uh we'll just do the
yeah I think I screwed up I should have
yeah I think I screwed up I should have
just not
just not
Mulligan
Mulligan
Mountain what do we have we want this
yeah Target creature
yeah Target creature
gains well no I don't want to do that
gains well no I don't want to do that
thank
thank
you pass
[Music]
land
land
drag put them on the top of your library
wait
wait
what put them on the top of your
library hey pubs we're thinking about
library hey pubs we're thinking about
doing an
doing an
mtgm but uh I don't understand what the
mtgm but uh I don't understand what the
[ __ ] let's
see I still can't play anything I think
see I still can't play anything I think
I just screwed Myself by mulliganing by
I just screwed Myself by mulliganing by
uh I I just screwed myself cuz I had a
uh I I just screwed myself cuz I had a
way better initial
way better initial
hand yeah I literally can't do anything
hand yeah I literally can't do anything
I don't have any
creatures uh yeah I just have to keep
creatures uh yeah I just have to keep
clicking resolve until I get smacked
here would be a lot of work to cold
here would be a lot of work to cold
every card property
every card property
yep I mean it'll be an incremental thing
yep I mean it'll be an incremental thing
right
okay I got to hurry this up
okay I got to hurry this up
though uh oh I can play
though uh oh I can play
this target
this target
dinosaur deals
dinosaur deals
damage equal to its
power gain

May reveal a dinosaur in your
May reveal a dinosaur in your
hand so can I do
hand so can I do
this and then reveal
this and then reveal
this
this
submit and then you gain
life I think I'm just screwed here
life I think I'm just screwed here
though because I don't
though because I don't
have

yeah choose blockers uh well I'll block
yeah choose blockers uh well I'll block
with this for
with this for
sure and wait plus one plus
sure and wait plus one plus
three so I
three so I
can until R until end of
can until R until end of
turn plus one plus
turn plus one plus
three oh yeah so I can actually take out
three oh yeah so I can actually take out
his best card here right if I wait what
his best card here right if I wait what
why didn't I get to play this it's an
why didn't I get to play this it's an
instant I don't know understand what
instant I don't know understand what
happened why did I not did I not have
happened why did I not did I not have
Mana oh I didn't have Mana okay I'm
dumb plus 2 +
three five you need one green
three five you need one green

play Auto what's this
can I
do okay something I don't
understand wait am I stuck I'm
confused am I
confused am I
stuck oh deals damage equal to its power
stuck oh deals damage equal to its power
to another creature okay cool
and do I have this is already
and do I have this is already
tapped I should not have done all of
tapped I should not have done all of
that stuff so
yeah creature has an abbility deals
yeah creature has an abbility deals
damage yeah I read it
wrong and now I'm just screwed because
one

nope pay for
wait what the
wait what the
heck discover five what am I supposed to
do discover five I don't understand what
do discover five I don't understand what
I'm supposed to do pay
for oh I have to choose what Mana to pay
for oh I have to choose what Mana to pay
I
I
see uh that's fine
I but how do I I can't pay more I don't
I but how do I I can't pay more I don't
have that I'm
have that I'm
confused why did it let me do
this whatever this works
right uh so he has to block with two
right uh so he has to block with two
here but he can choose the order of
here but he can choose the order of
blocks so
first it's a creature for six Mana
first it's a creature for six Mana
second you can discard it yeah why did
second you can discard it yeah why did
it even let me do that because I don't
it even let me do that because I don't
have six
Mana I guess there's uh some missing
Mana I guess there's uh some missing
action masking
deals I don't understand why it lets me
deals I don't understand why it lets me
um it lets me like attempt to play this
um it lets me like attempt to play this
if I don't have manage for it
oh wait can you tap creatures is that a
oh wait can you tap creatures is that a
thing
thing
no I don't
understand drag to order the creatures
understand drag to order the creatures
blocking okay so I get to choose the
blocking okay so I get to choose the
order of the creatures
order of the creatures
blocking
cool UI is a bit wonky
cool UI is a bit wonky
yeah so we
yeah so we
destroy why oh I have a view Battlefield
destroy why oh I have a view Battlefield
so this is 8
so this is 8
N I have an 8 n so I these have to add
N I have an 8 n so I these have to add
to
to
nine so I
nine so I
destroy wait four five six seven8 n so
destroy wait four five six seven8 n so
he has actually nine worth of
he has actually nine worth of
stats I don't think it matters I think
stats I don't think it matters I think
they all annihilate regardless don't
they no was I
they no was I
wrong I don't
know uh
huh
reach yeah this is Jank cuz I can't even
reach yeah this is Jank cuz I can't even
tap it right like there's literally I
tap it right like there's literally I
don't
have I literally don't have the Mana I
have I literally don't have the Mana I
don't know what's up with the UI
don't know what's up with the UI
uh I literally can just do
this and I think I just
lose yeah I just
lose yeah I just
lose okay
cool let me double check if uh Aaron is
cool let me double check if uh Aaron is
around
I'll start uh another game we'll see
I'll start uh another game we'll see
when he's free he said a round
four uh I kind of hate this deck I'm not
four uh I kind of hate this deck I'm not
going to lie though I probably don't
going to lie though I probably don't
understand what the heck is happening
understand what the heck is happening
with it
you deal damage in order and have to
you deal damage in order and have to
