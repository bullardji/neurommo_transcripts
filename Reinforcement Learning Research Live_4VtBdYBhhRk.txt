we'll do that.
All right. Whatever.

Whatever. I don't want to deal with it.
It should be good. We'll just do it on
It should be good. We'll just do it on

Okay, so we need this random ring
Okay, so we need this random ring
function
I must have gotten rid of. Let me go
I must have gotten rid of. Let me go
grab it.
Oh yeah, star the puffer lip. Star the
Oh yeah, star the puffer lip. Star the
puffer if you haven't. It helps us out a
puffer if you haven't. It helps us out a
lot. It's free.
I say we just put this into the um
I say we just put this into the um
drone lab, right?
Oh, that actually already works. Cool.
So, yeah. So, that wasn't that hard,
So, yeah. So, that wasn't that hard,
right?
I don't know if it's actually using the
I don't know if it's actually using the
drone.
Yeah, it's probably not using the drone
Yeah, it's probably not using the drone
though. It's just using these like
though. It's just using these like
random functions.
random functions.
So, let's fix that.
Yeah. You see this has like position,
Yeah. You see this has like position,
previous position.
previous position.
So, what we're going to do is we'll just
So, what we're going to do is we'll just
do drone drone like this.
And drone does have position, right?
And drone does have position, right?
Let's just check.
So, this has position.
What's it need previous position for?
Oh, it does need previous position up.
Oh, it does need previous position up.
Okay, so we'll just do
three previous position.
Holy Yeah, there's going to have to be a
Holy Yeah, there's going to have to be a
lot of substitutions.
What's going to happen though
What's going to happen though
eventually, right? We're going to get to
eventually, right? We're going to get to
a point where these look similar enough
a point where these look similar enough
that we can just make it like either one
that we can just make it like either one
end with configs

or something.
or something.
We can kind of just train on a ton of
We can kind of just train on a ton of
different tasks. Like the RL is kind of
different tasks. Like the RL is kind of
good enough that if we just give it a
good enough that if we just give it a
lot of tasks for drones, as long as it's
lot of tasks for drones, as long as it's
fast and they're reasonably posed, it
fast and they're reasonably posed, it
should just work.
should just work.
The RL side's very good at this point.
The RL side's very good at this point.
It's mostly just about getting the Sims
It's mostly just about getting the Sims
uh to be built better and faster.
We're uh planning on improving the
We're uh planning on improving the

Awesome.
Awesome.
So, my plan, Sam, you can tell me if you
So, my plan, Sam, you can tell me if you
think that this makes sense here. So,
think that this makes sense here. So,
we're going to want to do a lot of
we're going to want to do a lot of
different stuff with these drones to
different stuff with these drones to
test them out. We're gonna have to do
test them out. We're gonna have to do
like the ring racing task. We'll do
like the ring racing task. We'll do
swarming stuff. We'll do like obstacle
swarming stuff. We'll do like obstacle
avoidance. We can do tons of stuff. I'm
avoidance. We can do tons of stuff. I'm
gonna try to I don't want to modularize
gonna try to I don't want to modularize
stuff a whole bunch to the point that it
stuff a whole bunch to the point that it
becomes heavy. All I want to do is just
becomes heavy. All I want to do is just
take like the drone physics and all the
take like the drone physics and all the
parts about the drone control and then
parts about the drone control and then
separate those from the task specifics.
separate those from the task specifics.
So, we can just have a couple hundred
So, we can just have a couple hundred
line like drone.h with all the physics
line like drone.h with all the physics
or whatever. And then we can just
or whatever. And then we can just
include that in whatever other Sims we
include that in whatever other Sims we
want to build around it, right? Whatever
want to build around it, right? Whatever
other task, whatever other Sims. And
other task, whatever other Sims. And
maybe eventually we will converge on
maybe eventually we will converge on
like one set of observations or, you
like one set of observations or, you
know, maybe we'll find other ways to
know, maybe we'll find other ways to
unify things. But I'm not going to worry
unify things. But I'm not going to worry
about that too much initially. I just
about that too much initially. I just
want to make sure that we have one spot
want to make sure that we have one spot
for at least like the physics and such.
for at least like the physics and such.
Um, and I think that'll help us out
Um, and I think that'll help us out
quite a bit because then I'm going to
quite a bit because then I'm going to
start like I'm going to start
start like I'm going to start
introducing randomized versions of
introducing randomized versions of
these, right? Or like I'm going to add
these, right? Or like I'm going to add
randomization parameters.
randomization parameters.
So you can just say all right uh
So you can just say all right uh
whenever the drone moves, right? Let's
whenever the drone moves, right? Let's
just screw with the physics by a small
just screw with the physics by a small
delta.

And the idea is that if it can if it can
And the idea is that if it can if it can
behave under all sorts of different

behave well generally.
behave well generally.
We'll also do the same type of stuff for
We'll also do the same type of stuff for
like the drone size and so on and so
like the drone size and so on and so
forth.
I'm going to try to do this without
I'm going to try to do this without
making it any heavier or any harder for
making it any heavier or any harder for
you guys to use.
you guys to use.
That's the goal.
That's the goal.
So I'm running uh research side support.
Perfectly reasonable
plot li. Yeah, we're just not going to
plot li. Yeah, we're just not going to
try to like worry about it too much
try to like worry about it too much
initially though, right? like
initially though, right? like
over modularizing is just the way that
over modularizing is just the way that
you break everything. I don't want to do
you break everything. I don't want to do
that. I just want to have the physics
that. I just want to have the physics
separated cleanly because of the
separated cleanly because of the
randomization work

just so we're not like know copy pasting
just so we're not like know copy pasting
all the lines into the file and like
all the lines into the file and like
having two different versions of physics
delay largely unnecessary. Uh I actually
delay largely unnecessary. Uh I actually
don't know about that. It depends on how
don't know about that. It depends on how
good of a controller you have.
Like I think you still might need to do
Like I think you still might need to do
something with if it's like 50 ms delay
something with if it's like 50 ms delay
that might be a lot, right?
If you get like 10 ms delay, I think we
If you get like 10 ms delay, I think we
should be good.

I just don't know like with 50.
I just don't know like with 50.
Also, my mic is super loud. Hang on.

Let's not clip. Let's not clip the mic
Let's not clip. Let's not clip the mic
too much.
There we go.
Yeah. Plus, this is kind of chill today.
Yeah. Plus, this is kind of chill today.
We kind of just get to like chill and
We kind of just get to like chill and
improve our own code.
improve our own code.
Just invest a little bit into the uh
Just invest a little bit into the uh
the core.
transmitter is really good, but we need

to see.
Uh delay is like slightly inconvenient.
Uh delay is like slightly inconvenient.
But it's not that bad.
I think that the best thing we can do is
I think that the best thing we can do is
in parallel if you guys get the drone
in parallel if you guys get the drone
flying and you can like run commands on
flying and you can like run commands on

it
then um
then um
and I can get the sim to be really

robust.
robust.
We should be pretty pretty good.
Oops.
Welcome to all the YouTube folks, the
Welcome to all the YouTube folks, the
people who just got here. We're
people who just got here. We're
currently working on the uh well both of
currently working on the uh well both of
the drone environments.
One of which is
One of which is
uh this warm sim right here and the
uh this warm sim right here and the
other of which is a racing environment
other of which is a racing environment
that looks like
like this.
like this.
We're doing a little bit of work on just
We're doing a little bit of work on just
getting the code to be easier and
getting the code to be easier and
cleaner across both of these. And then
cleaner across both of these. And then
we're going to do some work on domain
we're going to do some work on domain
randomization that's going to make it a
randomization that's going to make it a
heck of a lot easier to make this work
heck of a lot easier to make this work
on a real drone.
on a real drone.
In fact, you know, one thing that I
In fact, you know, one thing that I
think is going to be really cool about
think is going to be really cool about
this is if I do this correctly, it
this is if I do this correctly, it
should work on like a ton of different
should work on like a ton of different
types of drones. Like we probably the
types of drones. Like we probably the
best case scenario, right, is that we'll
best case scenario, right, is that we'll
just be able to buy different drones and
just be able to buy different drones and
hook this up and not even really have to
hook this up and not even really have to
do any work specific to each drone.
do any work specific to each drone.
Are you planning to track the drone
Are you planning to track the drone
position back relative to the start
position back relative to the start
position? Yeah. So, for now,
position? Yeah. So, for now,
right for now, we're probably just going
right for now, we're probably just going
to do everything relative. Um, so we'll
to do everything relative. Um, so we'll
just see if we can like get it to fly
just see if we can like get it to fly
around in some patterns. We are going to
around in some patterns. We are going to
have to do perception for the real
have to do perception for the real
hardware at some point, but like it's
hardware at some point, but like it's
not going to be end to end RL division,
not going to be end to end RL division,
right? It's probably just going to be
right? It's probably just going to be
some sort of basic state estimation at
some sort of basic state estimation at
least to start.
Welcome By, welcome Jason.
I'm just it's worth spending some time
I'm just it's worth spending some time
cleaning this up because we're actually
cleaning this up because we're actually
going to use this for
going to use this for
quite a bit of stuff
quite a bit of stuff
and um
and um
I don't want to make like I don't want
I don't want to make like I don't want
this code to be a mess. Just causes us
this code to be a mess. Just causes us
problems.
problems.
To be fair, they submitted me Finn and
To be fair, they submitted me Finn and
Sam submitted me very clean code. Um, I
Sam submitted me very clean code. Um, I
kind of made a mess of it in the process
kind of made a mess of it in the process
of making it multi- aent, but like it
of making it multi- aent, but like it
should be very possible to keep it m
should be very possible to keep it m
like to make it multi- aent and just as
like to make it multi- aent and just as
simple as before, if not simpler
Oh, that's so funny. Ghost uh ghost TTY
Oh, that's so funny. Ghost uh ghost TTY
renders it renders these arrows as like
renders it renders these arrows as like
the arrow character in the term. It's
the arrow character in the term. It's
funny.
Okay, so this now works again.
Conveniently, we have the pre-trained
Conveniently, we have the pre-trained
model loaded into C, so I can know
model loaded into C, so I can know
exactly if I break it. Right. As long as
exactly if I break it. Right. As long as
I don't modify ops, I shouldn't have to
I don't modify ops, I shouldn't have to
break it at all.
break it at all.
Let's take a look through here. We still
Let's take a look through here. We still
have 500 lines of stuff somehow. And a
have 500 lines of stuff somehow. And a
lot of this we should be able to
a lot a lot of this we should be able to
a lot a lot of this we should be able to
kind of just stick into the main
kind of just stick into the main
uh the main thing.
Let's do if we just assume we make the
Let's do if we just assume we make the
end logic multi- aent.
end logic multi- aent.
We assume we make it multi- aent by
We assume we make it multi- aent by
default.
I think we should just assume we make it
I think we should just assume we make it
multi- aent by default, right?
We'll separate out stuff like collision
We'll separate out stuff like collision
checking, right?
checking, right?
I am new. Are you writing an N?
I am new. Are you writing an N?
Uh, I'm editing an N.
Uh, I'm editing an N.
I'm definitely making changes to an N.
I'm definitely making changes to an N.
Drone racing ends and drone swarming
Drone racing ends and drone swarming
ends. Both of these.
Oh, yeah. Also, for the new folks around
Oh, yeah. Also, for the new folks around
here, we do have there's like 25 plus
here, we do have there's like 25 plus
pages of uh reinforcement learning intro
pages of uh reinforcement learning intro
material that will go live as soon as
material that will go live as soon as
this hits 10K. So go ahead and follow
this hits 10K. So go ahead and follow
this on X if you want RL content and you
this on X if you want RL content and you
want that guide.
Yeah, I think that if we just like
if we assume it's multi- aent
if we assume it's multi- aent
then basically
almost all this code should just be
almost all this code should just be
directly usable, right?
directly usable, right?
Pretty
Pretty
much the actual code here, this drone
much the actual code here, this drone
race code is just going to be like the
race code is just going to be like the
100 lines or whatever it is to wire it
100 lines or whatever it is to wire it
together.
together.
We can probably get most of this
We can probably get most of this
uh most of this code to be separated out
uh most of this code to be separated out
cleanly.
Take a little bit of work, but we can do
Take a little bit of work, but we can do
it. And it's worth the it's worth doing
it. And it's worth the it's worth doing
the work.
Let's like look for end in here. We
Let's like look for end in here. We
don't use the end until the out of
don't use the end until the out of
bounds checks at all.
So we do OB check at the end.
Then all of this logic down to here just
Then all of this logic down to here just
goes into a move function.
So we can clamp the actions.
Okay. And now this move drone
The ring stuff is a bit more
The ring stuff is a bit more
complicated,
but this as is should work, right?
Did I mess up?
I forgot the comma.
Okay, so this still works. Yeah,
this function is going into the drone
this function is going into the drone
level.
We can probably get the ring logic to be
We can probably get the ring logic to be
standalone if we try.
It's just the fact that that's hardcoded
It's just the fact that that's hardcoded
right now, right?
Oh yeah, this is just like
Oh yeah, this is just like
jank, right?
jank, right?
Yeah, this is just jank the way this is
Yeah, this is just jank the way this is
written.
Okay. So, this is now.
Yeah. Pause and normal,
Yeah. Pause and normal,
right?
Okay. Yeah, I didn't realize that this
Okay. Yeah, I didn't realize that this
was done this way.
That's better. Let's see if I broke
That's better. Let's see if I broke
anything in the process of doing that.
No, not at all. Okay, so that's like the
No, not at all. Okay, so that's like the
checks are actually very simple. It was
checks are actually very simple. It was
just really verbose because they didn't
just really verbose because they didn't
make a ring variable.
So we can do
valid. invalid.
So, we can just make like a check ring
So, we can just make like a check ring
or whatever.
ready to float.
I see.
I see.
So all I have to do is I have to take
So all I have to do is I have to take
more of this logic and put it in there.
more of this logic and put it in there.
Okay.
Okay.
So like all this
So like all this
somehow
goes like here.
and then this we'll make this a float.
and then this we'll make this a float.
Okay.
And
return one
and then what I'll do I see what we're
and then what I'll do I see what we're
going to do
going to do
so we'll here what we'll do is we'll do
so we'll here what we'll do is we'll do
float reward
check ring
check ring
do r start ring
okay and then like something like this
okay and then like something like this
so we'll do if reward
so we'll do if reward
Z
is equal to
the reward is less than This
rewards greater than zero.
We set the terminal. We add log
We set the terminal. We add log
like this.
Okay.
Okay.
Something like this should be fine.
Clarity.
That's pretty clean.
Red predefined range. This
nonvoid function does not return a
nonvoid function does not return a
value.
turn zero.
And this still works.
Didn't break anything.
Now I think we know the uh the routine
Now I think we know the uh the routine
here, right? This just goes into drone
here, right? This just goes into drone
li now.
We got 300 lines. I'm fine with the
We got 300 lines. I'm fine with the
drone li being a little longer if it's
drone li being a little longer if it's
going to include all the objects, right?
going to include all the objects, right?
Cuz we'll probably put like collision
Cuz we'll probably put like collision
obstacles in there. We can put like
obstacles in there. We can put like
sphere collision obstacles, right? So,
sphere collision obstacles, right? So,
it has to like route around an obstacle
it has to like route around an obstacle
field. We can do lots of stuff
technically, right? We could do like,
technically, right? We could do like,
you know, like the Asteroids game. We
you know, like the Asteroids game. We
could do that with the drone. That'd be
could do that with the drone. That'd be
pretty cool.
pretty cool.
Actually, we should do that. Like I
Actually, we should do that. Like I
actually have um like asteroids thing
actually have um like asteroids thing
but with real drone physics.
Be cool.
Be cool.
Okay. What else is in here?
probably all this stuff about camera
probably all this stuff about camera
control
I mean this is directly copy pasted
I mean this is directly copy pasted
right
right
just do this
just do this
it's literally the same thing.
it's literally the same thing.
We might want to do like separate stuff
We might want to do like separate stuff
later, right?
But we'll for now we'll just put it into
But we'll for now we'll just put it into
drone lib.
Oh, but we don't have the client
Oh, but we don't have the client
defined, so we can't actually do that.
defined, so we can't actually do that.
Yeah, actually that's a little less
Yeah, actually that's a little less
trivial,
trivial,
at least for now.
at least for now.
We've already made this a heck of a lot
We've already made this a heck of a lot
easier though.
Let me just make the other file like the
Let me just make the other file like the
drone swarm work and then so we don't
drone swarm work and then so we don't
spend too long just refactoring right
spend too long just refactoring right
now. We'll do we'll start on a little
now. We'll do we'll start on a little
randomization type stuff.
I should have gotten a policy in here,
I should have gotten a policy in here,
but it's okay.
but it's okay.
So we do drone swarm
and where are the dynamics?
Yeah, you see I have the exact exact
Yeah, you see I have the exact exact
same dynamics here.
same dynamics here.
It's a little strong.
So idea here should be
So idea here should be
just do this
move drone.
Yeah. And then what I have to do is I
Yeah. And then what I have to do is I
have to copy. I have to be very careful
have to copy. I have to be very careful
with this actually. So this is what I'm
with this actually. So this is what I'm
going to do.
Okay, so this still works. So now we
Okay, so this still works. So now we
have the movement function with all the
have the movement function with all the
physics.
I'm going to do this. We'll do this for
I'm going to do this. We'll do this for
drone race even.
So the things to randomize here, right?
We want to randomize quite a bit of this
We want to randomize quite a bit of this
stuff. I'm trying to think what we want
stuff. I'm trying to think what we want
to randomize per episode versus what we
to randomize per episode versus what we
want to randomize per step.
want to randomize per step.
going to do a quick little brief
going to do a quick little brief

I can do like a quick little

So the paper to read for domain

it's this result.
it's this result.
I was at OpenAI when this work was being

Um but if you look at what this is, you
Um but if you look at what this is, you
see how they just have tons of different
see how they just have tons of different
versions of this. You don't just
versions of this. You don't just
randomize the color, you randomize the

the idea is that you can't exactly
the idea is that you can't exactly
simulate the real world,

right? You can do your best to try to
right? You can do your best to try to
simulate the real world exactly, but
simulate the real world exactly, but
you're going to fail. Now, what you
you're going to fail. Now, what you
might be able to do, right, is you might

be able to make a noisy sim where like

Uh, this is a very very effective

These are actually very big

Keep in mind like the RL wasn't as good
Keep in mind like the RL wasn't as good
back then, so they had to really crank
back then, so they had to really crank
this to make this thing work. can also
this to make this thing work. can also
like humanoid hands are not super easy
like humanoid hands are not super easy
either. It's like a pretty high degree
either. It's like a pretty high degree

So actually I'd say most of the problem
So actually I'd say most of the problem
of humanoids is in the hands, not the
of humanoids is in the hands, not the
rest of the robot
rest of the robot
and more degrees of freedom in the hands
and more degrees of freedom in the hands
and the rest of the robot for most
and the rest of the robot for most
models.
Okay.
Okay.
So knowing that
I think we do a per episode
I think we do a per episode
randomization
randomization
it'll be easier and I think it'll cover
it'll be easier and I think it'll cover
pretty much the whole use case.
We will see if I'm correct on that. But
We will see if I'm correct on that. But
I think it should cover just about the
I think it should cover just about the
whole use case.
Do you recommend reinforcement learning?
Do you recommend reinforcement learning?
Is that the original book or is that a
Is that the original book or is that a
new book? Is that like the original
new book? Is that like the original
Sutton and Bardo book or is that a new
Sutton and Bardo book or is that a new
one?
Yeah, this is the original book. So,
Yeah, this is the original book. So,
it really depends, Jason.
it really depends, Jason.
If you have a mathematically heavy
If you have a mathematically heavy
background and a weak programming
background and a weak programming
background, you might find that a decent
background, you might find that a decent
way to learn. The thing is it covers a
way to learn. The thing is it covers a
ton of mathematical background. Um,
ton of mathematical background. Um,
which is good,
which is good,
but at least the way that I've
but at least the way that I've
approached things, it's most of the math
approached things, it's most of the math
doesn't actually work. So, it's going to
doesn't actually work. So, it's going to
give you the impression that
give you the impression that
reinforcement learning is like this very
reinforcement learning is like this very
well theoretically justified, cleancut
well theoretically justified, cleancut
field, and it's really not. like none of
field, and it's really not. like none of
the math actually works.
Where I've come from, I found it way
Where I've come from, I found it way
easier to just treat reinforcement
easier to just treat reinforcement
learning as an almost purely empirical
learning as an almost purely empirical
field, right? Like an almost purely
field, right? Like an almost purely
empirical field. Just completely ignore
empirical field. Just completely ignore
the MDP formalism of everything. Yeah,
the MDP formalism of everything. Yeah,
we still we still write some formulas,
we still we still write some formulas,
but they're models more than anything
but they're models more than anything
else, and they're like really bad models
else, and they're like really bad models
at the best of times.
at the best of times.
If you look at my quick start guide,
If you look at my quick start guide,
you're going to see the types of things
you're going to see the types of things
that I generally recommend to newcomers,
that I generally recommend to newcomers,
which are actually a lot more accessible
which are actually a lot more accessible
mathematically and are going to get you
mathematically and are going to get you
writing a lot more code on things that
writing a lot more code on things that
work very quickly. So, if you check my
work very quickly. So, if you check my
quick start guide, that's a good
quick start guide, that's a good
resource. You can you can decide from
resource. You can you can decide from
there what you think on the more formal
there what you think on the more formal
material. Also, probably within the next
material. Also, probably within the next
day or two, as soon as this hits 10K,
day or two, as soon as this hits 10K,
as soon as this number hits 10K, I'm
as soon as this number hits 10K, I'm
releasing my own guide, which is like 25
releasing my own guide, which is like 25
pages of material on uh programming, ML
pages of material on uh programming, ML
engineering, and then mostly the
engineering, and then mostly the
majority of the material is on how to
majority of the material is on how to
learn reinforcement learning. It's like
learn reinforcement learning. It's like
a very step-by-step guide on read this,
a very step-by-step guide on read this,
implement this, so on and so forth.
I didn't miss any meetings today. I hope
I didn't miss any meetings today. I hope
right.
right.
No,
it's funny.
Hey Tyler,
Hey Tyler,
welcome.
We are doing drone things today.
We are doing drone things today.
Oh yeah, I forget who it was, but there
Oh yeah, I forget who it was, but there
is a second um we've got like a second
is a second um we've got like a second
physicist around who's been watching
physicist around who's been watching
some of the streams.
some of the streams.
That was a cool thing.
I say we just make all these things
I say we just make all these things
properties of the drone,
properties of the drone,
right? And we just make all these things
right? And we just make all these things
properties of the drone.
We're not bothered as long as it works.
We're not bothered as long as it works.
I'm trying to make it also very simple
I'm trying to make it also very simple
as well.
as well.
We're going to make these properties of
We're going to make these properties of
the drone.
We'll do like an init drone thing.
Okay.
Okay.
And then we'll just do
And then we'll just do
float,
domain randomization.
And you know what we can even do? I'll
And you know what we can even do? I'll
tell you what. We
know I don't want to leave these
know I don't want to leave these
constants in as the problem.
Keep the unit comments. Oh yeah. Oops.
Keep the unit comments. Oh yeah. Oops.
My bad.
Okay. Do we have like rand?
Okay. Do we have like rand?
Yeah. Rand F.
Uh, float RNG equals
D.
I should probably do like base instead
I should probably do like base instead
of doing it this way. Yeah, let's do it
of doing it this way. Yeah, let's do it
this way.
this way.
Hang on.
That way we don't drive you guys totally
That way we don't drive you guys totally
crazy.
crazy.
I just need to make sure I change the
I just need to make sure I change the
names of these because otherwise like
names of these because otherwise like
you know there's going something is
you know there's going something is
still going to be using the originals.
Okay. So that domain randomizes the
Okay. So that domain randomizes the
entire the entire drone
DT can stay the same.
DT can stay the same.
I think DT is going to need to get
I think DT is going to need to get
randomized, but
DT might even need to get randomized
DT might even need to get randomized
every step, honestly,
cuz you're not going to have precise
cuz you're not going to have precise
control intervals.
control intervals.
But we're going to just like start like
But we're going to just like start like
this.
I mean once we get this hooked up
I mean once we get this hooked up
correctly it's actually running domain
correctly it's actually running domain
randomization experiments can be made
randomization experiments can be made
very very easy if you know how to do it
very very easy if you know how to do it
correctly. It's very hard if you don't
Yeah. So here we have
these norms.
these norms.
This should not break the policy though.
This should not break the policy though.
At least it won't break it when we set
At least it won't break it when we set
DR to zero. That's the goal. Like the
DR to zero. That's the goal. Like the
goal is that the policy shouldn't break
goal is that the policy shouldn't break
until we crank DR up
until we crank DR up
RPM.
Well, that's a bit much, huh?
Well, that's a bit much, huh?
That's funny.
All right, let's uh
let's do 0.0F.
Okay, so this is look with no domain
Okay, so this is look with no domain
randomization. It works perfectly. I
randomization. It works perfectly. I
suspect I just did it kind of stupidly.
Yeah, see this is plus RNG.
Yeah, see this is plus RNG.
This should be 1.0F
This should be 1.0F
minus DR and 1.0F plus DR. And then it
minus DR and 1.0F plus DR. And then it
should be times RNG.
I wanted to do 10% randomization not
I wanted to do 10% randomization not
not.1 flat randomization.
Okay.
Uhoh.
Uhoh.
My computer just froze.
My computer just froze.
That's weird.

Kind: captions

Okay,
let me go delete all the crap post that
let me go delete all the crap post that
this thing just automatically made for
this thing just automatically made for
me.
My bad, guys. It's just like
there.
This should hopefully be good.
I think it's just our wired internet
I think it's just our wired internet
just being crapped here. We'll try it on
just being crapped here. We'll try it on
Wi-Fi, which ironically should be more
Wi-Fi, which ironically should be more
stable.
All right. So, we have our drone.h
We should be able to get rid of all this
We should be able to get rid of all this
stuff.

including
the range.
We're going to rename the MV, I guess to
We're going to rename the MV, I guess to
drone race.
Make sure the stream is stable.
Make sure the stream is stable.
Looks good.
The chat didn't die, did it?
No, I think it's okay.
No, I think it's okay.

Lovely.
Yeah, you're right. Let's see. This is
Yeah, you're right. Let's see. This is
why I don't do it cuz literally every
why I don't do it cuz literally every
time it does anything, I have to redo
time it does anything, I have to redo
it. But
we'll do that.
All right. Whatever.
It should hopefully be stable now. I'm
It should hopefully be stable now. I'm
pretty sure it's just that we have like
pretty sure it's just that we have like
jank Ethernet cables, like jank
jank Ethernet cables, like jank
connections or jank something here.

Whatever. I don't want to deal with it.
Whatever. I don't want to deal with it.
It should be good. We'll just do it on
It should be good. We'll just do it on
Wi-Fi. Should be good enough.
Okay, so we need this random ring
Okay, so we need this random ring
function
I must have gotten rid of. Let me go
I must have gotten rid of. Let me go
grab it.
Oh yeah, star the puffer lip. Star the
Oh yeah, star the puffer lip. Star the
puffer if you haven't. It helps us out a
puffer if you haven't. It helps us out a
lot. It's free.
I say we just put this into the um
I say we just put this into the um
drone lab, right?
Oh, that actually already works. Cool.
So, yeah. So, that wasn't that hard,
So, yeah. So, that wasn't that hard,
right?
I don't know if it's actually using the
I don't know if it's actually using the
drone.
Yeah, it's probably not using the drone
Yeah, it's probably not using the drone
though. It's just using these like
though. It's just using these like
random functions.
random functions.
So, let's fix that.
Yeah. You see this has like position,
Yeah. You see this has like position,
previous position.
previous position.
So, what we're going to do is we'll just
So, what we're going to do is we'll just
do drone drone like this.
And drone does have position, right?
And drone does have position, right?
Let's just check.
So, this has position.
What's it need previous position for?
Oh, it does need previous position up.
Oh, it does need previous position up.
Okay, so we'll just do
three previous position.
Holy Yeah, there's going to have to be a
Holy Yeah, there's going to have to be a
lot of substitutions.
What's going to happen though
What's going to happen though
eventually, right? We're going to get to
eventually, right? We're going to get to
a point where these look similar enough
a point where these look similar enough
that we can just make it like either one
that we can just make it like either one
end with configs
end with configs
or something.
or something.
We can kind of just train on a ton of
We can kind of just train on a ton of
different tasks. Like the RL is kind of
different tasks. Like the RL is kind of
good enough that if we just give it a
good enough that if we just give it a
lot of tasks for drones, as long as it's
lot of tasks for drones, as long as it's
fast and they're reasonably posed, it
fast and they're reasonably posed, it
should just work.
should just work.
The RL side's very good at this point.
The RL side's very good at this point.
It's mostly just about getting the Sims
It's mostly just about getting the Sims
uh to be built better and faster.
We're uh planning on improving the
We're uh planning on improving the
physics.
physics.
Awesome.
Awesome.
So, my plan, Sam, you can tell me if you
So, my plan, Sam, you can tell me if you
think that this makes sense here. So,
think that this makes sense here. So,
we're going to want to do a lot of
we're going to want to do a lot of
different stuff with these drones to
different stuff with these drones to
test them out. We're gonna have to do
test them out. We're gonna have to do
like the ring racing task. We'll do
like the ring racing task. We'll do
swarming stuff. We'll do like obstacle
swarming stuff. We'll do like obstacle
avoidance. We can do tons of stuff. I'm
avoidance. We can do tons of stuff. I'm
gonna try to I don't want to modularize
gonna try to I don't want to modularize
stuff a whole bunch to the point that it
stuff a whole bunch to the point that it
becomes heavy. All I want to do is just
becomes heavy. All I want to do is just
take like the drone physics and all the
take like the drone physics and all the
parts about the drone control and then
parts about the drone control and then
separate those from the task specifics.
separate those from the task specifics.
So, we can just have a couple hundred
So, we can just have a couple hundred
line like drone.h with all the physics
line like drone.h with all the physics
or whatever. And then we can just
or whatever. And then we can just
include that in whatever other Sims we
include that in whatever other Sims we
want to build around it, right? Whatever
want to build around it, right? Whatever
other task, whatever other Sims. And
other task, whatever other Sims. And
maybe eventually we will converge on
maybe eventually we will converge on
like one set of observations or, you
like one set of observations or, you
know, maybe we'll find other ways to
know, maybe we'll find other ways to
unify things. But I'm not going to worry
unify things. But I'm not going to worry
about that too much initially. I just
about that too much initially. I just
want to make sure that we have one spot
want to make sure that we have one spot
for at least like the physics and such.
for at least like the physics and such.
Um, and I think that'll help us out
Um, and I think that'll help us out
quite a bit because then I'm going to
quite a bit because then I'm going to
start like I'm going to start
start like I'm going to start
introducing randomized versions of
introducing randomized versions of
these, right? Or like I'm going to add
these, right? Or like I'm going to add
randomization parameters.
randomization parameters.
So you can just say all right uh
So you can just say all right uh
whenever the drone moves, right? Let's
whenever the drone moves, right? Let's
just screw with the physics by a small
just screw with the physics by a small
delta.
delta.
And the idea is that if it can if it can
And the idea is that if it can if it can
behave under all sorts of different
behave under all sorts of different
small perturbations, it should just
small perturbations, it should just
behave well generally.
behave well generally.
We'll also do the same type of stuff for
We'll also do the same type of stuff for
like the drone size and so on and so
like the drone size and so on and so
forth.
I'm going to try to do this without
I'm going to try to do this without
making it any heavier or any harder for
making it any heavier or any harder for
you guys to use.
you guys to use.
That's the goal.
That's the goal.
So I'm running uh research side support.
Perfectly reasonable
plot li. Yeah, we're just not going to
plot li. Yeah, we're just not going to
try to like worry about it too much
try to like worry about it too much
initially though, right? like
initially though, right? like
over modularizing is just the way that
over modularizing is just the way that
you break everything. I don't want to do
you break everything. I don't want to do
that. I just want to have the physics
that. I just want to have the physics
separated cleanly because of the
separated cleanly because of the
randomization work
randomization work
just so we're not like know copy pasting
just so we're not like know copy pasting
all the lines into the file and like
all the lines into the file and like
having two different versions of physics
delay largely unnecessary. Uh I actually
delay largely unnecessary. Uh I actually
don't know about that. It depends on how
don't know about that. It depends on how
good of a controller you have.
Like I think you still might need to do
Like I think you still might need to do
something with if it's like 50 ms delay
something with if it's like 50 ms delay
that might be a lot, right?
If you get like 10 ms delay, I think we
If you get like 10 ms delay, I think we
should be good.
should be good.
I just don't know like with 50.
I just don't know like with 50.
Also, my mic is super loud. Hang on.
Also, my mic is super loud. Hang on.
Let's not clip. Let's not clip the mic
Let's not clip. Let's not clip the mic
too much.
There we go.
Yeah. Plus, this is kind of chill today.
Yeah. Plus, this is kind of chill today.
We kind of just get to like chill and
We kind of just get to like chill and
improve our own code.
improve our own code.
Just invest a little bit into the uh
Just invest a little bit into the uh
the core.
transmitter is really good, but we need
transmitter is really good, but we need
to see.
to see.
Uh delay is like slightly inconvenient.
Uh delay is like slightly inconvenient.
But it's not that bad.
I think that the best thing we can do is
I think that the best thing we can do is
in parallel if you guys get the drone
in parallel if you guys get the drone
flying and you can like run commands on
flying and you can like run commands on
it
it
then um
then um
and I can get the sim to be really
and I can get the sim to be really
robust.
robust.
We should be pretty pretty good.
Oops.
Welcome to all the YouTube folks, the
Welcome to all the YouTube folks, the
people who just got here. We're
people who just got here. We're
currently working on the uh well both of
currently working on the uh well both of
the drone environments.
One of which is
One of which is
uh this warm sim right here and the
uh this warm sim right here and the
other of which is a racing environment
other of which is a racing environment
that looks like
like this.
like this.
We're doing a little bit of work on just
We're doing a little bit of work on just
getting the code to be easier and
getting the code to be easier and
cleaner across both of these. And then
cleaner across both of these. And then
we're going to do some work on domain
we're going to do some work on domain
randomization that's going to make it a
randomization that's going to make it a
heck of a lot easier to make this work
heck of a lot easier to make this work
on a real drone.
on a real drone.
In fact, you know, one thing that I
In fact, you know, one thing that I
think is going to be really cool about
think is going to be really cool about
this is if I do this correctly, it
this is if I do this correctly, it
should work on like a ton of different
should work on like a ton of different
types of drones. Like we probably the
types of drones. Like we probably the
best case scenario, right, is that we'll
best case scenario, right, is that we'll
just be able to buy different drones and
just be able to buy different drones and
hook this up and not even really have to
hook this up and not even really have to
do any work specific to each drone.
do any work specific to each drone.
Are you planning to track the drone
Are you planning to track the drone
position back relative to the start
position back relative to the start
position? Yeah. So, for now,
position? Yeah. So, for now,
right for now, we're probably just going
right for now, we're probably just going
to do everything relative. Um, so we'll
to do everything relative. Um, so we'll
just see if we can like get it to fly
just see if we can like get it to fly
around in some patterns. We are going to
around in some patterns. We are going to
have to do perception for the real
have to do perception for the real
hardware at some point, but like it's
hardware at some point, but like it's
not going to be end to end RL division,
not going to be end to end RL division,
right? It's probably just going to be
right? It's probably just going to be
some sort of basic state estimation at
some sort of basic state estimation at
least to start.
Welcome By, welcome Jason.
I'm just it's worth spending some time
I'm just it's worth spending some time
cleaning this up because we're actually
cleaning this up because we're actually
going to use this for
going to use this for
quite a bit of stuff
quite a bit of stuff
and um
and um
I don't want to make like I don't want
I don't want to make like I don't want
this code to be a mess. Just causes us
this code to be a mess. Just causes us
problems.
problems.
To be fair, they submitted me Finn and
To be fair, they submitted me Finn and
Sam submitted me very clean code. Um, I
Sam submitted me very clean code. Um, I
kind of made a mess of it in the process
kind of made a mess of it in the process
of making it multi- aent, but like it
of making it multi- aent, but like it
should be very possible to keep it m
should be very possible to keep it m
like to make it multi- aent and just as
like to make it multi- aent and just as
simple as before, if not simpler
Oh, that's so funny. Ghost uh ghost TTY
Oh, that's so funny. Ghost uh ghost TTY
renders it renders these arrows as like
renders it renders these arrows as like
the arrow character in the term. It's
the arrow character in the term. It's
funny.
Okay, so this now works again.
Conveniently, we have the pre-trained
Conveniently, we have the pre-trained
model loaded into C, so I can know
model loaded into C, so I can know
exactly if I break it. Right. As long as
exactly if I break it. Right. As long as
I don't modify ops, I shouldn't have to
I don't modify ops, I shouldn't have to
break it at all.
break it at all.
Let's take a look through here. We still
Let's take a look through here. We still
have 500 lines of stuff somehow. And a
have 500 lines of stuff somehow. And a
lot of this we should be able to
a lot a lot of this we should be able to
a lot a lot of this we should be able to
kind of just stick into the main
kind of just stick into the main
uh the main thing.
Let's do if we just assume we make the
Let's do if we just assume we make the
end logic multi- aent.
end logic multi- aent.
We assume we make it multi- aent by
We assume we make it multi- aent by
default.
I think we should just assume we make it
I think we should just assume we make it
multi- aent by default, right?
We'll separate out stuff like collision
We'll separate out stuff like collision
checking, right?
checking, right?
I am new. Are you writing an N?
I am new. Are you writing an N?
Uh, I'm editing an N.
Uh, I'm editing an N.
I'm definitely making changes to an N.
I'm definitely making changes to an N.
Drone racing ends and drone swarming
Drone racing ends and drone swarming
ends. Both of these.
Oh, yeah. Also, for the new folks around
Oh, yeah. Also, for the new folks around
here, we do have there's like 25 plus
here, we do have there's like 25 plus
pages of uh reinforcement learning intro
pages of uh reinforcement learning intro
material that will go live as soon as
material that will go live as soon as
this hits 10K. So go ahead and follow
this hits 10K. So go ahead and follow
this on X if you want RL content and you
this on X if you want RL content and you
want that guide.
Yeah, I think that if we just like
if we assume it's multi- aent
if we assume it's multi- aent
then basically
almost all this code should just be
almost all this code should just be
directly usable, right?
directly usable, right?
Pretty
Pretty
much the actual code here, this drone
much the actual code here, this drone
race code is just going to be like the
race code is just going to be like the
100 lines or whatever it is to wire it
100 lines or whatever it is to wire it
together.
together.
We can probably get most of this
We can probably get most of this
uh most of this code to be separated out
uh most of this code to be separated out
cleanly.
Take a little bit of work, but we can do
Take a little bit of work, but we can do
it. And it's worth the it's worth doing
it. And it's worth the it's worth doing
the work.
Let's like look for end in here. We
Let's like look for end in here. We
don't use the end until the out of
don't use the end until the out of
bounds checks at all.
So we do OB check at the end.
Then all of this logic down to here just
Then all of this logic down to here just
goes into a move function.
So we can clamp the actions.
Okay. And now this move drone
The ring stuff is a bit more
The ring stuff is a bit more
complicated,
but this as is should work, right?
Did I mess up?
I forgot the comma.
Okay, so this still works. Yeah,
this function is going into the drone
this function is going into the drone
level.
We can probably get the ring logic to be
We can probably get the ring logic to be
standalone if we try.
It's just the fact that that's hardcoded
It's just the fact that that's hardcoded
right now, right?
Oh yeah, this is just like
Oh yeah, this is just like
jank, right?
jank, right?
Yeah, this is just jank the way this is
Yeah, this is just jank the way this is
written.
Okay. So, this is now.
Yeah. Pause and normal,
Yeah. Pause and normal,
right?
Okay. Yeah, I didn't realize that this
Okay. Yeah, I didn't realize that this
was done this way.
That's better. Let's see if I broke
That's better. Let's see if I broke
anything in the process of doing that.
No, not at all. Okay, so that's like the
No, not at all. Okay, so that's like the
checks are actually very simple. It was
checks are actually very simple. It was
just really verbose because they didn't
just really verbose because they didn't
make a ring variable.
So we can do
valid. invalid.
So, we can just make like a check ring
So, we can just make like a check ring
or whatever.
ready to float.
I see.
I see.
So all I have to do is I have to take
So all I have to do is I have to take
more of this logic and put it in there.
more of this logic and put it in there.
Okay.
Okay.
So like all this
So like all this
somehow
goes like here.
and then this we'll make this a float.
and then this we'll make this a float.
Okay.
And
return one
and then what I'll do I see what we're
and then what I'll do I see what we're
going to do
going to do
so we'll here what we'll do is we'll do
so we'll here what we'll do is we'll do
float reward
check ring
check ring
do r start ring
okay and then like something like this
okay and then like something like this
so we'll do if reward
so we'll do if reward
Z
is equal to
the reward is less than This
rewards greater than zero.
We set the terminal. We add log
We set the terminal. We add log
like this.
Okay.
Okay.
Something like this should be fine.
Clarity.
That's pretty clean.
Red predefined range. This
nonvoid function does not return a

turn zero.
And this still works.
Didn't break anything.
Now I think we know the uh the routine
Now I think we know the uh the routine
here, right? This just goes into drone
here, right? This just goes into drone
li now.
We got 300 lines. I'm fine with the
We got 300 lines. I'm fine with the
drone li being a little longer if it's
drone li being a little longer if it's
going to include all the objects, right?
going to include all the objects, right?
Cuz we'll probably put like collision
Cuz we'll probably put like collision
obstacles in there. We can put like
obstacles in there. We can put like
sphere collision obstacles, right? So,
sphere collision obstacles, right? So,
it has to like route around an obstacle
it has to like route around an obstacle
field. We can do lots of stuff
technically, right? We could do like,
technically, right? We could do like,
you know, like the Asteroids game. We
you know, like the Asteroids game. We
could do that with the drone. That'd be
could do that with the drone. That'd be
pretty cool.
pretty cool.
Actually, we should do that. Like I
Actually, we should do that. Like I
actually have um like asteroids thing
actually have um like asteroids thing
but with real drone physics.
Be cool.
Be cool.
Okay. What else is in here?
probably all this stuff about camera
probably all this stuff about camera
control
I mean this is directly copy pasted
I mean this is directly copy pasted
right
right
just do this
just do this
it's literally the same thing.
it's literally the same thing.
We might want to do like separate stuff
We might want to do like separate stuff
later, right?
But we'll for now we'll just put it into
But we'll for now we'll just put it into
drone lib.
Oh, but we don't have the client
Oh, but we don't have the client
defined, so we can't actually do that.
defined, so we can't actually do that.
Yeah, actually that's a little less
Yeah, actually that's a little less
trivial,
trivial,
at least for now.
at least for now.
We've already made this a heck of a lot
We've already made this a heck of a lot
easier though.
Let me just make the other file like the
Let me just make the other file like the
drone swarm work and then so we don't
drone swarm work and then so we don't
spend too long just refactoring right
spend too long just refactoring right
now. We'll do we'll start on a little
now. We'll do we'll start on a little
randomization type stuff.
I should have gotten a policy in here,
I should have gotten a policy in here,
but it's okay.
but it's okay.
So we do drone swarm
and where are the dynamics?
Yeah, you see I have the exact exact
Yeah, you see I have the exact exact
same dynamics here.
same dynamics here.
It's a little strong.
So idea here should be
So idea here should be
just do this
move drone.
Yeah. And then what I have to do is I
Yeah. And then what I have to do is I
have to copy. I have to be very careful
have to copy. I have to be very careful
with this actually. So this is what I'm
with this actually. So this is what I'm
going to do.
Okay, so this still works. So now we
Okay, so this still works. So now we
have the movement function with all the
have the movement function with all the
physics.
I'm going to do this. We'll do this for
I'm going to do this. We'll do this for
drone race even.
So the things to randomize here, right?
We want to randomize quite a bit of this
We want to randomize quite a bit of this
stuff. I'm trying to think what we want
stuff. I'm trying to think what we want
to randomize per episode versus what we
to randomize per episode versus what we
want to randomize per step.
want to randomize per step.
going to do a quick little brief
going to do a quick little brief
introduction to um
I can do like a quick little

Um but if you look at what this is, you
Um but if you look at what this is, you
see how they just have tons of different

the idea is that you can't exactly

right? You can do your best to try to

you're going to fail. Now, what you
you're going to fail. Now, what you
might be able to do, right, is you might

be able to make a noisy sim where like

Uh, this is a very very effective

Keep in mind like the RL wasn't as good
Keep in mind like the RL wasn't as good
back then, so they had to really crank
back then, so they had to really crank
this to make this thing work. can also

like humanoid hands are not super easy
like humanoid hands are not super easy
either. It's like a pretty high degree
either. It's like a pretty high degree

So actually I'd say most of the problem
So actually I'd say most of the problem
of humanoids is in the hands, not the

rest of the robot

and more degrees of freedom in the hands
and more degrees of freedom in the hands
and the rest of the robot for most

Okay.
Okay.
So knowing that
I think we do a per episode

it'll be easier and I think it'll cover
it'll be easier and I think it'll cover
pretty much the whole use case.
We will see if I'm correct on that. But
We will see if I'm correct on that. But
I think it should cover just about the

whole use case.
Do you recommend reinforcement learning?

Is that the original book or is that a

Yeah, this is the original book. So,
Yeah, this is the original book. So,
it really depends, Jason.
it really depends, Jason.
If you have a mathematically heavy
If you have a mathematically heavy
background and a weak programming

way to learn. The thing is it covers a
way to learn. The thing is it covers a
ton of mathematical background. Um,

which is good,
which is good,
but at least the way that I've
but at least the way that I've
approached things, it's most of the math
approached things, it's most of the math
doesn't actually work. So, it's going to

give you the impression that

Where I've come from, I found it way
Where I've come from, I found it way
easier to just treat reinforcement
easier to just treat reinforcement
learning as an almost purely empirical
learning as an almost purely empirical
field, right? Like an almost purely

the MDP formalism of everything. Yeah,
the MDP formalism of everything. Yeah,
we still we still write some formulas,

If you look at my quick start guide,
If you look at my quick start guide,
you're going to see the types of things
you're going to see the types of things
that I generally recommend to newcomers,

which are actually a lot more accessible

writing a lot more code on things that
writing a lot more code on things that
work very quickly. So, if you check my
work very quickly. So, if you check my
quick start guide, that's a good
quick start guide, that's a good

as soon as this number hits 10K, I'm
releasing my own guide, which is like 25
releasing my own guide, which is like 25
pages of material on uh programming, ML

engineering, and then mostly the
majority of the material is on how to
majority of the material is on how to
learn reinforcement learning. It's like
learn reinforcement learning. It's like
a very step-by-step guide on read this,
a very step-by-step guide on read this,
implement this, so on and so forth.
I didn't miss any meetings today. I hope
I didn't miss any meetings today. I hope
right.
right.
No,
it's funny.
Hey Tyler,
Hey Tyler,
welcome.
We are doing drone things today.
We are doing drone things today.
Oh yeah, I forget who it was, but there
Oh yeah, I forget who it was, but there
is a second um we've got like a second
is a second um we've got like a second
physicist around who's been watching
physicist around who's been watching
some of the streams.
some of the streams.
That was a cool thing.
I say we just make all these things
I say we just make all these things
properties of the drone,
properties of the drone,
right? And we just make all these things
right? And we just make all these things
properties of the drone.
We're not bothered as long as it works.
We're not bothered as long as it works.
I'm trying to make it also very simple
I'm trying to make it also very simple
as well.
as well.
We're going to make these properties of
We're going to make these properties of
the drone.
We'll do like an init drone thing.
Okay.
Okay.
And then we'll just do
And then we'll just do
float,
domain randomization.
And you know what we can even do? I'll
And you know what we can even do? I'll
tell you what. We
know I don't want to leave these
know I don't want to leave these
constants in as the problem.
Keep the unit comments. Oh yeah. Oops.
Keep the unit comments. Oh yeah. Oops.
My bad.
Okay. Do we have like rand?
Okay. Do we have like rand?
Yeah. Rand F.
Uh, float RNG equals
D.
I should probably do like base instead
I should probably do like base instead
of doing it this way. Yeah, let's do it
of doing it this way. Yeah, let's do it
this way.
this way.
Hang on.
That way we don't drive you guys totally
That way we don't drive you guys totally
crazy.
crazy.
I just need to make sure I change the
I just need to make sure I change the
names of these because otherwise like
names of these because otherwise like
you know there's going something is
you know there's going something is
still going to be using the originals.
Okay. So that domain randomizes the
Okay. So that domain randomizes the
entire the entire drone
DT can stay the same.
DT can stay the same.
I think DT is going to need to get
I think DT is going to need to get
randomized, but
DT might even need to get randomized
DT might even need to get randomized
every step, honestly,
cuz you're not going to have precise
cuz you're not going to have precise
control intervals.
control intervals.
But we're going to just like start like
But we're going to just like start like
this.
I mean once we get this hooked up
I mean once we get this hooked up
correctly it's actually running domain
correctly it's actually running domain
randomization experiments can be made
randomization experiments can be made
very very easy if you know how to do it
very very easy if you know how to do it
correctly. It's very hard if you don't
Yeah. So here we have
these norms.
these norms.
This should not break the policy though.
This should not break the policy though.
At least it won't break it when we set
At least it won't break it when we set
DR to zero. That's the goal. Like the
DR to zero. That's the goal. Like the
goal is that the policy shouldn't break
goal is that the policy shouldn't break
until we crank DR up
until we crank DR up
RPM.
Well, that's a bit much, huh?
Well, that's a bit much, huh?
That's funny.
All right, let's uh
let's do 0.0F.
Okay, so this is look with no domain
Okay, so this is look with no domain
randomization. It works perfectly. I
randomization. It works perfectly. I
suspect I just did it kind of stupidly.
Yeah, see this is plus RNG.
Yeah, see this is plus RNG.
This should be 1.0F
This should be 1.0F
minus DR and 1.0F plus DR. And then it
minus DR and 1.0F plus DR. And then it
should be times RNG.
I wanted to do 10% randomization not
I wanted to do 10% randomization not
not.1 flat randomization.
Okay.
Uhoh.
Uhoh.
My computer just froze.
My computer just froze.
That's weird.
