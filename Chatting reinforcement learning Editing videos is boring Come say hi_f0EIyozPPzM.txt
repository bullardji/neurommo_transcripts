okay we should be live let's
see
see
yep cool
yep cool
so uh we
so uh we
are going to do a couple quick things
here goal for today just circled back
here goal for today just circled back
with the GPU Drive BS and we're going to
with the GPU Drive BS and we're going to
see if we can fix up that
see if we can fix up that
simulator so
simulator so
that looks
good it's been a while since I've played
good it's been a while since I've played
with
with
this let me see if I can figure this out
this let me see if I can figure this out
um
Docker I think it was on on puffer box
Docker I think it was on on puffer box
one
maybe uh this looks good it has GPU
maybe uh this looks good it has GPU
drive on it
right and this box got rebooted anyway
right and this box got rebooted anyway
so we're fine so um
there's a bunch of stuff here we don't
there's a bunch of stuff here we don't
care about any of this we do care about
care about any of this we do care about
this demo file
this demo file
so the thing that was happening that got
so the thing that was happening that got
me stuck on this
me stuck on this
before hold on let me fix the
before hold on let me fix the
stream uh the thing that happened that
stream uh the thing that happened that
got me stuck on this before was that
got me stuck on this before was that
there's this crash in
there's this crash in
madona uh the basically means
madona uh the basically means
that you can't run sweeps the way you
that you can't run sweeps the way you
normally
would oops you can't run sweeps the way
would oops you can't run sweeps the way
that you normally would because uh you
that you normally would because uh you
can't make multiple copies of the
can't make multiple copies of the
environment it just like it crashes it
environment it just like it crashes it
out of memories it does weird things so
out of memories it does weird things so
what we're going to do to fix this
where's this thing called
where's this thing called
train okay right here elos equals elos
train okay right here elos equals elos
let's
do this will run in a sub
do this will run in a sub
process and now we have to add this
process and now we have to add this
extra
extra
ARG admittedly I don't like floing the
ARG admittedly I don't like floing the
demo file but whatever you know we'll do
demo file but whatever you know we'll do
it for
it for
this sub process equal
false and then what we'll do
is very
is very
gross but uh this is
cheeky that's not what I wanted to do it
cheeky that's not what I wanted to do it
all um let me
see I need to see my other code to see
see I need to see my other code to see
how I want to do
this back in multiprocessing
this back in multiprocessing
[Music]
where is this
thing process multiprocessing import
thing process multiprocessing import
process
and okay so basically what I want to do
and okay so basically what I want to do
is I want to just call this thing um
is I want to just call this thing um
with subprocess false but now it's in a
subprocess b.
start and
then where's the darn process API
p.
p.
jooin where do I get the results out
come on is there not an easy way to get
come on is there not an easy way to get
the results out at the end of a process
the results out at the end of a process
like this it has to be
like this it has to be
right oh I forgot I disabled the chat as
right oh I forgot I disabled the chat as
well let me fix
well let me fix
that just go to the stream
that just go to the stream
view yeah there we go
like this
[Music]
get output of the process function
get output of the process function
python
on subprocess check
on subprocess check
output is is all old
process
process
run join
terminate kill
close is there no way to get the output
close is there no way to get the output
of a
process this is a
process this is a
q I forget that these things are always
q I forget that these things are always
way more obnoxious
way more obnoxious
uh then I would
uh then I would
think hold
think hold
[Music]
[Music]
on maybe this has better
docks is it going to tell me to put it
docks is it going to tell me to put it
into a queue really
yep that's so
yep that's so
dumb that's incredibly
stupid you got to be kidding me
okay is there a way I can do this
okay is there a way I can do this
without making a mess of all this nice
without making a mess of all this nice
code that I've
written we'll just do it we'll just do
written we'll just do it we'll just do
it quick for
now we'll give it a
Q and then
Q and then
uh if Q is not
uh if Q is not
none
you.put stats
yellow
yellow
okay we'll see how this goes so we have
okay we'll see how this goes so we have
uh We've made a subprocess option where
uh We've made a subprocess option where
we just stick all this garbage into a
we just stick all this garbage into a
queue and then we get it back out of the
queue and then we get it back out of the
queue
yeah so now what we're going to do is we
yeah so now what we're going to do is we
will see if we can run GPU drive if I
will see if we can run GPU drive if I
have the thing set up correctly and if I
have the thing set up correctly and if I
can start an actual hyper pram sweep
let's see what this
let's see what this
does and mind you I think I've made uh
does and mind you I think I've made uh
I've made some substantial improvements
I've made some substantial improvements
to our vectorization into other things
to our vectorization into other things
as well since uh I did this originally
200k steps per
200k steps per
second very nice
indeed
so GPU drives 10 mil time
so GPU drives 10 mil time
steps oh they said that there was
steps oh they said that there was
stepanie said that there was
stepanie said that there was
uh you drive they had a a wand B
somewhere
somewhere
[Music]
[Music]
drona
drona
yo where's the one b
wait
wait
where's said there's a wanie somewhere
where's said there's a wanie somewhere
right dependencies
contribution guidelines and WB
report that link points to a learning
report that link points to a learning
Benchmark okay this is
where check the 1B report
where check the 1B report
here okay
I don't know this
I don't know this
is hold
is hold
on we'll log into to the
on we'll log into to the
puffer count which will go
here go like
this and
dang so this is
dang so this is
not you actually can't change whoops
not you actually can't change whoops
let's not do
let's not do
that not have freaking door Dash
oh okay here you can see that this is 10
oh okay here you can see that this is 10
mil steps
right so yeah a 10 mil step should be
fine let's see how fast we can do this I
fine let's see how fast we can do this I
bet we can just do this super
fast 10 mil time steps
Max
episode what is this Max episode
steps wait hold
steps wait hold
on that doesn't make sense
right environments
Max
Max
epis sweep. parameters. m.p
parameters well that's just doesn't
parameters well that's just doesn't
exist right this doesn't exist I don't
exist right this doesn't exist I don't
know why this is here yo Nathan what's
know why this is here yo Nathan what's
up I I didn't know last stream when you
up I I didn't know last stream when you
said like hey check Discord for progress
said like hey check Discord for progress
I thought you were talking about like
I thought you were talking about like
breakout I didn't realize you'd made a
breakout I didn't realize you'd made a
whole mockup of the uh that PVP
whole mockup of the uh that PVP
environment that is awesome I am
environment that is awesome I am
absolutely Ely down to help you with
absolutely Ely down to help you with
that that is
awesome well done
seriously okay this should be
solid uh
TKS just finishing a cup up a couple
TKS just finishing a cup up a couple
things
things
here mode train back
go oh no
go oh no
mode swe carbs vac
native that's it
right we'll see if I messed up or not
really init Cuda
error uh
I
mean what the heck is this right
set Cuda Cuda set device GPU
ID Cuda
free if I run this without a sweep does
free if I run this without a sweep does
it work
okay so this actually runs fine
okay so this actually runs fine
I'm curious then
why it shouldn't error on the first run
right well I have to go for the slightly
right well I have to go for the slightly
more annoying uh option here I want to
more annoying uh option here I want to
just be able to subprocess like this but
just be able to subprocess like this but
I guess I can't do that so I'm going to
I guess I can't do that so I'm going to
have to add
have to add
um what cash back
this should
this should
work and then I have
work and then I have
to man I have to return the V en as well
silly let's get rid of
this okay so we're going to do back end
this okay so we're going to do back end
equal backend right and then this will
equal backend right and then this will
be new
be new
ELO then this will be ven
and I'll have to
and I'll have to
do back it's
none so now the goal is that we just
none so now the goal is that we just
cash the
ven cannot access local variable
ven cannot access local variable
vcm
really why does elos
work but vam
doesn't Somebody explain
doesn't Somebody explain
that Unbound local
this should absolutely work because I
this should absolutely work because I
have right here this is this should be
have right here this is this should be
in scope
in scope
right unless I have like a ve
and oh right here because you can't
and oh right here because you can't
assign to
assign to
it that's why
that's
silly so we'll just do like
silly so we'll just do like
this so that process should not be
true very
silly so it says vam is none
here initialization
here initialization
finished running GPU Drive super fast
speed is very highly
speed is very highly
variable very highly
variable but uh yeah there you go this
variable but uh yeah there you go this
should be done in 20 more
should be done in 20 more
seconds which means we
are what's that 20 times faster than the
are what's that 20 times faster than the
baseline or whatever
got a Need for
Speed how's the stream
Speed how's the stream
doing warming up a bit
GPU Drive torch has no attribute Sim
really
ah because we did close on this
right
right
[Music]
so oh that's an e that's an easy effects
what do we think about
that that should work
right let me start to sweep up
okay so that's first
okay so that's first
experiment now it's doing the final eval
experiment now it's doing the final eval
so it gets an accurate estimate
so it gets an accurate estimate
and
then we get observed value we get up
then we get observed value we get up
time and it
time and it
works yay
that was way easier than I thought it
that was way easier than I thought it
was going to be honestly I'm kind of
was going to be honestly I'm kind of
embarrassed that I just didn't do that
embarrassed that I just didn't do that
to begin
with yeah this
with yeah this
works all right I will be right back and
works all right I will be right back and
then we'll see what this is accomplished
and uh hopefully we'll be able to just
and uh hopefully we'll be able to just
leave this and I'll either edit on the
leave this and I'll either edit on the
video and answer some questions or do
video and answer some questions or do
some other things we'll see what we uh
some other things we'll see what we uh
what we've got let me Discord real
what we've got let me Discord real
quick see if there's an update on any of
quick see if there's an update on any of
these Sims that people have been
these Sims that people have been
building
interesting this guy did some nice work
interesting this guy did some nice work
for me here
I think I'm all caught up with the
I think I'm all caught up with the
Discord
actually yeah
actually yeah
okay we'll leave this be here
okay we'll leave this be here
and I'll be right

welcome how's the end going
I don't know what's up my camera's been
I don't know what's up my camera's been
like a little laggy
lately I think the mini ITX desktop was
lately I think the mini ITX desktop was
a huge
mistake on the bright side it does

prevent me from downloading and uh and
prevent me from downloading and uh and
playing Boulders Gate 3 so having
playing Boulders Gate 3 so having

no fun only
work okay this is good we'll leave this
work okay this is good we'll leave this
for a little
bit GPU Eugene just posted my uh my link
bit GPU Eugene just posted my uh my link
to his slack that's funny
had no time to work on the EV right now
had no time to work on the EV right now
I have to finish bachelor's thesis
I have to finish bachelor's thesis
almost finished few things need to be
almost finished few things need to be
done to make it a bit more similar to
done to make it a bit more similar to
the original
the original
awesome yeah likewise I haven't been
awesome yeah likewise I haven't been
able to Dev properly because these
able to Dev properly because these
freaking
freaking
videos um
videos um
the new one will be done soon I'm
the new one will be done soon I'm
actually just waiting to see if this
actually just waiting to see if this
this does anything um because I think
this does anything um because I think
that I might have a couple bugs in GPU
that I might have a couple bugs in GPU
drive and then I'm going to switch over
drive and then I'm going to switch over
in a little bit to do
in a little bit to do
uh to work on the video once this is for
uh to work on the video once this is for
sure working
it's kind of weird that this thing
doesn't is there a learning progress
doesn't is there a learning progress
happening
it's kind of weird to
see think I should start looking at the
see think I should start looking at the
end and assuming that there's something
end and assuming that there's something
screwy at
least
least
or
or
or I
or I
should get this running locally
should get this running locally
right yeah I should do that I should get
right yeah I should do that I should get
this running
locally I'll give it another minute
locally I'll give it another minute
before I go down that rabbit
before I go down that rabbit
hole we can take a look at
um a couple things
first I'm trying to see where
first I'm trying to see where
um Nathan post his
um Nathan post his
n that's worth
n that's worth
showing oh there there is more stuff for
showing oh there there is more stuff for
me to reply
me to reply
to what happened
here okay that's nice
oh wait he removed the
oh wait he removed the
gift
gift
what he deleted the
gift what where did it
go he had a really cool environment
graphic I hope he's uh still doing it
graphic I hope he's uh still doing it
why' you delete the graphic man I wanted
why' you delete the graphic man I wanted
to show it off it looks
awesome this is the Moa and it's latest
awesome this is the Moa and it's latest
form we'll work on that in a bit but
form we'll work on that in a bit but
let's look at GPU
drive it's not looking
great I think I'm GNA have to start
great I think I'm GNA have to start
looking through
looking through
for silly potential error so what we'll
for silly potential error so what we'll
do
do
is let me get
okay go back to our local
here and GPU Drive
what we're going to do is we are going
what we're going to do is we are going
to
to
grab from
grab from
puffer and grab our Fork of
it I really don't know if I should have
it I really don't know if I should have
made puffer tank a separate repo cuz
made puffer tank a separate repo cuz
like people don't know it
like people don't know it
exists I've been tempted to just merge
exists I've been tempted to just merge
it all into puffer uh puffer Li but like
we'll
see I guess it's nice that you can just
see I guess it's nice that you can just
clone it on its own because it's like a
clone it on its own because it's like a
machine setup
thing yeah I think I leave it as is I
thing yeah I think I leave it as is I
think I did it
think I did it
right so what I'm looking for here is
right so what I'm looking for here is
the this right here this setup
just paste this
in see how that does
well I don't know if you saw this Nathan
well I don't know if you saw this Nathan
but it popped up the other day that
but it popped up the other day that
um dopus after like 15 years they're
um dopus after like 15 years they're
actually adding like a new big Unity
actually adding like a new big Unity
client so timing wise having an end like
client so timing wise having an end like
that in RL is probably a pretty cool
that in RL is probably a pretty cool
idea you'll probably get some people
idea you'll probably get some people
looking at
it uh what happened
here oh I have to just type this
here oh I have to just type this
manually don't I
wait subm
module the heck
I want to pull up the local render
I want to pull up the local render
basically now to see what the heck is
basically now to see what the heck is
happening with these cars
yeah I thought in beta mhm
I did realize there's going to be one
I did realize there's going to be one
mildly difficult thing um
mildly difficult thing um
so turn-based Ms are slightly ever so
so turn-based Ms are slightly ever so
slightly annoying in reinforcement
slightly annoying in reinforcement
learning just
learning just
slightly uh and the reason for that is
slightly uh and the reason for that is
that like you don't get all of the
that like you don't get all of the
observations and can't make all the
observations and can't make all the
actions for every
actions for every
agent at every time step so you have to
agent at every time step so you have to
do masking and
do masking and
stuff which is what I'm doing right here
stuff which is what I'm doing right here
for GPU drive so it's basically the same
for GPU drive so it's basically the same
thing as having a variable number of
thing as having a variable number of
Agents it is slightly inefficient I
Agents it is slightly inefficient I
think we'll still be able to make it
think we'll still be able to make it
super fast uh but I don't know you know
super fast uh but I don't know you know
we'll see how big the environment ends
we'll see how big the environment ends
up being I might even use this as an
up being I might even use this as an
excuse to like really make turn-based M
excuse to like really make turn-based M
super good and Puffer
what is happening with this
oh yeah I was thinking about it don't
oh yeah I was thinking about it don't
worry puffer will make it
work you don't need a no action
action don't suffer use
puffer hey Will what's
puffer hey Will what's
up and auto publish
up and auto publish
them oh it's so funny that Claude wasn't
them oh it's so funny that Claude wasn't
able to figure that one out well here
able to figure that one out well here
I'll show
you same thing for neural MMO right
oops not
oops not
Carper uh
puffer Pap I get
puffer Pap I get
habo
habo
docks bunch of stuff you can see that
docks bunch of stuff you can see that
there's a
there's a
make we use
Sphinx and there's some build stuff in
Sphinx and there's some build stuff in
here there is is uh a view for local but
here there is is uh a view for local but
then really The Source here there's just
then really The Source here there's just
a
a
config that sets some stuff
config that sets some stuff
up there's an index that tells you the

rst which doesn't render amazing on the
GitHub
GitHub
ironically and then all the different
ironically and then all the different
files
files
whoops are in here so like the landing
whoops are in here so like the landing
page is an

rst you just have banners whatever you
rst you just have banners whatever you
want in here
want in here
how do you prefer to structure your
how do you prefer to structure your
docks the way that I have them in here
docks the way that I have them in here
right
um I have like One landing page that has
um I have like One landing page that has
a bunch of stuff this is like a tutorial
a bunch of stuff this is like a tutorial
on everything and then I have detailed
on everything and then I have detailed
API over
API over
here
here
which technically yeah this stuff is
here do recursive autod do yeah um you
here do recursive autod do yeah um you
can do that for larger projects I found
can do that for larger projects I found
it to be kind of useless to do that
it to be kind of useless to do that
because
because
like I mean like I honestly think you've
like I mean like I honestly think you've
got a problem if you're like looking for
got a problem if you're like looking for
API
API
signatures um on like just the dock page
signatures um on like just the dock page
for internal stuff versus just reading
for internal stuff versus just reading
the source code
the source code
so what I do is I just have in the API
so what I do is I just have in the API
rst
I have specific classes this is like
I have specific classes this is like
public
API and then you can see where is
API and then you can see where is
it where's
ocean yeah like specific classes and
ocean yeah like specific classes and
stuff are autod doed like this but I
stuff are autod doed like this but I
only expose like user level stuff to
only expose like user level stuff to
this right if you want to know how like
this right if you want to know how like
some internal thing in puffer works you
some internal thing in puffer works you
open the source because like what's the
open the source because like what's the
point of just having a function header
point of just having a function header
on an internal thing
online
online
likely the more docks your project needs
likely the more docks your project needs
the worse your project
is how it goes
you want your docks to scale sublinearly
you want your docks to scale sublinearly
with project
with project
size what about the build
size what about the build
proc brother what do you need build proc
proc brother what do you need build proc
for bash make Dosh and commit and then
for bash make Dosh and commit and then
it gets hosted on GitHub
pages
so no not every time I push to Puffer
so no not every time I push to Puffer
what are you nuts you have a stable 1.0
what are you nuts you have a stable 1.0
and then you have a Dev Branch you don't
and then you have a Dev Branch you don't
just rolling release
just rolling release
everything right you have a stable 10 or
everything right you have a stable 10 or
like a stable whatever your version is
like a stable whatever your version is
and then when you do a new release you
and then when you do a new release you
update docs and
update docs and
stuff because probably like your
stuff because probably like your
releases are probably going to be large
releases are probably going to be large
enough that you got to update like the
enough that you got to update like the
landing page tutorials and stuff
landing page tutorials and stuff
anyways and then you know in settings
anyways and then you know in settings
there will be default branch and then
there will be default branch and then
pages in that you set up I'm sure you've
pages in that you set up I'm sure you've
done this right I like deploying from SL
done this right I like deploying from SL
dos I like this set up that's easy to
dos I like this set up that's easy to
mess up but like it won't detect it
mess up but like it won't detect it
correctly if you don't set this up every
correctly if you don't set this up every
some every so often you'll have to like
some every so often you'll have to like
push an empty commit as well to
push an empty commit as well to
refresh do you have docs build every
refresh do you have docs build every
time you tag a new version but probably
time you tag a new version but probably
not no I dude I don't even do CI like I
not no I dude I don't even do CI like I
hate I hate all these automated
hate I hate all these automated
obnoxious things where it's not just me
obnoxious things where it's not just me
running the
code everything is manual but everything
code everything is manual but everything
is
easy that's generally how I like to do
easy that's generally how I like to do
things
back to documenting my n

ches good
ches good
luck hey Kung two
PRS okay let's go look at those real
PRS okay let's go look at those real
quick we still got GPU Drive experiments
quick we still got GPU Drive experiments
running anyways right
yep I'm assuming this is the bug
yep I'm assuming this is the bug
piix puffer maoko
awesome zooming here
what did you port this
to what
huh it's not perform
huh it's not perform
okay I'll just take your word on this
okay I'll just take your word on this
I'm a bit confused but
I'm a bit confused but
okay what do I
care fair enough that ve noise package
care fair enough that ve noise package
was annoying
rip okay and
rip okay and
then this is what I was looking forward
to ran a carb sweep and puffer but when
to ran a carb sweep and puffer but when
I copy the hyper parameters it performs
I copy the hyper parameters it performs
worse than in the
sweep I got somebody reporting that as
sweep I got somebody reporting that as
well on the Discord
for what environment can I
ask build the
wheel
wheel
okay we'll do a little bit of
okay we'll do a little bit of
housekeeping right
now for
God the repo hygiene is so bad I got to
God the repo hygiene is so bad I got to
really it's
really it's
okay onward and
upward if you use carbs is it gives you
upward if you use carbs is it gives you
repeated
repeated
samples I I want to know what M Peter
samples I I want to know what M Peter
used that
used that
was cuz that's a different problem right
CH so Peter's saying and I had a
CH so Peter's saying and I had a
different report of this in the Discord
different report of this in the Discord
earlier
earlier
today that um some environments were not
today that um some environments were not
producing using the same train curves as
producing using the same train curves as
um The Sweep parameters
um The Sweep parameters
suggest I use breakout because I wanted
suggest I use breakout because I wanted
to test
carbs breakout should definitely
carbs breakout should definitely
work let's um can you link me the carb
work let's um can you link me the carb
sweep that you
ran because I copied the breakout pams
ran because I copied the breakout pams
and I I believe those are
and I I believe those are
good cuz I did the same thing
I could see that happening for like
I could see that happening for like
Space Invaders or something there are a
Space Invaders or something there are a
few environments that are really
few environments that are really
finicky um breakout should work unless I
finicky um breakout should work unless I
introduced a bug I did didn't I merge
introduced a bug I did didn't I merge
like a PR from that guy recently didn't
like a PR from that guy recently didn't
I merge
I merge
something wait I thought I merged
something wait I thought I merged
something to do with spaces or
something we'll have to check
that we'll do all this right now live
that we'll do all this right now live
including GPU Drive

oh my God I literally don't remember the
oh my God I literally don't remember the
freaking build
command s dist and B dist

both you didn't bump the version though
both you didn't bump the version though
I have to bump the version Don't
I have to bump the version Don't
I or did you already do that
you already did it for me very
nice more attention to detail than I
nice more attention to detail than I
would have
uh
where is this stupid thing
I'm trying to remember where I have my
credentials the heck
oh wait do I not I probably don't have
oh wait do I not I probably don't have
it on this machine
it on this machine
huh I got to go
grab they did all this tofa [ __ ] a
grab they did all this tofa [ __ ] a

ago
for for
there
what binary
wheel are Kong are we sure that we do
wheel are Kong are we sure that we do
the
the
um I don't think that we're doing
um I don't think that we're doing
the the wheel since we added the scon
stuff I got the tar G I got the tar

gzip I got the the tar file
gzip I got the the tar file
uploaded you can let me know on that um
uploaded you can let me know on that um
I'm pretty darn sure that the scon stuff
I'm pretty darn sure that the scon stuff
messes with things and makes it hard
okay so that's fixed now what was the
okay so that's fixed now what was the
other
thing Joko oh yeah that's the one I
thing Joko oh yeah that's the one I
asked you for I'm quite excited for that
actually PRS
majoko
binding merge to Dev 500
lines wait why
lines wait why
does why' you take Wan B entity
out oh
okay that's
okay that's
fine you put a default you
put oh you just put like a full clean RL
put oh you just put like a full clean RL
script in for the hell of
it does it not work with clean puff
RL or is this just like to test works
RL or is this just like to test works
both all right that's fine
both all right that's fine
[Music]
maoko okay I'm going to warn
maoko okay I'm going to warn
you I'm going to warn you that these are
you I'm going to warn you that these are
trash all right I took these out of
trash all right I took these out of
Atari recently and I got a huge
Atari recently and I got a huge
performance boost so if if you can get
performance boost so if if you can get
around to it at some point if you're
around to it at some point if you're
still doing stuff with majoko I would
still doing stuff with majoko I would
highly suggest figuring out ways to get
highly suggest figuring out ways to get
rid of this like these trash
rid of this like these trash
rappers they're real
bad cool
being
being
conservative puffer's new to the
conservative puffer's new to the
game yeah we're not conservative at all
game yeah we're not conservative at all
with the way we're deving
stuff we move fast and break things and
stuff we move fast and break things and
then we fix them live on stream when we
then we fix them live on stream when we
screw up
what do you mean it doesn't support
separate
oh yeah kind
oh yeah kind
of I mean you can put
in to be be honest I don't think it
in to be be honest I don't think it
makes a
makes a
difference I don't think it makes a
difference
difference
cool
postprocess you do with puffer post
postprocess you do with puffer post
process oh you actually made the
okay I see
solid PR
solid PR
K very
K very
solid and you know what I'm going to
solid and you know what I'm going to
do I should probably not show these so
do I should probably not show these so
I'll go over to here and I'm going to
have we gotten any replies by the way on
have we gotten any replies by the way on
the competition
reviews didn't think we had did we
two replies of them not doing
two replies of them not doing
anything Academia is such a joke
okay carbs is pretty good getting better
okay carbs is pretty good getting better
results
yeah the DNB track like they really
yeah the DNB track like they really
screwed us on that like that was
insane check
figures
ooh yeah I see
wait did you give me the
initial yeah it didn't make longer and
initial yeah it didn't make longer and
longer experiments but now it
does oh this
I don't it doesn't do this for me this
I don't it doesn't do this for me this
is
is
weird though this could be batch
weird though this could be batch
size that's
size that's
weird okay but I will look at this let
weird okay but I will look at this let
me look at this PR because this is
me look at this PR because this is
probably a big thing
probably a big thing
right if carbs is going to be even
right if carbs is going to be even
better after we merge this that's
crazy where's the
crazy where's the
a that's a PR for carbs not
really
where oh
wait in my work we run a seating
wait in my work we run a seating
function
oh mask out
wait can you explain what is go this is
wait can you explain what is go this is
really big actually
really big actually
um It's actually kind of crazy because I
um It's actually kind of crazy because I
got such ridiculously good results
got such ridiculously good results
before this like are we just going to
before this like are we just going to
solve all of
solve all of
RL if this is I mean if that's as big as
RL if this is I mean if that's as big as
a thing as you said like we go rerun 500
a thing as you said like we go rerun 500
experiment uh sweeps on Atari and just
experiment uh sweeps on Atari and just
solve everything
yeah you assume I'm not actually brain
yeah you assume I'm not actually brain
dead though
dead though
Kung uh let me
see observed so
wait remove the samples that are in
wait remove the samples that are in
success and failure observations what
seeding in other places can lead to
seeding in other places can lead to
repeated examples so we need to remove
repeated examples so we need to remove
them
[Music]
[Music]
here Jesus
why I see what this does but do you know
why I see what this does but do you know
why this happens
why this happens
like we set different RNG and it messes
like we set different RNG and it messes
up there like how would it make them
up there like how would it make them
give me repeated
give me repeated
samples I'm
confused go
back no I get the reproduction I I
back no I get the reproduction I I
believe it I'm just asking do you like
believe it I'm just asking do you like
do you know why this
happens like
happens like
why okay we seed which affects their
why okay we seed which affects their
seeding but then why does that give us
seeding but then why does that give us
repeated results
like is this a fix or a Band-Aid
patch repeated
patch repeated
samples and then and carbs initially
samples and then and carbs initially
produces random wait
produces random wait
repeated
samples carbs also samples from the
Pito seeding messes up the
sampling
how I like I I get what you're I
how I like I I get what you're I
understand the the thing that you've
understand the the thing that you've
shown here I don't understand how that
shown here I don't understand how that
happens
right
right
so because usually right
it happened before and it's not I mean
it happened before and it's not I mean
fair
enough I'll tell you what I'll do k
enough I'll tell you what I'll do k
um how
about do you want to run this on box
about do you want to run this on box
zero real quick like run breakout on
zero real quick like run breakout on
like run five like run 500 Breakout
like run five like run 500 Breakout
experiments or something on box
zero and see if we do better there as
zero and see if we do better there as
well I just want to make sure that
well I just want to make sure that
there's that we actually have like
there's that we actually have like
because this is a big this will affect
because this is a big this will affect
every single experiment in
every single experiment in
puffer and I want to make sure that this
puffer and I want to make sure that this
actually is a proper
fix and if it works there what you can
fix and if it works there what you can
do is you can PR this to the puffer fork
do is you can PR this to the puffer fork
in case MB just doesn't do it for a
in case MB just doesn't do it for a
while and then we'll sync that up when
while and then we'll sync that up when
they eventually do it um but you can
they eventually do it um but you can
grab box zero and run Breakout by
grab box zero and run Breakout by
yeah any update on carbs in w
yeah any update on carbs in w
b yeah
b yeah
I Noah something really weird happened
I Noah something really weird happened
with that
with that
so uh I had like three or four guys on
so uh I had like three or four guys on
their team including their CEO messaged
their team including their CEO messaged
me to like set up meetings and stuff
me to like set up meetings and stuff
about it
about it
and then like I had another one of the
and then like I had another one of the
guys I like I was like hey whatever
guys I like I was like hey whatever
happened to these like you guys never
happened to these like you guys never
got back to me and he said oh the team
got back to me and he said oh the team
said that you ghosted them on two
said that you ghosted them on two
meetings which like we never set up a
meetings which like we never set up a
meeting cuz they never
replied and then I sent them I sent them
replied and then I sent them I sent them
like a nice I sent them a nice write up
like a nice I sent them a nice write up
on like well okay if you guys can't like
on like well okay if you guys can't like
I don't know what's wrong but here's a
I don't know what's wrong but here's a
write up on what you guys should do and
write up on what you guys should do and
as far as I've seen they just have not
as far as I've seen they just have not
done it
done it
so I don't know
man got got to go see you
K all right what's uh we should have
K all right what's uh we should have
lots of experiments in GPU Drive done by
lots of experiments in GPU Drive done by
now
right where is this
yeah so
yeah so
definitely we have uh issues here with
definitely we have uh issues here with
GPU drive so we're going to get the
GPU drive so we're going to get the
rendering working
oops wrong
tab yeah this should
tab yeah this should
be nice and
easy
okay let's go back to what we were doing
okay let's go back to what we were doing
here before with GPU
here before with GPU
drive so we
drive so we
did make dhj
we already have it compiled to C++ 11
we already have it compiled to C++ 11
very
nice y
the funny thing with them not doing the
the funny thing with them not doing the
um not giving a native integration with
um not giving a native integration with
cars is it just makes puffer even more
cars is it just makes puffer even more
valuable but like honestly I'd rather
valuable but like honestly I'd rather
have puffer be less valuable and not
have puffer be less valuable and not
have to maintain the extra 150 lines of
have to maintain the extra 150 lines of
code in the demo file I'd rather just be
code in the demo file I'd rather just be
available everywhere so that I don't
available everywhere so that I don't
have to maintain 150 lines of extra demo
have to maintain 150 lines of extra demo
code
code
[Music]
okay not compiled with Cuda support fair
okay not compiled with Cuda support fair
enough
what's going on
what's going on
here I just take
here I just take
forever oh yeah yeah we don't want to
forever oh yeah yeah we don't want to
run that oops Yeah we don't want to run
that one world
whoa what is this
I send uh their
I send uh their
lab some
lab some
stuff I don't see
stuff I don't see
cars where are all the
cars where are the cars
right massive road yeah I know something
right massive road yeah I know something
weird that's what I figured that we'd
weird that's what I figured that we'd
just be able to like look at it and
just be able to like look at it and
figure out what's weird with it cuz I
figure out what's weird with it cuz I
see a big road and I don't see cars
so hopefully the uh the GPU Drive folks
so hopefully the uh the GPU Drive folks
will let me know that I'm nuts
here and I uh hopefully I'm hoping that
here and I uh hopefully I'm hoping that
I'll be done on this by like in the next
I'll be done on this by like in the next
hour or so because I really need to edit
hour or so because I really need to edit
this video I'm going to be real mad if I
this video I'm going to be real mad if I
have to spend my Sunday editing this
have to spend my Sunday editing this
darn video to get it out on Monday
oops somebody asked for stream link
Okay so
we have
actions so what happens when we do
this well it's not going to rerender the
this well it's not going to rerender the
frame
apparently okay we have some random data
apparently okay we have some random data
right
we have some other random
data oh I see all the cars now
data oh I see all the cars now
right you can see all the
cars maybe it's just never resetting
yeah this has got to be it that it just
yeah this has got to be it that it just
isn't resetting right
let's take a
let's take a
look like if I just run
this okay they're cars
right and now the cars are all gone and
right and now the cars are all gone and
it doesn't reset
okay the

star
star

it's funny they did that
can I look for like
can I look for like
done worlds or
something terminals nand num

some
some

around and they stop
we not have

okay so terminal is

wait
what uh I am very very
confused oh because I put this break
confused oh because I put this break
point to high
point to high
up yeah yeah yeah I put this too high
up okay I see what's
wrong for
okay we have
terminal then we have the control agent
mask terminal so now we actually get to

try this Terminal
try this Terminal
Man viam

see logic bug
I think this is if
Len let's try this
Len let's try this
guys always always render your
guys always always render your
environment if you're debugging your

environment and you haven't rendered it
environment and you haven't rendered it
you're screwing up if you're spending
you're screwing up if you're spending
time debugging your en and you haven't
time debugging your en and you haven't
bothered rendering it you're messing up
bad look at that we have
bad look at that we have
cars we have
cars we have
cars folks we have achieved liftoff
we've achieved liftoff from
stupid we have achieved liftoff and
stupid whoa whoa whoa whoa
stupid whoa whoa whoa whoa
uh
huh oh right for
okay and now we can
pull
P hatch
and we
and we
have want
have want
B
weeps
carbs okay so this is our carb site from
carbs okay so this is our carb site from
before
before
we can see it was actually getting a
we can see it was actually getting a
little better over time which is funny
little better over time which is funny
because it has very little data to do
because it has very little data to do
that with kind of
that with kind of
impressive and uh now
we literally have one data point
right oh
jeez our poor compute through putut
we're going to have to do a little more
we're going to have to do a little more
work on this because there's something
wrong for sure there's still something
wrong h
all right I'm going to be right back
all right I'm going to be right back
I'll let this run for a bit it's a
I'll let this run for a bit it's a
restroom I'll be right back and we'll go
restroom I'll be right back and we'll go
from there it's only
three
e
e e
why is my camera so freaking framy is
why is my camera so freaking framy is
what I want to
know have I just like destroyed my CPU
know have I just like destroyed my CPU
rendering
rendering
videos should just be GPU encoding
videos should just be GPU encoding
anyways I don't know what's wrong
H interesting
so what's wrong with the um the speed
so what's wrong with the um the speed
here
oh
dope guys let's just uh let's let's just
dope guys let's just uh let's let's just
ignore this one okay
uh let's just let's just ignore uh
let's rename it to GPU
drive all right and let's
drive all right and let's
just let's just kill this and let's just
just let's just kill this and let's just
uh pretend that didn't happen all right
so much better
so much better
right there we
go I thought for a second I'd like
go I thought for a second I'd like
totally messed up and uh the speed was
totally messed up and uh the speed was
just going to be
just going to be
terrible but nope I forgot the debug
terrible but nope I forgot the debug
flag
is this yeah this public
good I think we just hang out for a few
good I think we just hang out for a few
minutes and wait for this to solve
minutes and wait for this to solve
everything and see if we have any bugs
left we do have a few folks on on
left we do have a few folks on on
YouTube and twitch
cool we're going to give this a few
cool we're going to give this a few
minutes to just do some stuff
though
e e
all
all
right is this
thing oh yeah there we
thing oh yeah there we
go so
go so
uh the question is whether this is
uh the question is whether this is
actually going to learn properly
numb finished
agents this should be changing over time
okay no actually this is fine the way I
okay no actually this is fine the way I
have num finished agents it should be
oscillatory V
oscillatory V

Offroad finished agents goal
Offroad finished agents goal
achieved hard to
achieved hard to
say it's hard to say
definitely this is going to need more
definitely this is going to need more
plots can see that there are two more
plots can see that there are two more
here
already it's possible that these are
already it's possible that these are
just crazy hyper parameters
okay this m.n num worlds thing is not
okay this m.n num worlds thing is not
going to factor in because we're
cashing is this better than before
well it's definitely
well it's definitely
now doing something at
least what are our
least what are our
um what are our settings here
batch size is
260k and it varies from
260k and it varies from
302k to
500k I should get rid of this because
500k I should get rid of this because
this is not going to be
sweepable batch
size these are all the pams we would
size these are all the pams we would
want
okay let me think what else this could
be
be
so it resets
correctly are we passing rewards and
correctly are we passing rewards and
stuff let's
stuff let's
see let's just spot check a little
bit OBS and
mask this function is not used we don't
mask this function is not used we don't
need this right
episode mean reward per episode is being
logged live agent mask on reset
live agent
live agent
mask does get
reset so you get the OBS of the agents
reset so you get the OBS of the agents
you're controlling hold on
ah
confusing this is why
confusing this is why
Vari variable numbers of Agents is just
Vari variable numbers of Agents is just
evil in reinforcement learning it really
evil in reinforcement learning it really
is just
evil it makes you do so much additional
evil it makes you do so much additional
indexing and stuff it's very error prone
indexing and stuff it's very error prone
not to mention it's very inefficient
not to mention it's very inefficient
because each of these indices each of
because each of these indices each of
these index operations requires copying
these index operations requires copying
all the
all the
data so we have controlled agent
data so we have controlled agent
mask so we get a buffer containing all
mask so we get a buffer containing all
the agents we
the agents we
control and then we do a mask hold on
control and then we do a mask hold on
how's the mask
how's the mask
work how's mask work you can't be using
work how's mask work you can't be using
this then right mask
agents
for for
we're going to have to go look at this
we're going to have to go look at this
as well I think unless this is magically
learned it's getting better but it's not
learned it's getting better but it's not
getting better fast enough for my
liking for
right I forget you can't train this
right I forget you can't train this
thing locally it's too
big so we have to let the sweep run for
big so we have to let the sweep run for
a little bit I think but I can at least
I can at least do like 16 worlds or
I can at least do like 16 worlds or
whatever
right
yeah
mask so on the first step mask is all
true now it has some falses in it
indices this looks good to me it really
indices this looks good to me it really
looks good to me here
so let's look for some different markers
then I mean I would be very surprised if
then I mean I would be very surprised if
this feature were broken i' this been
this feature were broken i' this been
very heavily
very heavily
tested so
tested so
like what else can we look
like what else can we look
for control density should be one data
for control density should be one data
density okay we have oscillatory data
density okay we have oscillatory data
density
got
got
[Music]
losses nothing crazy
very good train through
very good train through
put eval
put eval
[Music]
train en is still
slow huh
I'm not seeing any
um any like bad
markers what about
performance you know these performance
performance you know these performance
markers look fine to me
[Music]
[Music]
off-road goal
achieved I might have to do some back of
achieved I might have to do some back of
the envelope math
here because bat size is huge
here because bat size is huge
right okay so here's what we're going to
right okay so here's what we're going to
do so I have 512 environments times 64
do so I have 512 environments times 64
agents I have
agents I have
32,000 agents man
and 32,000
agents am I doing this right wait is
agents am I doing this right wait is
this even
async yeah it's not even async right
async yeah it's not even async right
right because we can't do multiple
right because we can't do multiple
copies of the
copies of the
environment if we just made this thing
environment if we just made this thing
async we'd be set wouldn't
we yeah we should just be
we yeah we should just be
set I wonder if the Madrona API has that
I mean even if you have 512k batch
right you should still be able to learn
right you should still be able to learn
something though
right basically what I'm looking at here
right basically what I'm looking at here
is we have these massive massive batch
is we have these massive massive batch
sizes uh which are good for performance
sizes uh which are good for performance
but then
but then
there can be
issues like because the effective
issues like because the effective
Horizon is only a few
Horizon is only a few
steps they didn't even have an lstm to
steps they didn't even have an lstm to
begin with though and it still
worked we doing
worked we doing
here yeah now it's not even getting
here yeah now it's not even getting
[Music]
better I could just leave this but I'm
better I could just leave this but I'm
not confident that it'll actually
not confident that it'll actually
accomplish anything if I do
where the heck is train. bat size in
where the heck is train. bat size in
here why do I not see
that what
uh this doesn't show
train
gamma the hell
what the hell where's my freaking batch
what the hell where's my freaking batch
size parameter
why is this not
showing I genuinely can't
tell I guess it's
tell I guess it's
not batch size dependent is
it so weird
these are
reasonable it's not doing
well something's definitely wrong
well something's definitely wrong
something is definitely
wrong do I just take their default hyper
wrong do I just take their default hyper
parameters and try
them it didn't look like anything crazy
them it didn't look like anything crazy
special
we'll just do
what about num
steps a mini
batches
five learning rate
3 e minus
entropy no entropy that's very
interesting Max grad Norm 0.5 we'll
say what do they do do for batch
say what do they do do for batch
size 50
worlds I'm sure it's
tiny we'll do like this
maybe we'll see what this even does
nothing meaningful
there I'm going to just make sure that
there I'm going to just make sure that
we're not seeing anything good here
yeah I'm not satisfied with this the
yeah I'm not satisfied with this the
fact that they say it's such an easy
task definitely not satisfied with this
task definitely not satisfied with this
so
so
we'll stop this
sweep okay and then what we'll
sweep okay and then what we'll
do we'll do mode
cracker run on
this quite slow
and we'll see what this curve looks
like and interestingly this goes down
like and interestingly this goes down
over
training and now starts to go back
up nope
now it goes back
up hold
on there's definitely some instability
on there's definitely some instability
of some type Happening Here
what happens if I'm just scaling the
what happens if I'm just scaling the
reward
reward
wrong How likely do I think that is
I mean they're still colliding and stuff
I mean they're still colliding and stuff
so I don't think
so I don't think
[Music]
[Music]
so reward curves are definitely
suspicious
suspicious
mhm like look what happened to
this can you see the sweet page
this can you see the sweet page
here welcome back
here welcome back
K let me
see no
see no
workspace unless I'm invited to
workspace unless I'm invited to
this oops
cool
yep on box zero very nice did you
yep on box zero very nice did you
remember to set it to run 500
remember to set it to run 500
experiments instead of 100 if you just
experiments instead of 100 if you just
see like the number of experiments you
see like the number of experiments you
should see like a 100 or 500 or whatever
got to
got to
check mhm
yeah so this should be done
let me try I'm going to try another
let me try I'm going to try another
experiment while
I oops oh this was the right experiment
okay so that should have worked
right seems 500
right seems 500
sounds
good the heck is wrong with
this I
this I
mean do we know the episode length we
mean do we know the episode length we
don't right
Let's
Let's
do let's do a couple
things what do we think about this
things what do we think about this
um max font
um max font
agents um
Worlds world is the only one
Worlds world is the only one
specified he unique
specified he unique
scenes SC
config right
[Music]
[Music]
then I guess we just
then I guess we just
add episode length
they had a Max episode length somewhere
they had a Max episode length somewhere
in a rapper I remember maybe we're not
in a rapper I remember maybe we're not
doing that
first step
in interesting
92 goal
achieved then the reward function
maybe we're not returning stuff
maybe we're not returning stuff
correctly
right yeah all these self
buffers probably something like this
buffers probably something like this
right
observations truncations rewards
observations truncations rewards
right so all you do is you end up
right so all you do is you end up
setting
stuff I bet you this is the
issue yeah this has got to be it right
right
here I bet you this is
wrong for
very sparse on the reward side it is
very sparse on the reward side it is
getting it though which leads me to
getting it though which leads me to
wonder
how
because you return the reward here from
because you return the reward here from
the environment right
wrong carbs
wrong carbs
Branch
Branch
rip no big
deal I'm a little suspicious of
this for
cannot see the sweet page until you
cannot see the sweet page until you
click
click
it wait
really is that a
thing okay
thing okay
that's kind of
funny shape
M's underscore assign
M's underscore assign
buffers
right and this gets
right and this gets
called wait it gets wrapped in a
cereal I'm very confused okay
and then this gets us this gets
called m. buff
equal all
right oh I'm dumb we don't go through
right oh I'm dumb we don't go through
this
where is this
check
check
ends
exceeds back
exceeds back
end
native upper L Vector NATO
okay so you are returning
okay so you are returning
here we are actually doing this
here we are actually doing this
correctly
believe we don't need this
okay so I pre-allocated
yeah so I do this yeah
live agent Mass
let's try something real
quick what
quick what
[Music]
happens could be an off by one right
oh hey guys it's the
oh hey guys it's the
masking it's the freaking masking being
masking it's the freaking masking being
dum
I actually found
that what if I do it this
way we're going to write this in as a
way we're going to write this in as a
uh a solid find
some
bugs we do a little exorcism
bugs we do a little exorcism
we a little bit of
we a little bit of
exorcism
a and we'll go back up to 512 world so
a and we'll go back up to 512 world so
this isn't stupid
slow let me make sure this actually
trains looks like
it oh
it oh
yeah oh yeah
and let me make sure that this makes
and let me make sure that this makes
sense the thing that I just did I should
sense the thing that I just did I should
probably explain the bug because this is
probably explain the bug because this is
the common
the common
gotcha
so yeah I'll just explain it
so yeah I'll just explain it
um
um
when you have an
when you have an
environment where there are variable
environment where there are variable
number of
number of
Agents you have to mask the dead agents
Agents you have to mask the dead agents
out of the observation right cuz you
out of the observation right cuz you
want to train on dead agents that's
want to train on dead agents that's
training on padding that's bad and the
training on padding that's bad and the
way that you know when an agent dies is
way that you know when an agent dies is
that you get a done signal it says done
that you get a done signal it says done
equals true but for a lot of
equals true but for a lot of
environments right you need the reward
environments right you need the reward
on the step that it dies because it
on the step that it dies because it
could be like reward is 0000 Z and then
could be like reward is 0000 Z and then
it can be removed from the environment
it can be removed from the environment
like with reward one if it gets a goal
like with reward one if it gets a goal
and negative one if it hits a wall for
and negative one if it hits a wall for
instance
instance
right um but you can't Ma you can't set
right um but you can't Ma you can't set
the mask to be true there so what you
the mask to be true there so what you
have to do is you return the current
have to do is you return the current
mask and then you update it if you
mask and then you update it if you
update the mask and then return it then
update the mask and then return it then
your masking out the last observation
your masking out the last observation
which you can't do basically your mask
which you can't do basically your mask
has to Trail one step
behind uh why did the goal go back
down the goal just go back down while I
down the goal just go back down while I
was talking
really that could be hyper prms though
crap now I have to figure
crap now I have to figure
out what I
out what I
did hold
on we're very close to solving this
so live then set terminal then s right
live this was how it was before
live this was how it was before
right so you can't do it this
way mask is live agent mask
uh my brain hurts hold on
side by side
this live agent
this live agent
mask of terminals equal to zero
looks right to
me this really not
work e
it's definitely something with
this I'm finished agents
okay this really not
work hold on
First
First
Step mask
is live agent mask is one right so first
is live agent mask is one right so first
step it's all
step it's all
one then you set the terms to
zero why is it this order
oh because of the
shapes so yeah this looks
shapes so yeah this looks
correct oh look it does
correct oh look it does
work
work
right yeah it's just
fincky that's fine
fincky that's fine
mask live agent mask
terminal
perfect five po of
perfect five po of
environments goal achieved um being
environments goal achieved um being
slightly over one is a bit
slightly over one is a bit
weird I'm sure that there's something
weird I'm sure that there's something
with that
maybe I should find that real
quick we'll see if there's uh a little
quick we'll see if there's uh a little
masking that has to be done here or
masking that has to be done here or
something weird right
I think we're close to having this set
this is your info
tensor this is your controlled agent
tensor this is your controlled agent
mask
so I can just
so I can just
do I can just do this
right I can just do this can
I let's see if this prevents it from
I let's see if this prevents it from
going over
1.0 e
what
what
happened shape of mask is not I thought
happened shape of mask is not I thought
I just I thought I just tried
this I thought I just made sure that
this I thought I just made sure that
this
worked for
right let's see what the heck is wrong
right let's see what the heck is wrong
with this
keeps going
[Music]
[Music]
uh what
wait this says World 274 is
done but that doesn't make sense
164 and 5
oh
let's see if this does it I think this
works if this works then we uh I go take
works if this works then we uh I go take
a break I grab a shake I come back and
a break I grab a shake I come back and
edit video and chill for a bit
looks like it's
looks like it's
good we'll track this this will be the
good we'll track this this will be the
last one if this works we start the
last one if this works we start the
sweep and we're
good e
I can't tell if it's just finicky
oh there it
is yeah there we
go solved
is it going to go over one let's
see it's not going over one come
on well hard to say because it just
on well hard to say because it just
stopped but whatever I think we're
stopped but whatever I think we're
good we're
chilling for
what
me make sure that it actually does
me make sure that it actually does
something
oh
yeah I think that uh I am going to go
yeah I think that uh I am going to go
make myself a shake and have this
make myself a shake and have this
environment solve by the time I get back
environment solve by the time I get back
how's that sound I'll be right back few
how's that sound I'll be right back few
minutes now
e
for
e
e
e
e
for
e
for for
for
okay man my camera is crazy framy isn't
okay man my camera is crazy framy isn't
it
it
like that's
like that's
weird we're going to have to do some
weird we're going to have to do some
maintenance but not right now not right
maintenance but not right now not right
now show me some good news
okay
okay these are random hypers so it takes
okay these are random hypers so it takes
a
second yeah you can see that
here so we'll let this run for a
here so we'll let this run for a
bit um I
will I will change the stream title
will I will change the stream title
[Music]
[Music]
and I will start editing on the video a
and I will start editing on the video a
bit while this
bit while this
runs and then once it's done some
runs and then once it's done some
experiments I will later tonight I will
experiments I will later tonight I will
post
post
uh I mean probably in just an hour or
uh I mean probably in just an hour or
whatever right I'll be able to post a
whatever right I'll be able to post a
cool sweep
let's update
titles for
all right there we
all right there we
go
go
so screen
so screen
filter [ __ ]
filter [ __ ]
blur
blur
close
close
cool we'll leave this in the
cool we'll leave this in the
background and I
background and I
will open some stuff
I forget you can't
I forget you can't
open you open Adobe premere from home or
open you open Adobe premere from home or
is it screw up the
is it screw up the
fonts we'll see should
work I should probably tell them I fixed
work I should probably tell them I fixed
it
the
the
heck what was I doing
like have all sorts of stuff
misaligned there we
go
for e
where is this table
okay do I have stats on
Doom I should probably get stats on Doom
Doom I should probably get stats on Doom
right
yeah let's do that real quick
I just run it on the same
machine e
[ __ ]
what's the
default is
Doom Health Gathering sueme
oops so funny thing I
oops so funny thing I
found um is that there's actually
found um is that there's actually
a 160 by 120 resolution
option in
Doom and if you do
Doom and if you do
that everything is fast
15K frames per
second
90k
100K I think Doom's 100 K steps per
100K I think Doom's 100 K steps per
second environment folks
second environment folks
anything
anything
better looks like
not it's very easy to hit 100K though it
not it's very easy to hit 100K though it
seems like it doesn't go
over hello why does YouTube doesn't show
over hello why does YouTube doesn't show
messages sometimes uh I don't know it's
messages sometimes uh I don't know it's
I haven't done anything to YouTube I
I haven't done anything to YouTube I
think that they have like some weird
think that they have like some weird
spam filters or something like if you
spam filters or something like if you
try to type too many things too fast and
try to type too many things too fast and
I think that they try to Auto filter
I think that they try to Auto filter
links or something
links or something
dumb but if you don't see it on the chat
dumb but if you don't see it on the chat
window right here then it doesn't show
up welcome though
Doom's
100K does that include frame skip
FR
stack looks like
stack looks like
not
probably for
welcome YouTube
folks we actually did get a little bit
folks we actually did get a little bit
of code in today which is nice we will
of code in today which is nice we will
check on those experiment results in a
check on those experiment results in a
little bit later
little bit later
I'm just doing some editing in the
I'm just doing some editing in the
meantime
heck
do you think world
do you think world
models like shown in this paper hold
models like shown in this paper hold
on oh that's the original one yeah
on oh that's the original one yeah
that's David H's original one
right I have I have the blur on for this
right I have I have the blur on for this
screen
screen
uh are worth it if very fast or not the
uh are worth it if very fast or not the
Focus right now so I have a a more
Focus right now so I have a a more
complex answer to that hold
on
on
so I think that it is
so I think that it is
likely that world
likely that world
models in some form to enable a policy
models in some form to enable a policy
to quantify its
to quantify its
uncertainty about its predictions
uncertainty about its predictions
could be
could be
useful
useful
however I what the thing that I don't
however I what the thing that I don't
like about world models is attempting to
like about world models is attempting to
replace the simulator with like a
replace the simulator with like a
hallucinated version of the simulator in
hallucinated version of the simulator in
my mind that seems like a hack in order
my mind that seems like a hack in order
to try to like eek out more uh
to try to like eek out more uh
essentially eek out extra frames out of
essentially eek out extra frames out of
the
the
simulator when the simulator is really
simulator when the simulator is really
slow um and a lot of the environments
slow um and a lot of the environments
that this has been used for and said
that this has been used for and said
like Hey look it's way better with World
like Hey look it's way better with World
models than
models than
without they've been set up completely
without they've been set up completely
wrong like the dreamer paper on uh the
wrong like the dreamer paper on uh the
crafter Benchmark for instance like the
crafter Benchmark for instance like the
crafter end runs so incredibly slowly
crafter end runs so incredibly slowly
it's like unrealistically slow like
it's like unrealistically slow like
nothing should ever be that slow um so
nothing should ever be that slow um so
yeah then it makes sense to cheat out
yeah then it makes sense to cheat out
extra frames some way but I think most
extra frames some way but I think most
of the time you're probably going to
of the time you're probably going to
want World models to just
want World models to just
be there to help you quantify your
be there to help you quantify your
uncertainty not to replace interaction
uncertainty not to replace interaction
with the simulator
with the simulator
itself that's going to be one of the
itself that's going to be one of the
things that we look
things that we look
at in puffer
at in puffer
um I'd say fairly early on once we start
um I'd say fairly early on once we start
doing
doing
algorithms but you know when we actually
algorithms but you know when we actually
go to look at them we're going to be
go to look at them we're going to be
able to do proper science on it we're
able to do proper science on it we're
going to be able to have you know
going to be able to have you know
comprehensive results over night uh with
comprehensive results over night uh with
how fast our simulators are and the
how fast our simulators are and the
comparison is going to be for most
comparison is going to be for most
purposes wall clock not sample
purposes wall clock not sample
efficiency which will shift things quite
efficiency which will shift things quite
a
a
bit so that's a long answer
okay
that hack
that hack
graphic let me turn the AC hold on
I'd like to at least get um most of the
I'd like to at least get um most of the
editing done on this project
editing done on this project
today I got to get a better hardware
today I got to get a better hardware
setup though for uh for stuff you can
setup though for uh for stuff you can
see the camera is skipping now and
see the camera is skipping now and
actually while I was recording I managed
actually while I was recording I managed
it manage to have some camera lag very
it manage to have some camera lag very
seldom but I might have to re-record a
seldom but I might have to re-record a
couple small things we'll see but it's
couple small things we'll see but it's
it's kind of silly
do we have sweep results
yet yeah okay this end is
solved yeah okay yeah we solved I'll
solved yeah okay yeah we solved I'll
show those in a little
show those in a little
bit I'll show those in a little
bit that's funny
for things like self-driving
for things like self-driving
cars it's worth it because real life
cars it's worth it because real life
data is limited and slow to collect I
data is limited and slow to collect I
assume
assume
um yes
um yes
but wait until you hear my upcoming
but wait until you hear my upcoming
video I have thoughts on that and like
video I have thoughts on that and like
yes it's a reasonable thing to care
yes it's a reasonable thing to care
about but I definitely don't think that
about but I definitely don't think that
the majority of RL should be using World
the majority of RL should be using World
models like that there are good reasons
models like that there are good reasons
behind that so wait as soon as this
behind that so wait as soon as this
video is edited and posted which will
video is edited and posted which will
probably be by Monday you'll see this is
probably be by Monday you'll see this is
a much higher produced piece of content
a much higher produced piece of content
as well
the gist of it is
the gist of it is
um it makes it really hard to make any
um it makes it really hard to make any
progress in research when you start
progress in research when you start
doing stuff with World models and slow
doing stuff with World models and slow
down all the experiments so much
holy hell what is it with PE like
holy hell what is it with PE like
researchers and trying to upload
researchers and trying to upload
gigantic gifts on the
websites like stop
it CU got like a Hollywood length
it CU got like a Hollywood length
GI for
uhoh is it my is my CPU just like
uhoh is it my is my CPU just like
burning what the [ __ ] is
happening I don't know why like this
happening I don't know why like this
stuff is so stuttery
yeah it's freaking burning my CPU what
yeah it's freaking burning my CPU what
the
hell that's annoying
oh okay I
oh okay I
see for whatever reason that's weird so
see for whatever reason that's weird so
luckily my footage is not correct
luckily my footage is not correct
corupted but for whatever reason I guess
corupted but for whatever reason I guess
like the GIF encoding is really gross
like the GIF encoding is really gross
and whenever you play a whenever you
and whenever you play a whenever you
like put a gif into a video the preview
like put a gif into a video the preview
just gets all laggy and it just burns
just gets all laggy and it just burns
your CPU trying to like overlay a gift
your CPU trying to like overlay a gift
onto a
video that's weird
yeah that go it takes my CPU from 60
yeah that go it takes my CPU from 60
something Celsius with with all the
something Celsius with with all the
streaming and stuff um all the way up to
streaming and stuff um all the way up to
90 Celsius in like 5 Seconds that's
crazy that's on Max fan curve as
well
for e
I get to put GPU drive into my video
yay you got to give their lab credit
yay you got to give their lab credit
like they're one of the only groups here
like they're one of the only groups here
who did not put a stupidly gigantic GIF
who did not put a stupidly gigantic GIF
2.8 Megs is
reasonable let's go Hey Eugene I'm oh
reasonable let's go Hey Eugene I'm oh
wait I got something for you since
wait I got something for you since
you're watching hold on you'll get to be
you're watching hold on you'll get to be
the first to see this uh I got something
the first to see this uh I got something
for you let me undo the
blur GP puu Drive is
blur GP puu Drive is
solved and uh how fast do you think this
solved and uh how fast do you think this
was let's
see time relative time
see time relative time
process uh so far the best solve time is
process uh so far the best solve time is
48 seconds 48.5 seconds my bad for 9.99
48 seconds 48.5 seconds my bad for 9.99
94 score or goal achieved got to
94 score or goal achieved got to
validate these still
validate these still
but uh this is just the start of carbs
but uh this is just the start of carbs
it's like it can get
it's like it can get
faster what yeah and we can make this
faster what yeah and we can make this
even faster I assume that's minutes no
even faster I assume that's minutes no
no no no no no I told you like this is
no no no no no I told you like this is
what I'm doing with puffer stuff is fast
what I'm doing with puffer stuff is fast
stuff gets easy because you just
stuff gets easy because you just
automate
automate
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
everything we're going to be able to do
everything we're going to be able to do
this with all of GPU drive as well like
this with all of GPU drive as well like
all of your different scenes will be
all of your different scenes will be
like this the only thing that we need in
like this the only thing that we need in
order to make that happen is this is
order to make that happen is this is
that one scene yeah this is okay but let
that one scene yeah this is okay but let
me explain this is one scene just
me explain this is one scene just
because I could only find one scene with
because I could only find one scene with
60 cars in it so I could densely pack
60 cars in it so I could densely pack
the data we make a couple little changes
the data we make a couple little changes
to the way you're storing data and
to the way you're storing data and
assuming that GPU Drive actually does
assuming that GPU Drive actually does
scale linearly with the number of Agents
scale linearly with the number of Agents
right it has good parallelization
right it has good parallelization
internally uh we can do this with
internally uh we can do this with
anything so yeah now there's a
anything so yeah now there's a
possibility I've messed stuff up but I
possibility I've messed stuff up but I
don't think so um I validated this
don't think so um I validated this
pretty extensively I got to load these
pretty extensively I got to load these
up and watch them play but yeah this is
up and watch them play but yeah this is
the the scene that I linked in chat
the the scene that I linked in chat
before it does scale linearly 100% okay
before it does scale linearly 100% okay
so the issue right now and I discussed
so the issue right now and I discussed
this with Daphne earlier today is that
this with Daphne earlier today is that
uh right now you have to pad your
uh right now you have to pad your
environments to a fixed number of agents
environments to a fixed number of agents
and for whatever reason that ends up
and for whatever reason that ends up
making it really slow so if we can if we
making it really slow so if we can if we
can just get the data not padded out of
can just get the data not padded out of
GPU drive itself so like a so
GPU drive itself so like a so
environment one has one agent
environment one has one agent
environment two has five then like that
environment two has five then like that
goes into the first six elements right
goes into the first six elements right
then there's 10 that goes into the next
then there's 10 that goes into the next
10 elements if we can do that then there
10 elements if we can do that then there
shouldn't be any overhead and we should
shouldn't be any overhead and we should
be able to make this go Zoom um yeah
be able to make this go Zoom um yeah
internally they're padding free right so
internally they're padding free right so
if we can actually do that because I
if we can actually do that because I
don't know what happened with that
don't know what happened with that
padding operation but for some reason
padding operation but for some reason
it's it's really slow cuz I undo that
it's it's really slow cuz I undo that
padding operation in pu and it still
padding operation in pu and it still
ends up being slow um yeah and then we
ends up being slow um yeah and then we
can play with a couple other things to
can play with a couple other things to
increase the data density cuz I think we
increase the data density cuz I think we
could make this go even faster like
could make this go even faster like
there's no reason we can't have this
there's no reason we can't have this
training double this speed
training double this speed
even tensor that we're passing out is
even tensor that we're passing out is
padded I
see yeah it's weird it's definitely
see yeah it's weird it's definitely
weird it does seem like it scaled with
weird it does seem like it scaled with
the size of that tensor though not with
the size of that tensor though not with
the number of Agents I could be doing
the number of Agents I could be doing
something weird there though uh but
something weird there though uh but
let's take a look at the train
speed CU I have those as
speed CU I have those as
metrics it's pretty variable as well so
metrics it's pretty variable as well so
you can see that most of these runs are
you can see that most of these runs are
between 160 and this one's crazy this
between 160 and this one's crazy this
one's at like 400k steps per second but
one's at like 400k steps per second but
most of them are between like 160 and
most of them are between like 160 and
260 steps per second on a 4090
you can see all of these different
you can see all of these different
experiments that have been run this is
experiments that have been run this is
just I launched this I don't know 30
just I launched this I don't know 30
minutes ago or
something and you can see all the
something and you can see all the
different
different
parameters so my hope which is what I
parameters so my hope which is what I
want to do for the whole field is I want
want to do for the whole field is I want
to have everything be this fast so that
to have everything be this fast so that
like you have a new idea for an
like you have a new idea for an
experiment you have a new idea for an
experiment you have a new idea for an
algorithm or method you just implement
algorithm or method you just implement
it you run comprehensive experiments in
it you run comprehensive experiments in
like a couple of hours on one GPU and
like a couple of hours on one GPU and
you're set and while I have to do a lot
you're set and while I have to do a lot
of work on other simulators to make them
of work on other simulators to make them
fast enough like we just do a couple
fast enough like we just do a couple
little things on GPU drive and you'll be
little things on GPU drive and you'll be
able to have that at least for all the
able to have that at least for all the
stuff your lab wants to do with
it so yeah I got delayed for for a
it so yeah I got delayed for for a
couple weeks building this I got delayed
couple weeks building this I got delayed
on like fixing up the stuff with the
on like fixing up the stuff with the
binding for uh for puffer but now it
binding for uh for puffer but now it
works now it's super fast and uh there
works now it's super fast and uh there
were just a couple dumb bugs I had to
were just a couple dumb bugs I had to
fix and now we're good
there's a 32 second run that got 0.95 it
there's a 32 second run that got 0.95 it
looks
like oh actually we're down to 44
like oh actually we're down to 44
seconds now I'm looking at it cuz
seconds now I'm looking at it cuz
998 yeah it'll get faster
998 yeah it'll get faster
too it will get even faster because
too it will get even faster because
carbs will find better hypers
I actually got a bug report that I'm not
I actually got a bug report that I'm not
even using carbs as well as I should be
even using carbs as well as I should be
so that should be even way
better let's see has it done any better
better let's see has it done any better
since I started
talking now 44 seconds is where it
talking now 44 seconds is where it
stands it's the best one right
now we'll see how much faster it gets
this is 512 copies of the uh the biggest
this is 512 copies of the uh the biggest
environment I could find which is 60
environment I could find which is 60
agents like 32,000 agents or
something I saw a cute house on Zillow
something I saw a cute house on Zillow
and had to pop
and had to pop
out no
out no
worries no worries I just been I've just
worries no worries I just been I've just
been yapping about uh about metrics
44 seconds is the current best to solve
44 seconds is the current best to solve
it we'll get faster than that
though right there
whoops uh oh where did my experiments go
there we
go I don't quite understand the Slowdown
go I don't quite understand the Slowdown
internally each agent each Sim I'm
internally each agent each Sim I'm
assume has a variable number of Agents
assume has a variable number of Agents
so we need to chitchat with yud Brennan
so we need to chitchat with yud Brennan
yep yeah that would be good
yep yeah that would be good
also
also
um I don't know if there's a way to
um I don't know if there's a way to
unload scenes you can't unload the
unload scenes you can't unload the
entire Madrona Sim right now that's a
entire Madrona Sim right now that's a
bug in madona it crashes Cuda
bug in madona it crashes Cuda
um I definitely suggested doing uh
um I definitely suggested doing uh
running it in sub processes still
running it in sub processes still
doesn't work still crashes Cuda so I'm
doesn't work still crashes Cuda so I'm
caching the environments across
caching the environments across
experiments now so we can't actually
experiments now so we can't actually
ever like remake the environments with
ever like remake the environments with
uh for instance like one thing that I do
uh for instance like one thing that I do
with my other sweeps right is like I
with my other sweeps right is like I
could set uh the N number of Worlds as a
could set uh the N number of Worlds as a
hyper parameter or I could set like the
hyper parameter or I could set like the
number of unique scenes as a hyper
number of unique scenes as a hyper
parameter I don't think we can do that
parameter I don't think we can do that
now so there's going to have to be a
now so there's going to have to be a
little bit of I mean it's a little bit
little bit of I mean it's a little bit
of lower lower level engineering right
of lower lower level engineering right
for this
stuff they will
we need to make a fun internet ml people
we need to make a fun internet ml people
gather.
toown I think I'm terminally online
toown I think I'm terminally online
enough as
enough as
is gather Town gives me Co
is gather Town gives me Co
Vibes need a gather Town replacement
the funny thing about that to me is like
the funny thing about that to me is like
they made a gamified chat room when like
they made a gamified chat room when like
any multiplayer game is already
that rather.
that rather.
clown it's
funny wait is that an actual site
okay no I got you
baited no it's not a real site you're
baited no it's not a real site you're
messing with me
do it find anything faster while I've
do it find anything faster while I've
been shat
in
in
oh uh we're now down to 41 seconds for
oh uh we're now down to 41 seconds for
uh for solving the N down to 41 seconds
seconds I think we should aim for 30 GPU
seconds I think we should aim for 30 GPU
Drive in 30 seconds learn to drive in 30
Drive in 30 seconds learn to drive in 30

seconds that sounds good to
me I think we can do
it yeah I can't see the other message
it yeah I can't see the other message
you can DM it to
you can DM it to

me I guess i' check the vid I'm worried
you're somehow deleting all the cars
you're somehow deleting all the cars
learning to drive in 30 seconds is a
learning to drive in 30 seconds is a
great paper title I mean to be fair we
great paper title I mean to be fair we
solve pong in 90 seconds and that thing
solve pong in 90 seconds and that thing
requires pixel OBS
right we can train uh we can check the
right we can train uh we can check the
vid though I'll what I usually do is
vid though I'll what I usually do is
once I finish training these right like
once I finish training these right like
I'll pick one of the good sets of hyper
I'll pick one of the good sets of hyper
prams and I'll train that again from
prams and I'll train that again from
scratch and then I'll download that
scratch and then I'll download that
model right to make sure that it
model right to make sure that it
works and usually you end up getting
works and usually you end up getting
like a little bit lucky with these cuz
like a little bit lucky with these cuz
you know there is runto run variants um
you know there is runto run variants um
but it still ends up being pretty
close I think even if I were deleting
close I think even if I were deleting
all the cars I think the logging should
all the cars I think the logging should
still catch that we would we'd have to
still catch that we would we'd have to
see
see
I don't know I could be dumb but I
I don't know I could be dumb but I
wasn't going to post this until I
wasn't going to post this until I
checked the videos but you happen to
checked the videos but you happen to
jump in and I'm pretty sure it's good
so we've done snake in 30 seconds and
so we've done snake in 30 seconds and
stuff before but that one trains it a
stuff before but that one trains it a
million steps per
second come to think of it I think um
probably we could even do like an MMO in
probably we could even do like an MMO in
that amount of time right if I do
that amount of time right if I do

oops am I on the right

hold
on well the thing is I don't save I
on well the thing is I don't save I
don't save trained models while you do
don't save trained models while you do
when I do sweeps because if you save
when I do sweeps because if you save
models from sweeps I end up saving
models from sweeps I end up saving
hundreds of model files for every sweep
hundreds of model files for every sweep
um so I save model files on individual
um so I save model files on individual
runs not sweeps so what I do is I run
runs not sweeps so what I do is I run
the sweep I copy the hyper prams from
the sweep I copy the hyper prams from
the best the best one and then I rerun
that okay fine I the thing I can't train
that okay fine I the thing I can't train
it on the local box because it takes too
it on the local box because it takes too
much Cuda memory so I'd have to kill the
much Cuda memory so I'd have to kill the
sweep in order to train on i' have to
sweep in order to train on i' have to
like to kill the sweep in order to train
like to kill the sweep in order to train
that it's not a three line change I run
that it's not a three line change I run
out of Cuda
memory sounds like an excuse I can kill
memory sounds like an excuse I can kill
the sweep if you want you want me to
the sweep if you want you want me to
kill the sweep I can do
that but then we're not going to get 30
that but then we're not going to get 30

Kung report to me that I'm a dumbass and
Kung report to me that I'm a dumbass and
I apparently uh did made some bugs when
I apparently uh did made some bugs when
I did the carb sweep integration so
I did the carb sweep integration so
apparently should actually be way better

you lose some
you lose some
there let me see

not I'm kind of suspicious too now
not I'm kind of suspicious too now
because these are really good results

it's actually under 30 seconds let's see
it's actually under 30 seconds let's see
now I'm suspicious too because this is

senior pick well then yeah it should be
senior pick well then yeah it should be
easy to solve
right I think it's way faster than 30
right I think it's way faster than 30
seconds actually because I have it fixed

fixing uh what I will just do for now is

this no it's not that it messes with it
this no it's not that it messes with it
it's that you have to mess with with the

it looks really good so now here's the
it looks really good so now here's the
real kicker right now is when I tell you
real kicker right now is when I tell you
how fast this traes and you're not going
how fast this traes and you're not going
to believe
this so GPU drive right here's the thing
this so GPU drive right here's the thing
normally I will sweep the uh the
normally I will sweep the uh the
duration of the experiment but there are
duration of the experiment but there are
a couple Jank things that we're trying
a couple Jank things that we're trying
to fix with carbs to make it a little
to fix with carbs to make it a little
better at the moment so I turned that
better at the moment so I turned that
off for a little bit so this one this
off for a little bit so this one this
experiment trains at looks like over
experiment trains at looks like over
250k steps per second
and let me turn the smoothing
off goal achieved is capped in 3.5
off goal achieved is capped in 3.5
million and if I change this axis from
million and if I change this axis from
steps to process
time less than 30 seconds
solved I don't even know how it
solved I don't even know how it
is oh yeah cuz this at the end here this
is oh yeah cuz this at the end here this
uh yeah yeah
okay but yeah less than 30 seconds so
okay but yeah less than 30 seconds so
28.5 seconds it says
solving uh driving in 30
seconds posted that in the
slack I'll give you the figure
and you guys also can have the sweep
and you guys also can have the sweep
link as
well we could try to make it
well we could try to make it
faster we should work on picking the
faster we should work on picking the
agent if this that's yeah it that's what
agent if this that's yeah it that's what
I try to say that's what I'm saying yeah
I try to say that's what I'm saying yeah
for
for
sure it already
sure it already
is yeah but it'll be way cooler if like
is yeah but it'll be way cooler if like
I think that if you actually got it to
I think that if you actually got it to
the point where uh you can load any
the point where uh you can load any
combination of scenes like this you
combination of scenes like this you
could have one policy solve all the
could have one policy solve all the
scenes simultaneously oh uh also I this
scenes simultaneously oh uh also I this
is not the same policy that you have by
is not the same policy that you have by
default I made the policy a little
default I made the policy a little
simpler um and it still works I'll show
simpler um and it still works I'll show
you that so here let me give you the
you that so here let me give you the
link I
link I
think let me see I think that this link
think let me see I think that this link
works one agent yeah so I'll show you
works one agent yeah so I'll show you
the the policy real
the the policy real
quick I think you'll like this I did add
quick I think you'll like this I did add
an lstm to it just I don't even know if
an lstm to it just I don't even know if
you need one I just add lstms to
you need one I just add lstms to
everything by default CU you can with
everything by default CU you can with
puffer uh 90 lines so I stole your
puffer uh 90 lines so I stole your
unpack function and then I simplified I
unpack function and then I simplified I
took out all the layer norms and stuff
took out all the layer norms and stuff
so it's just uh linear reu linear for
so it's just uh linear reu linear for
ego partner and road map in beds a
ego partner and road map in beds a
project actor and a value function and
project actor and a value function and
then i s which an lstm in the
then i s which an lstm in the
middle so there's the whole
policy this
policy this
is also all available in puffer uh it's
is also all available in puffer uh it's
set up in the docker for you as well so
set up in the docker for you as well so
it has puffer all set up like this with
it has puffer all set up like this with
GPU Drive in the uh the image does it
GPU Drive in the uh the image does it
still have its permutation in variance
still have its permutation in variance
uh it should let me
see torch. cat yeah it does because we
see torch. cat yeah it does because we
do the Maxes here
right we avoided an lstm because you
right we avoided an lstm because you
know so this is how easy an lstm is in
puffer this is how easy the lstm is in
puffer this is how easy the lstm is in
puffer uh what we do
is I'll show
is I'll show
you this is one of the things that uh we
you this is one of the things that uh we
do to try to make your life a little
easier so the hard thing about getting
easier so the hard thing about getting
an lstm right is there's this really
an lstm right is there's this really
obnoxious transpose and if you mess it
obnoxious transpose and if you mess it
up like everything breaks so what you do
up like everything breaks so what you do
is you just give your policy to the lstm
is you just give your policy to the lstm
and then we do a whole bunch of asserts
and then we do a whole bunch of asserts
here to make sure you're not screwing
here to make sure you're not screwing
anything else up and we do the
anything else up and we do the
transposes and stuff for you so you do
transposes and stuff for you so you do
encode all the transposes and stuff the
encode all the transposes and stuff the
recurrent cell transposes and then
recurrent cell transposes and then
decode so I just put like everything
decode so I just put like everything
before lstm into end code everything
before lstm into end code everything
after into dcode and it works
got to figure out how to
got to figure out how to
replace all The Pedestrian viz with this
replace all The Pedestrian viz with this

would be really nice for this project
would be really nice for this project
for sure
oh I will suggest in the future by the

way uh if you want to not have students
way uh if you want to not have students
suffer as much with P game because P
suffer as much with P game because P
game is just such a pain this library is
game is just such a pain this library is
awesome for visuals like this library is
awesome for visuals like this library is
so so so much easier for graphics RB's
so so so much easier for graphics RB's
awesome and uh if you actually use their
awesome and uh if you actually use their
low-level apis you can run it on the web
low-level apis you can run it on the web
too which is kind of
too which is kind of
cool oh look they literally added snake
but uh yeah here's our
snake run it on the
web well this is the puffer snake so
web well this is the puffer snake so
here RL agents on the web uh like this
here RL agents on the web uh like this
is me playing the yellow snake versus
is me playing the yellow snake versus
all the RL agents and then I can take my
all the RL agents and then I can take my
hands off the keyboard
hands off the keyboard
right GPU drive on the web
the drona working on getting Vulcan
the drona working on getting Vulcan
batched rendering in a
batched rendering in a
bit yeah
yeah I'm trying to think
yeah I'm trying to think
like GPU Drive is probably way too
like GPU Drive is probably way too
complicated to can you like it is C++ is
complicated to can you like it is C++ is
there any chance you can compile that
there any chance you can compile that
thing for web
assembly cuz if you can compile that to
assembly cuz if you can compile that to
web assembly it's really not that hard
web assembly it's really not that hard
to throw together a web client and then
to throw together a web client and then
you can have it on the
web I might even be willing to help you
web I might even be willing to help you
out with
that the porting of the client to run on
that the porting of the client to run on
web at the very
web at the very
least not I'm not messing with compiling
least not I'm not messing with compiling
giant Blobs of C++ to web assembly but
giant Blobs of C++ to web assembly but
if you have that working and want help
if you have that working and want help
porting the um the pame renderer to run
porting the um the pame renderer to run
on web I can do that it's not that
bad this whole this like snake
bad this whole this like snake

here I think I posted this on Twitter a
here I think I posted this on Twitter a
while ago
but that whole demo is 400 383 lines of

multi GPU if it runs this fast
multi GPU if it runs this fast
right see you
around no that's good though that's my

5:25 I've only got two hours maybe two
5:25 I've only got two hours maybe two

subsist so if you have not St started
the puffer yet just
hungry then we got to go get madona hide
hungry then we got to go get madona hide

I got to tell Aaron this as well because
I got to tell Aaron this as well because
he was using
he was using
uh he was using puffer for madona hide
uh he was using puffer for madona hide

get a kick out of
that check my drone to hide and seek
Madrona escape room oh I should list
Madrona escape room oh I should list
this as another garbage environment well
this as another garbage environment well
not this one the original oh man the
not this one the original oh man the
original is probably the worst code I've
original is probably the worst code I've
ever seen in RL holy
ever seen in RL holy
hell I mean it would almost be mean to

pick on him with how like uh the
pick on him with how like uh the
original code was so so so
original code was so so so
slow and it's so funny because it's like

also hanabe like it's a card game why
also hanabe like it's a card game why
does a card game need to be on the GPU
does a card game need to be on the GPU
right GPU dri is a good use case lar lar
yeaha hide SE

what I did is I got an artist to like 3D
what I did is I got an artist to like 3D
model all of these so that they would
model all of these so that they would
get like the flat shaded low poly vibe
get like the flat shaded low poly vibe
to them um and then these are like icons
to them um and then these are like icons
that are used in the game and stuff uh I
that are used in the game and stuff uh I
kind of did the Roomscape thing where
kind of did the Roomscape thing where
they just like made the icons out of it
they just like made the icons out of it

trying to think of games
I I basically like a lot of like the

simpler stuff as long as it doesn't
simpler stuff as long as it doesn't
cross into the realm of being like

more than anything
yeah this game was so
yeah this game was so
good where's your thing I mean I showed
good where's your thing I mean I showed

[Music]
[Music]
somewhere didn't I show you with your
somewhere didn't I show you with your
artwork in it at some
point it looks really
nice obviously missing the animations
feel like you really want to lean into
feel like you really want to lean into
an isometric yeah but not for this game
an isometric yeah but not for this game
right because this game is it's a mooba
right because this game is it's a mooba
you can't really do an isometric
mooba the Moa like I realize so it
mooba the Moa like I realize so it
either has to be top down or it has to
either has to be top down or it has to
be like you're looking at a fish tank
be like you're looking at a fish tank
like those are the two things that you
like those are the two things that you
could pull off that I could
could pull off that I could
see because most mobas are top down
I mean your assets actually look pretty
I mean your assets actually look pretty
cool especially with the
cool especially with the
um they match way better than I thought
um they match way better than I thought
that they would it's given me like the
that they would it's given me like the
old arcadey vibes with the shaders and

so it's just a little bit of it right

made and I had somebody
made and I had somebody
do if you're asking if it's like
do if you're asking if it's like
one I actually don't know what you're

meaning I I I can't even
guess like there's a full 3D model of
guess like there's a full 3D model of
the puffer fish that I can open in unity
the puffer fish that I can open in unity
or
whatever let me see if I have it on this
machine it doesn't look like I have it
machine it doesn't look like I have it
on this machine unfortunately but I
on this machine unfortunately but I
could show you there's like a full 3D
could show you there's like a full 3D

lie about stuff and and things like I
don't even have to lie about stuff and
don't even have to lie about stuff and
like because I can build things it's so
like because I can build things it's so
much easier to just get their skill set
much easier to just get their skill set
than it is for them to get mine so I can

right screw it i'm G to make a company
right screw it i'm G to make a company
and I'm going to put a puffer fish on it
and it's going to be like the most legit
and it's going to be like the most legit

there for
certainly putting in leg work I hope
so I'd certainly hope so
you know there's this funny thing that I
you know there's this funny thing that I
hear a lot as
hear a lot as
well the justification I hear is like oh
well the justification I hear is like oh
well if you can't sell anything it's not

threads are so hard to find let me see
threads are so hard to find let me see
if I see
it me look at

oh your profile picture has like similar
oh your profile picture has like similar
colors to another guy look bet you see
colors to another guy look bet you see
how like bet has like similar colors so
how like bet has like similar colors so
like at a glance I thought this was
like at a glance I thought this was
someone
else okay let's make an art pack
awesome we're going to have to do
awesome we're going to have to do
something with the puffer at some point
something with the puffer at some point
I think we should also like whatever you
I think we should also like whatever you
make I should like match maybe like I
make I should like match maybe like I
try to like get an export of the puffer
try to like get an export of the puffer
that like matches or something and maybe
that like matches or something and maybe
we can like maybe if you want to touch
we can like maybe if you want to touch
up the frames or something but we should
up the frames or something but we should
have something so like could so like I
have something so like could so like I
can put the puffer as like a minion or
can put the puffer as like a minion or
whatever two bit style akin to Tiny
roges Silhouettes are really important
roges Silhouettes are really important
yeah the Silhouettes are really good on
yeah the Silhouettes are really good on
these
why is this one
why is this one
bigger oh I can't tell these don't
bigger oh I can't tell these don't
upscale properly so they don't look as
upscale properly so they don't look as
good as these ones but it's just cuz
good as these ones but it's just cuz
they're upscaled wrong
right this star is cool is the star for
right this star is cool is the star for
a specific buff or something or is this
a specific buff or something or is this
just to like animate the Tower
just to like animate the Tower
with yeah I know it's I know it's

Discord okay I like the snail the
snail's really good
good
ooh I'm trying to figure out I actually
ooh I'm trying to figure out I actually
I really like the particle effect
I really like the particle effect
animation how you have it here for some
animation how you have it here for some
reason I'm not getting that this is like
reason I'm not getting that this is like
a speed buff I see like the little
a speed buff I see like the little
Hermes wing on this but I'm not getting
Hermes wing on this but I'm not getting
the sense that it's a speed buff for
the sense that it's a speed buff for
some
some
reason star was
done oh I see cuz it's going around yeah
done oh I see cuz it's going around yeah
yeah okay I see how that
yeah okay I see how that
is it's funny because I'm using stars as
is it's funny because I'm using stars as
the freaking puffer Towers now
right
right
shapes you also don't have to limit
shapes you also don't have to limit
yourself to two bits right
yourself to two bits right
like even three you could do the boot
like even three you could do the boot
and the wing in one other shade and then
and the wing in one other shade and then
it would be more obvious what this
is these are
good not at

all what not what not what were you
replying to
specifically the snail shell is as well

for instance though it's pretty clear as
for instance though it's pretty clear as
is I really like the way you do your
is I really like the way you do your
animations like more than anything I
animations like more than anything I
love the animation so
love the animation so
much like I might like like be wondering
much like I might like like be wondering
about colors and stuff on these but like
about colors and stuff on these but like
the animations are so
the animations are so
good like they're really Snappy I like
good like they're really Snappy I like
them like the way this snail animates is

really good the way the star goes around
really good the way the star goes around
like this is also really good and then I
like this is also really good and then I
even like this particle effected like
even like this particle effected like
you really sell the animations
here account for
here account for
lag extra oh yeah yeah yeah you could do
lag extra oh yeah yeah yeah you could do
something I mean I don't even know if
something I mean I don't even know if
just for shading but like for some
just for shading but like for some
things to make stuff clear I mean the
things to make stuff clear I mean the
snail you can tell as a snail you could
snail you can tell as a snail you could
make the snail shell a different color
make the snail shell a different color
if you wanted you could do the boot and
if you wanted you could do the boot and
the wing a different color if you wanted
the wing a different color if you wanted
or you could just do like the particles
or you could just do like the particles
coming off the boot as a different color
coming off the boot as a different color
uh I I'll leave that up to you but
uh I I'll leave that up to you but
regardless like I really like the
regardless like I really like the
um the way that you do the animations is
um the way that you do the animations is
really
cool animation's much more important
yeah jeez These are
yeah jeez These are
nice wow
nice wow
the more I look at these the more I like
the more I look at these the more I like
him as well they just like these just
him as well they just like these just
feel
good you sent me some other ones before
good you sent me some other ones before
didn't
didn't
you things I'm thinking about in terms
you things I'm thinking about in terms
of okay yeah is this Geometry Dash or is
of okay yeah is this Geometry Dash or is
this I remember this game but yeah I
this I remember this game but yeah I
like this because it means less artwork
like this because it means less artwork
to
to
make okay crunchy yeah I see it without
make okay crunchy yeah I see it without
the this is like a dog or something
the this is like a dog or something
which is a little awkward but yeah I
see is this AI generated
SpongeBob I don't know about the AI
SpongeBob I don't know about the AI

SpongeBob okay this is
SpongeBob okay this is
cool not the CRT effect not doing CRT
cool not the CRT effect not doing CRT

whoa whoa whoa I haven't seen these
Psychonauts yeah they they do lots of
Psychonauts yeah they they do lots of
drugs in there I'm
sure okay I really like these actually
sure okay I really like these actually
the more I look at the these I actually
the more I look at the these I actually
really like these I think a couple of
really like these I think a couple of
the timings are a bit off
I like isn't this one here like too
I like isn't this one here like too
fast like you can't even see the middle
frame and the middle frame is really
frame and the middle frame is really
ridiculous because you can see it's like
ridiculous because you can see it's like
the fish head
I think usually the attack animation is
I think usually the attack animation is
like the most important thing because
like the most important thing because
that's the thing that you use a
that's the thing that you use a
lot walking animation is really good I
lot walking animation is really good I
like the
like the
idol this could be like a cast or
idol this could be like a cast or
something extra frame of
something extra frame of
exposure I think it could be like way
exposure I think it could be like way
too
too
uh let me
think it seems like way too slow right
think it seems like way too slow right
it's like the death animations on stuff
it's like the death animations on stuff
like this sometimes you actually they
like this sometimes you actually they
slow the death animations down right so
slow the death animations down right so
you can literally see like du or
you can literally see like du or
whatever
I don't know but regardless like you
I don't know but regardless like you
have the you have them it's just a
have the you have them it's just a
matter of like how many times things are
matter of like how many times things are
repeated these are solid I like
repeated these are solid I like
them I have to do is nice Sprite sheet
them I have to do is nice Sprite sheet
system for you I'll put in a lot of good
system for you I'll put in a lot of good
work on the uh the code tomorrow so
work on the uh the code tomorrow so
hopefully it'll start being easier to
hopefully it'll start being easier to
integrate stuff and then next week we'll
integrate stuff and then next week we'll
be able to really
be able to really
start I think you're getting stuck here
start I think you're getting stuck here
right you're getting stuck against the
right you're getting stuck against the
edge of the border right
edge of the border right
here cuz the tip of the sword is
here cuz the tip of the sword is
gone I think you're getting stuck
gone I think you're getting stuck
against like the edge of the
graphic I can't tell if it's in the
graphic I can't tell if it's in the
source or
not these are I just realized these are
not these are I just realized these are
going to look so much better as well
going to look so much better as well
when I get the actual source files or
when I get the actual source files or
like I get like the actual upscaled
like I get like the actual upscaled
versions that's not the stupid Discord
versions that's not the stupid Discord
version wait can I open this in the
version wait can I open this in the
browser and like does this give me
browser and like does this give me
better
upscaling nah it still upscales it
bad but I can tell it's going to be
bad but I can tell it's going to be
something pretty
cool that's awesome that is awesome
I like the
artwork BX yeah oh actually I can give
artwork BX yeah oh actually I can give
you a great example of the type of thing
you a great example of the type of thing
that I hate though I don't think you
that I hate though I don't think you
were going there in the first
place the way that these guys do all
place the way that these guys do all
their
their
logos they actually do a bunch of really
logos they actually do a bunch of really
good work for the field
good work for the field
but
like I do not like this type of thing
whatsoever there you go so not
this Sprite a day makes the coding okay
this Sprite a day makes the coding okay
very
true God it feels snoody yeah yeah yeah
true God it feels snoody yeah yeah yeah
right it's
right it's

I don't know I kind of realized
I don't know I kind of realized
something that like eventually I
something that like eventually I
probably don't have to care about this
probably don't have to care about this
now but actually here I don't have to
now but actually here I don't have to
pull it up on the screen because you
pull it up on the screen because you
have it on the puffer fish up uh up
have it on the puffer fish up uh up
there like eventually I'm going to get
there like eventually I'm going to get
trouble for doing the thing I'm going to
trouble for doing the thing I'm going to
get in trouble for doing the thing where
get in trouble for doing the thing where
like I add more logos to feed the puffer
like I add more logos to feed the puffer
or
or
whatever So eventually like somebody's
whatever So eventually like somebody's
going to get mad and I'll say screw it
going to get mad and I'll say screw it
and I'll just have the puffer inhale a

hey all my work inspiration comes from
hey all my work inspiration comes from
like old
games man
games man
I miss like all the
I miss like all the
cool game AI stuff that happened in like
cool game AI stuff that happened in like
2019 the open ai5 stuff was the
2019 the open ai5 stuff was the
coolest I still remember when I was like
coolest I still remember when I was like
there late one evening developing neural
there late one evening developing neural
MMO and like they were doing some early
MMO and like they were doing some early
like employee tests or whatever where
like employee tests or whatever where
they were trying to play the bot to see
they were trying to play the bot to see
like how good it was and uh Alec Radford
like how good it was and uh Alec Radford
who is the GPT guy I think he was just
who is the GPT guy I think he was just
one of the best DOTA players like that
one of the best DOTA players like that
they had as an employee so he would like
they had as an employee so he would like
lead and shot call the uh the matches
lead and shot call the uh the matches
versus the bot so I'd be there
versus the bot so I'd be there
developing neurl MMO and I'd hear like
developing neurl MMO and I'd hear like
across the office you know cuz open
across the office you know cuz open
Office like a dive CM for an extra kill
Office like a dive CM for an extra kill
it's like okay
it's like okay
[Laughter]
good fun times for
wish I could have gotten into DOTA
wish I could have gotten into DOTA
League lasting pissed me off resetting
League lasting pissed me off resetting
progress yeah that's why I played
progress yeah that's why I played
MMOs that's why I played the
MMOs that's why I played the
MMOs right
also just like mechanically it's like
also just like mechanically it's like
you can't keep up with the freaking kids
you can't keep up with the freaking kids
that are no life in those games
what's your
what's your
temperature on a coral or an En me to oh
temperature on a coral or an En me to oh
my gosh I don't know why I didn't think
my gosh I don't know why I didn't think
of that that's an awesome
of that that's an awesome
idea like a
idea like a
reef so the one thing that you have to
reef so the one thing that you have to
decide
decide
on uh is you need to figure out
on uh is you need to figure out
the
perspective you could just make it like
perspective you could just make it like
a typical like an older game where like
a typical like an older game where like
the perspective doesn't make any sense
the perspective doesn't make any sense
and it's
and it's
like cuz right now like you're looking
like cuz right now like you're looking
at the screen and like it's the like you
at the screen and like it's the like you
can see straight on so it's like a side
can see straight on so it's like a side
view but then the background isn't a
view but then the background isn't a
side view so
like like the towers would be like on
like like the towers would be like on
the bottom of the tank or something then
the bottom of the tank or something then
it wouldn't make sense so yeah I think
it wouldn't make sense so yeah I think
that you can just like put like a coral
that you can just like put like a coral
Tower type thing that'd be awesome like
Tower type thing that'd be awesome like
a
reef you only need to make uh
reef you only need to make uh
I think initially you only need to make
I think initially you only need to make
one of one of them and then just make it
one of one of them and then just make it
so that like we can retint like if
so that like we can retint like if
there's like let's say that there's like
there's like let's say that there's like
a base and then there like some coral
a base and then there like some coral
pieces on top or something like make it
pieces on top or something like make it
so that we can retint to swap the side
so that we can retint to swap the side
from like dire to
from like dire to
radiant would that make sense that way
radiant would that make sense that way
you only have to make one graphic like
you only have to make one graphic like
you know cuz they're two different sides
you know cuz they're two different sides
so we can just like retint like whatever
so we can just like retint like whatever
the accent is
the accent is
like to like from like uh cyan to red or
like to like from like uh cyan to red or
whatever so that we have like the
whatever so that we have like the
radiant and the dire
Side Oh by saying by what you're saying
Side Oh by saying by what you're saying
like that you never got into them but
like that you never got into them but
you know about like last hitting and
you know about like last hitting and
reset like last hits and stuff I assume
reset like last hits and stuff I assume
that you actually like know something
that you actually like know something
about the games then then you can Pro if
about the games then then you can Pro if
you do you can probably appreciate like
you do you can probably appreciate like
how crazy complicated
how crazy complicated
it is to be able to solve something like
it is to be able to solve something like
DOTA with reinforcement learning and how
DOTA with reinforcement learning and how
powerful the tech is like what that says
powerful the tech is like what that says
about the tech
about the tech
right like I don't think if you explain
right like I don't think if you explain
DOTA to most adults yeah very Jame game
DOTA to most adults yeah very Jame game
genre sound right yeah I would like if
genre sound right yeah I would like if
you explain DOTA to most adults I don't
you explain DOTA to most adults I don't
think that they would believe you that
think that they would believe you that
like typical people have a hobby that is
like typical people have a hobby that is
that insanely complicated
that insanely complicated
right like just think about the stuff in
right like just think about the stuff in
that game like how the hell does anybody
that game like how the hell does anybody
play that right is what you would
get no it's [ __ ] nuts how many Heroes
get no it's [ __ ] nuts how many Heroes
League with all the builds
League with all the builds
yeah
yeah they keep making it more and more
yeah they keep making it more and more
complicated as well which is the crazy
complicated as well which is the crazy
thing by adding more and more so it just
thing by adding more and more so it just
gets harder and harder to get into that
gets harder and harder to get into that
game
I actually pitched Riot on like some RL
I actually pitched Riot on like some RL
stuff with puffer a while ago they
stuff with puffer a while ago they
didn't go for it I have a good pitch but
didn't go for it I have a good pitch but
yeah let just let me appreciate fiddles
yeah let just let me appreciate fiddles
stick's character design and everything
stick's character design and everything
else is right
out I think character design wise my
out I think character design wise my
favorite has got to be Tren deir he's
favorite has got to be Tren deir he's
like a jacked Barbarian who's literally
like a jacked Barbarian who's literally
too angry to die
be like
trendir
right too angry to die is a top 10
right too angry to die is a top 10
Niche you're pretty good
Niche you're pretty good
it's pretty freaking
funny it's pretty
funny it's pretty
funny I actually think I like a lot of
funny I actually think I like a lot of
the DOTA character designs better though
the DOTA character designs better though
than the league
than the league
ones well some of the ones are pretty
good I remember I liked playing uh L in
good I remember I liked playing uh L in
League cuz he's just like her voice
League cuz he's just like her voice
lines are like all just obnoxiously
lines are like all just obnoxiously
optimistic
Rook I really liked Lena's character
design they have a lot of classic ones
design they have a lot of classic ones
like Lena and CM and then like V with
like Lena and CM and then like V with
the giant ass sword and
the giant ass sword and
like they a lot of good ones
too angry to die is like so
funny
for
for
e e
Nuclear
Nuclear
Throne let me look at that in a
second e
Nuclear
Throne
Throne
woh what's this
what is
this
uh so the way that the artwork is done
uh so the way that the artwork is done
is fine but the characters are way too
is fine but the characters are way too
zany in the in the uh the character like
zany in the in the uh the character like
designs are like way too zany for me oh
designs are like way too zany for me oh
the game looks completely
different yeah yeah okay the perspective
yeah it's like top down but not really I
yeah it's like top down but not really I
see what you mean yeah
hey
welcome to the Blurred
stream but are we cooking here
we might be cooking here
h
I have
now
for
for
for
e
e e
pretty much just uh hanging out chatting
pretty much just uh hanging out chatting
here for the next I don't know
here for the next I don't know
hourish while I finish
hourish while I finish
editing and that's pretty much the plan
unresponsive because I'm thumbnailing
unresponsive because I'm thumbnailing
Towers hey that's a good use of
Towers hey that's a good use of
time I'm just editing videos and trying
time I'm just editing videos and trying
to figure out how much stuff to cut in
to figure out how much stuff to cut in
between for promos and all that stuff
thumbnailing I know what it means to be
thumbnailing I know what it means to be
thumbnailing a tower
I'm actually getting to
I'm actually getting to
be okay enough with the video
editing
for
for e
the hardest
the hardest
part is making the tower not look like a
part is making the tower not look like a
bucket of freaking french
fries I don't know poal
oh you're using like I see you're using
oh you're using like I see you're using
like a weird image probably let me
think you could just do like a basic
think you could just do like a basic
Tower shape that sort of lower Fidelity
Tower shape that sort of lower Fidelity
and then have like some Coral sticking
and then have like some Coral sticking
out of it I don't
out of it I don't
know yeah if you do like the like the
know yeah if you do like the like the
tubular looking ones it's going to look
tubular looking ones it's going to look
like fries of course for
sand castles oh yeah that would work too
sand castles oh yeah that would work too
they'd be underwater but yeah that's
they'd be underwater but yeah that's
fine oh actually there is totally
a let me link you a Wiki page that has
a let me link you a Wiki page that has
some silly things in
it there's literally a dopest dungeon
it there's literally a dopest dungeon
that's set in the freaking sand
that's set in the freaking sand
castle and has like a bunch of corals
castle and has like a bunch of corals
and
stuff oh I forgot to tell you okay this
stuff oh I forgot to tell you okay this
is not going to work for this cuz it's
is not going to work for this cuz it's
like mixed inspiration but I can show
like mixed inspiration but I can show
you like one of my favorite designed
you like one of my favorite designed
places in a
game I should put put this in the uh the
Discord is there artwork in
here there's not enough artwork in
here there's not enough artwork in
it oh yeah there's a gallery at the
it oh yeah there's a gallery at the
bottom that you can see
that is a sick map yeah man there are
that is a sick map yeah man there are
like a couple games I've
like a couple games I've
played here I'll also link you the
played here I'll also link you the
chambers old school RuneScape has this
chambers old school RuneScape has this
really sweet raid that's set in this
really sweet raid that's set in this
like Crystal
Cave but yeah like basically all of that
Cave but yeah like basically all of that
game looks like that it's pretty cool
game looks like that it's pretty cool
right for like a freaking super old
right for like a freaking super old
Flash
Flash
game I'm trying to think of like some of
game I'm trying to think of like some of
the other ones that look really cool in
the other ones that look really cool in
that game
game what are like some iconic
game what are like some iconic
ones Chambers is
ones Chambers is
Eric yeah that's that's uh I just
Eric yeah that's that's uh I just
thought of it as like another thing that
thought of it as like another thing that
I thought looked cool I don't think it
I thought looked cool I don't think it
works for this because it's like
works for this because it's like
crystals it's not like
aquatic what other maps are there I'm
aquatic what other maps are there I'm
trying to think of like the dopest
trying to think of like the dopest
Maps if there's anything cool
there's actually a lot of them now that
there's actually a lot of them now that
I think of it I don't even know which
I think of it I don't even know which
one to
pick I know I won't force it right like
pick I know I won't force it right like
I just thought of that one because like
I just thought of that one because like
oh yeah sand castle oh yeah there's
oh yeah sand castle oh yeah there's
totally a sand castle right here's your
totally a sand castle right here's your
sand
castle for
I know a lot of like the artwork in MMOs
I know a lot of like the artwork in MMOs
just ends up being really cool because
just ends up being really cool because
like they'll design one piece of content
like they'll design one piece of content
in like a year because they know that
in like a year because they know that
people are going to do it a thousand
people are going to do it a thousand
times
so they'll be like shoot we better make
so they'll be like shoot we better make
sure the artwork at least looks good if
sure the artwork at least looks good if
we're going to literally design one
we're going to literally design one
thing all year
you're free to like look around those
you're free to like look around those
wikis MMO content pipeline is so slow
wikis MMO content pipeline is so slow
so because I can tell you what happens
so because I can tell you what happens
when it's not slow is you [ __ ] up the
when it's not slow is you [ __ ] up the
entire economy of the
entire economy of the
game like the balance
game like the balance
around the balance around like what
around the balance around like what
comes out of the content and
comes out of the content and
like yeah the balance of what comes out
like yeah the balance of what comes out
of it really important and like you want
of it really important and like you want
it to be like really rewarding on
it to be like really rewarding on
release
um but then the thing like if it's not
um but then the thing like if it's not
rewarding enough on release it's lame
rewarding enough on release it's lame
and then like it's lame to have to buff
and then like it's lame to have to buff
it after it's released but if it's too
it after it's released but if it's too
good on release then you just destroy
good on release then you just destroy
the entire economy of the whole
game like RuneScape did this they
game like RuneScape did this they
released like one relatively boring boss
released like one relatively boring boss
and I think it still might be the best
and I think it still might be the best
money in the entire game because it like
money in the entire game because it like
it drops the best armor and like nobody
it drops the best armor and like nobody
wants to do it but like it's like twice
wants to do it but like it's like twice
as much money as anything else in the
as much money as anything else in the
game because everybody needs a set of it
game because everybody needs a set of it
oops we probably should have made it
oops we probably should have made it
have like one piece of that armor and
have like one piece of that armor and
have it be more common and have spread
have it be more common and have spread
the other ones out across the rest of
the other ones out across the rest of
the game but oops it's too late now and
the game but oops it's too late now and
now we're screwed right it's like that
now we're screwed right it's like that
type of a thing
or they've done the opposite as well
or they've done the opposite as well
where it's like oops we released this
where it's like oops we released this
really cool boss that everybody likes
really cool boss that everybody likes
but we made the rewards not good enough
but we made the rewards not good enough
and uh now nobody's ever going to do
and uh now nobody's ever going to do
it botting make it a core
it botting make it a core
mechanic I mean the endgame content
mechanic I mean the endgame content
though like you're not botting the
though like you're not botting the
endgame content there are gold Farmers a
endgame content there are gold Farmers a
few of them that can do it but like yeah
I will tell you that the gold farming
I will tell you that the gold farming
actually completely it will actually
actually completely it will actually
completely destroy a game is the problem
completely destroy a game is the problem
like okay cool they're cheap resources
like okay cool they're cheap resources
right but like they're all they're not
right but like they're all they're not
just farming the resources they're also
just farming the resources they're also
farming bosses and stuff and they'll
farming bosses and stuff and they'll
drop the prices of the things that come
drop the prices of the things that come
from the bosses so much that it's
from the bosses so much that it's
literally never worth it for anybody to
literally never worth it for anybody to
do them ever
again which is the silly
thing
for
for for
I should order
I should order
dinner real
dinner real
quick get some food and then I will
quick get some food and then I will
continue working on this until food gets
continue working on this until food gets
here uh we got some decent progress I'd
here uh we got some decent progress I'd
say today
say today
I mean to be fair I didn't get as much
I mean to be fair I didn't get as much
done on the video as I wanted to but I
done on the video as I wanted to but I
literally solved an RL environment today
literally solved an RL environment today
so
huge what's huge oh yeah yeah
huge what's huge oh yeah yeah
yeah I
yeah I
uh I had a
uh I had a
conversation with uh one of the
conversation with uh one of the
researchers on GPU drive it was very
researchers on GPU drive it was very
nice and uh very smart good researcher
nice and uh very smart good researcher
right and uh she said well you know it's
right and uh she said well you know it's
already pretty fast you know we can
already pretty fast you know we can
already run these experiments in like in
already run these experiments in like in
like a couple of hours said okay let me
like a couple of hours said okay let me
work on that and uh like 4 hours later I
work on that and uh like 4 hours later I
sent back like okay I have the thing
sent back like okay I have the thing
training uh it takes 28
seconds yeah it takes 28 seconds now and
seconds yeah it takes 28 seconds now and
uh I had the the pi was the pi for that
uh I had the the pi was the pi for that
who I know right joined the stream and I
who I know right joined the stream and I
said hey I got something to show you let
said hey I got something to show you let
me show you the uh the training graphs
me show you the uh the training graphs
for this you know these experiments I've
for this you know these experiments I've
been running and he thought that the
been running and he thought that the
axis was in minutes and I said no the
axis was in minutes and I said no the
axis is in
seconds no no no the axis is in seconds
seconds no no no the axis is in seconds
what do you take me
what do you take me
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
for so that's fun hopefully that
for so that's fun hopefully that
environment will be like Ultra widely
environment will be like Ultra widely
used now just cuz like it's such a good
used now just cuz like it's such a good
environment just needed like a little
environment just needed like a little
bit more on the perf side
am I stupid for wanting to order from
am I stupid for wanting to order from
Panera Bread of all freaking
places I used to remember the food
places I used to remember the food
quality being so much
higher I really want a chicken soup
nah man I don't need the
nah man I don't need the
calories I've been okay I'm like I'm
calories I've been okay I'm like I'm
pretty much just maintaining at the
moment it's going to take me another
moment it's going to take me another
couple weeks to get back to the really
couple weeks to get back to the really
heavy lifts I mean I did the what's this
heavy lifts I mean I did the what's this
three weeks weeks I think now three
three weeks weeks I think now three
weeks after the
50K for
how do we Implement a how do we
how do we Implement a how do we
Implement a paper as a begin give me one
Implement a paper as a begin give me one
second I'm trying to find myself some
second I'm trying to find myself some
food to order and I will answer some
food to order and I will answer some
questions
just a
just a
second I am being dumb and indecisive at
second I am being dumb and indecisive at
the moment
let's get a
let's get a
pasta some freaking vegetables though
man I don't know
mood let me figure this out I I have
mood let me figure this out I I have
some cool paper tips
but I don't know my brain just stops
but I don't know my brain just stops
working about food at some point it's
working about food at some point it's
just like what how do I
eat I guess the only thing I have that I
eat I guess the only thing I have that I
know works is
actually just do an
omelette yeah that was good
add I don't know why I took that long
add I don't know why I took that long
for
this all right
so it depends if you're talking about an
so it depends if you're talking about an
ml paper or an RL paper um
there's going to be a lot of difference
there's going to be a lot of difference
there
there
so a lot of ml papers tend to be like
so a lot of ml papers tend to be like
architecture heavy and
architecture heavy and
such and the main difficulty is like
such and the main difficulty is like
getting the architecture to be just
getting the architecture to be just
right a lot of RL
right a lot of RL
papers tend to be the train Loop is a
papers tend to be the train Loop is a
lot harder to implement um because you
lot harder to implement um because you
generally have separate train phases you
generally have separate train phases you
maybe have a replay but maybe you have
maybe have a replay but maybe you have
to do generalized Advantage estimation
to do generalized Advantage estimation
there tends to be a lot like multiple
there tends to be a lot like multiple
data State data collection phases uh and
data State data collection phases uh and
the data comes from the simulator as
the data comes from the simulator as
well so you have to work with
well so you have to work with
that
that
uh so I mean I did this when I
started I would suggest picking
started I would suggest picking
something that doesn't take a ton of
something that doesn't take a ton of
compute to
compute to
train because if you're going to pick
train because if you're going to pick
something that you don't have the
something that you don't have the
resources to do properly you'll
resources to do properly you'll
basically have zero way of checking
basically have zero way of checking
whether your implementation is correct
whether your implementation is correct
or
or
not
not
um
yeah that's what I would generally
yeah that's what I would generally
suggest is that's probably the single
suggest is that's probably the single
most important thing
most important thing
honestly I did when I oh also pick a
honestly I did when I oh also pick a
paper that actually makes sense to read
paper that actually makes sense to read
like some papers are just ridiculously
like some papers are just ridiculously
written with way too much math and not
written with way too much math and not
enough details to actually Implement
enough details to actually Implement
properly
I think when I started I did like encode
I think when I started I did like encode
decode
decode
lstms uh for language modeling and I did
lstms uh for language modeling and I did
like uh variational Auto
like uh variational Auto
encoders uh yeah I think those were the
encoders uh yeah I think those were the
two big ones and then basically once
two big ones and then basically once
you've implemented a few papers it's
you've implemented a few papers it's
like congratulations now it's time to do
like congratulations now it's time to do
your own
research I'm trying to think if it's
research I'm trying to think if it's
still worth trying to implement papers
still worth trying to implement papers
these days
I honestly don't know if it's worth
I honestly don't know if it's worth
trying to implement papers these
days I think it's worth trying to
days I think it's worth trying to
implement basic methods but trying to
implement basic methods but trying to
implement full papers
like paper and reinforcement
like paper and reinforcement
learning you should imp like you should
learning you should imp like you should
Implement some for form of reinforcement
Implement some for form of reinforcement
learning train Loop uh when you star in
learning train Loop uh when you star in
reinforcement learning if you're trying
reinforcement learning if you're trying
to take it
to take it
seriously like something as simple as
seriously like something as simple as
dqn or like vanilla policy gradients or
dqn or like vanilla policy gradients or
whatever is
whatever is
fine um there are really good
fine um there are really good
implementations that you can refer to
implementations that you can refer to
nowadays these didn't used to exist but
nowadays these didn't used to exist but
clean RL has some like really good and
clean RL has some like really good and
simple reference
implementations I would generally
implementations I would generally
suggest doing like vanilla policy
suggest doing like vanilla policy
gradients
gradients
honestly do like vanilla policy
honestly do like vanilla policy
gradients on cart Pole or something
gradients on cart Pole or something
basic like
basic like
that that'll be like 200 lines of code
that that'll be like 200 lines of code
there are all sorts of good resources on
there are all sorts of good resources on
it it'll let you understand the anatomy
it it'll let you understand the anatomy
of the train
Loop but the thing is you're not going
Loop but the thing is you're not going
to get like a super cool result out of
to get like a super cool result out of
it right you're just going to get
it right you're just going to get
something
basic now if you're looking to get more
basic now if you're looking to get more
into like The Cutting Edge of RL but
into like The Cutting Edge of RL but
you're not looking to get into the side
you're not looking to get into the side
where you need tons and tons of
where you need tons and tons of
algorithmic knowledge I we have tons of
algorithmic knowledge I we have tons of
cool stuff around in puffer lib like I
cool stuff around in puffer lib like I
have new contributors that I've been
have new contributors that I've been
showing how to write million step per
showing how to write million step per
second like ultra high performance
second like ultra high performance
environments so we have some people that
environments so we have some people that
are like implementing the Atari games
are like implementing the Atari games
from scratch but like the Atari games
from scratch but like the Atari games
now Run a thousand times faster so we
now Run a thousand times faster so we
can train Ultra well and then they're
can train Ultra well and then they're
like using puffer to run run their
like using puffer to run run their
experiments and then they're running
experiments and then they're running
like their own hyper parameter sweeps
like their own hyper parameter sweeps
and stuff so we have that type of a
and stuff so we have that type of a
thing going on but if you really want to
thing going on but if you really want to
like know the algorithm side vanilla
like know the algorithm side vanilla
policy gradients or dqn from scratch
policy gradients or dqn from scratch
would be the general
suggestion stuff gets harder after that
suggestion stuff gets harder after that
like good po implementations even like
like good po implementations even like
poo is one of the simpler algorithms but
poo is one of the simpler algorithms but
honestly really good RL implementations
honestly really good RL implementations
can take months
like if I had to implement Po from
like if I had to implement Po from
scratch right now even having done that
scratch right now even having done that
multiple times I it would take me a long
multiple times I it would take me a long
time to do
well cuz things are just tricky man it's
well cuz things are just tricky man it's
just
tricky for
I will also say when I started an
I will also say when I started an
ml uh and I tried to do a lot of stuff
ml uh and I tried to do a lot of stuff
from scratch there was much pain in
from scratch there was much pain in
suffering like I spent many thousands of
suffering like I spent many thousands of
hours from age like 16
hours from age like 16
to
to
20 pretty much age 16 to 20 was all just
20 pretty much age 16 to 20 was all just
like stum in around trying to do [ __ ]
like stum in around trying to do [ __ ]
and everything being really hard and
and everything being really hard and
confusing and everything taking 20 times
confusing and everything taking 20 times
longer than it should
um but hey I mean the Crux of that was
um but hey I mean the Crux of that was
like when I finally sort of figured some
like when I finally sort of figured some
stuff out and I managed to get soda on
stuff out and I managed to get soda on
like a really simple language modeling
like a really simple language modeling
task uh and I was able like I published
task uh and I was able like I published
My First Single author paper off of that
My First Single author paper off of that
and I mean from that I got you know my
and I mean from that I got you know my
open AI internship and you know then I
open AI internship and you know then I
got into my PhD and you know all sorts
got into my PhD and you know all sorts
of things from
there it's a little tough cuz the things
there it's a little tough cuz the things
that I did back then would no longer be
that I did back then would no longer be
considered
considered
impressive and like it's actually kind
impressive and like it's actually kind
of fair because it's not like oh yeah
of fair because it's not like oh yeah
the people just got way smarter that's
the people just got way smarter that's
why everybody's doing better stuff now
why everybody's doing better stuff now
it's uh that the tools got better so
it's uh that the tools got better so
like the stuff that we did back then was
like the stuff that we did back then was
really hard to do CU we didn't even have
really hard to do CU we didn't even have
half different learn decent learning
half different learn decent learning
libraries but nowadays like you have
libraries but nowadays like you have
that stuff so the bar goes up a
ton for
sounds like a grandpa talking about 8
sounds like a grandpa talking about 8
megabyte hdds they could sit on a table
megabyte hdds they could sit on a table
Yeah but Gramp's got
hands is Gramp's got
hands thumbnails ooh hold
hands thumbnails ooh hold
on let me fix one thing
what
what
ooh let me
ooh let me
un how do you work this fast the [ __ ]
you made a lot of different Towers
you made a lot of different Towers
didn't
didn't
you
holy did you make six of them for a
holy did you make six of them for a
particular
reason I can see
reason I can see
Silhouettes draw a long
time I think
technically I think I can technically
technically I think I can technically
make these like tier one tier two tier
make these like tier one tier two tier
three tier four tier five
I'd have to modify a little bit of how
I'd have to modify a little bit of how
the game represents the
towers part of the thumbnailing I'd
towers part of the thumbnailing I'd
never heard the word thumbnailing
never heard the word thumbnailing
process
okay does doing Alpha Zero from sort of
okay does doing Alpha Zero from sort of
scratch
help that seems [ __ ] hard I'd have to
help that seems [ __ ] hard I'd have to
look at the details of that paper it's
look at the details of that paper it's
been so long does that seem like
been so long does that seem like
something reasonable that you can
something reasonable that you can
do disposable let me
do disposable let me
see so I think that this one right here
see so I think that this one right here
we could scale this one up like 4X and
we could scale this one up like 4X and
use this as the uh the ancient or
whatever I think my favorites are this
whatever I think my favorites are this
one this one and this
one this one and this
one I'm trying to think what I want to
one I'm trying to think what I want to
use each of them
for looks good
I mean you've drawn some stuff that like
I mean you've drawn some stuff that like
probably lends itself to some really
probably lends itself to some really
cool like three frame
animations with like the stuff on the
top number
top number
five is your personal Peck
number five is pretty
good yeah this one's nice and simple
good yeah this one's nice and simple
this one works in your two uh two bit
this one works in your two uh two bit
art style very well well maybe it does I
art style very well well maybe it does I
think it I think it would also look
think it I think it would also look
better with three colors um like the
better with three colors um like the
base the outline and then like the
base the outline and then like the
top I think that the one on the left
top I think that the one on the left
here this one could be really cool for
here this one could be really cool for
the ancient cuz you know what this
the ancient cuz you know what this
reminds me of this like this looks like
reminds me of this like this looks like
this could be like a vent you know like
this could be like a vent you know like
a like a vent like the underwater vent
a like a vent like the underwater vent
or whatever and like this like stuff
or whatever and like this like stuff
could be like you know whatever Vapors
could be like you know whatever Vapors
or whatever floating up from like an
or whatever floating up from like an
underwater
underwater
vent that would be like a really cool
vent that would be like a really cool
like Nexus you know like the objective
like Nexus you know like the objective
of the game
thing yeah I think I think if you want
thing yeah I think I think if you want
to just
to just
do two two of them it would be these
do two two of them it would be these
two a
two a
pearl
e you know what I would use a pearl
e you know what I would use a pearl
for I don't
know star Pearl if I were to like Bounty
know star Pearl if I were to like Bounty
runes or something like that to the game
runes or something like that to the game
which I don't have yet so you don't have
which I don't have yet so you don't have
to make it at the moment but like you
to make it at the moment but like you
could totally make the Bounty runes be
could totally make the Bounty runes be
like a clam or like an oyster where like
like a clam or like an oyster where like
when the bounty Rune isn't there the
when the bounty Rune isn't there the
oyster is closed and when the bounty
oyster is closed and when the bounty
Rune is there it's like open with like a
Rune is there it's like open with like a
pearl in
it
right that'd be pretty cool
they are sweet
looking
looking
oops Let's
oops Let's
uh sneak
preview I'll clean up five and hold on
preview I'll clean up five and hold on
to one sounds good
where's my
[Music]
food technically I have shown portions
food technically I have shown portions
of this on stream but then I got way
of this on stream but then I got way
more serious about it I'm like okay
more serious about it I'm like okay
we're going to like hide this so that
we're going to like hide this so that
it'll be
special
for

uhoh
there we
go

there we go food's on the
there we go food's on the

way so
10 15
10 15
minutes so how long I have to finish up
minutes so how long I have to finish up
the initial edits on this
the initial edits on this
video I think I'm good I basically just
video I think I'm good I basically just
have a couple
have a couple
transitions to
finish and then we'll be good
hey
welcome usually we're writing code here
welcome usually we're writing code here
I'm not writing code because I'm
I'm not writing code because I'm
finishing this ridiculously labor
finishing this ridiculously labor
intensive video in the background that's
intensive video in the background that's
all
all
blurry um I'm hoping that this will be
blurry um I'm hoping that this will be
up next week and then I'll be able to be
up next week and then I'll be able to be
doing cool code on stream all week but
doing cool code on stream all week but
for now I'm hanging around chatting
for now I'm hanging around chatting
about reinforcement learning and
about reinforcement learning and
finishing up edits

learning RL by reading rs's RL book and
learning RL by reading rs's RL book and
implementing it or if I should start
implementing it or if I should start
with Pokemon
with Pokemon
RL can you give me some advice on how I
RL can you give me some advice on how I
should start learning reinforcement
should start learning reinforcement
learning uh so I it depends on whether
learning uh so I it depends on whether
you have experience in any other areas
you have experience in any other areas
of AI like do you have experience with
of AI like do you have experience with
any other areas of
any other areas of
ml or is this like brand new to RL well
ml or is this like brand new to RL well
it's like I should actually start with
it's like I should actually start with
like do you have experience in software
like do you have experience in software
engineering do you have experience in
engineering do you have experience in
like any math do you have experience in
like any math do you have experience in
AI as a whole in like Visionary language
AI as a whole in like Visionary language
like what are we starting with
I have experience with NLP okay great so
I have experience with NLP okay great so
that's where I was when I started as
that's where I was when I started as
well I generally suggest people read
well I generally suggest people read
some papers not a ton like between five
some papers not a ton like between five
and 10 papers in RL to get a sense of
and 10 papers in RL to get a sense of
things these would be like
things these would be like
dqn uh
po oh how many do I pick if I had did
po oh how many do I pick if I had did
pick
five okay we'll be super biased and I'll

include mine as one of them uh

po uh DOTA open ai5 Alpha
po uh DOTA open ai5 Alpha
star and the puffer paper because I'll
star and the puffer paper because I'll
be biased on my own
be biased on my own
there that will give you a pretty decent
there that will give you a pretty decent
grounding
grounding
of in like at least some of RL obviously
of in like at least some of RL obviously
you'll want to read some more than some
you'll want to read some more than some
more along the way but that will give
more along the way but that will give
you some
you some
grounding then on the Practical side I
grounding then on the Practical side I
would look at
would look at
you should understand like vanilla
you should understand like vanilla
policy gradients and like what a q
policy gradients and like what a q
function
function
is and outside of that I would suggest
is and outside of that I would suggest
looking at clean RL and getting familiar
looking at clean RL and getting familiar
with some of those
with some of those
implementations and uh from there you
implementations and uh from there you
can probably start looking at some of
can probably start looking at some of
the stuff in poer lib because like we
the stuff in poer lib because like we
really aren't that algorithm
really aren't that algorithm
heavy um most of the stuff that's in
heavy um most of the stuff that's in
poer that lets you do cool work is just
poer that lets you do cool work is just
like we've done engineering to make
like we've done engineering to make
things very very simple and very very
things very very simple and very very
fast so it's like the same po
fast so it's like the same po
implementation basically as clean rl's
implementation basically as clean rl's
but ours is like 100 times faster
thank you yeah no worries and by the way
thank you yeah no worries and by the way
we've got
we've got
like we have new people who have like
like we have new people who have like
contributed tons to the Pokemon project
contributed tons to the Pokemon project
um that started out with less experience
um that started out with less experience
than you and just like worked a bunch on
than you and just like worked a bunch on
stuff we have other other people that
stuff we have other other people that
are in a similar spot to you uh even
are in a similar spot to you uh even

need the logic needs to be fast is the

main thing
that's the hard part
so obnoxious I can't just add a freaking

cross disolve here
guess this is good enough
right okay that's a good initial
right okay that's a good initial
edit we
edit we
have just over 25 minutes of footage for
have just over 25 minutes of footage for
the video
the video
um food's almost here so this is where
um food's almost here so this is where
I'm going to call it for today folks let
I'm going to call it for today folks let
me close this and I can undo the blur
me close this and I can undo the blur
and all the other stuff
um okay
so thanks for dropping by everyone um
so thanks for dropping by everyone um
Tower in 30 seconds okay I'll wait for
that this article this puffer Hardware
that this article this puffer Hardware
article was uh from 325 Stars just like
article was uh from 325 Stars just like
two three months ago not
two three months ago not
even so uh if you want to support the
even so uh if you want to support the
project for
project for
free and have Ultra fast reinforcement
free and have Ultra fast reinforcement
learning you can contribute to this as
learning you can contribute to this as
well by the way and we do cool stuff on
well by the way and we do cool stuff on
stream with
stream with
contributors um but yeah hey we hit 875
contributors um but yeah hey we hit 875
today which is awesome I'll put the link
today which is awesome I'll put the link
in the
in the
chat you can start the project to help
chat you can start the project to help
us
us
out you can also join the Discord we've
out you can also join the Discord we've
got lots of people developing really
got lots of people developing really
cool simulators which is the main push
cool simulators which is the main push
for puffer going forward here this video
for puffer going forward here this video
is going to be done over the weekend and
is going to be done over the weekend and
out probably
out probably
Monday uh and after that it'll be back
Monday uh and after that it'll be back
to all the cool Dev so that'll be fun
to all the cool Dev so that'll be fun
let's take a look at this artwork
so will be
so will be
awesome
awesome
[Music]
[Music]
whoa hold
whoa hold
on now with
shading
whoa it's going to need some color for
whoa it's going to need some color for
like the coral on the top or something
like the coral on the top or something
right cuz it's not going to stand out
right cuz it's not going to stand out
from the dark background but yeah this
from the dark background but yeah this
shade is awesome holy
shade is awesome holy
I think wait to upgrade the characters
I think wait to upgrade the characters
until
until
um until we see if we finalize stuff
um until we see if we finalize stuff
because I know it's like way harder to
because I know it's like way harder to
edit once you start shading and stuff
edit once you start shading and stuff
but yeah holy
hell holy hell this is
hell holy hell this is
nice wait is this supposed to be
nice wait is this supposed to be
something is this supposed to be like a
something is this supposed to be like a
face or something here or is this just
face or something here or is this just
like just so happens to be I can't tell
this is going to be so cool to have
this is going to be so cool to have
these as
Towers that's
awesome I I think that if you want to do
awesome I I think that if you want to do
a couple little things today like figure
a couple little things today like figure
out like what portion I think like the
out like what portion I think like the
coral bit at the top would probably get
coral bit at the top would probably get
the tint on it something's going to have
the tint on it something's going to have
to be can and something's going to have
to be can and something's going to have
to be red to represent the two different
to be red to represent the two different
teams so like you know maybe this piece
teams so like you know maybe this piece
is red for the dire team and like Canan
is red for the dire team and like Canan
for the radiant team or whatever um I
for the radiant team or whatever um I
don't know maybe some like some sort of
don't know maybe some like some sort of
little static animation for this thing
little static animation for this thing
technically it could get an attack
technically it could get an attack
animation where like it blinks or
animation where like it blinks or
something when it attacks or something
something when it attacks or something
like that it just does an AOE basically
like that it just does an AOE basically
it does like a massive like it like hits
it does like a massive like it like hits
something it hits something in a big
something it hits something in a big
range around it so I could either do
range around it so I could either do
some sort of projectile or if that's too
some sort of projectile or if that's too
hard we could just like blink it I don't
know I can't see it on the black
background so this is what I mean though
background so this is what I mean though
like you you can't really see it on the
like you you can't really see it on the
black background and like we have a
black background and like we have a
pretty dark background
pretty dark background
for H
interesting [ __ ]
jpeg it cool though I like
it and you can pretty much keep doing
it and you can pretty much keep doing
whatever like you make cool stuff I use
whatever like you make cool stuff I use
it
like this is awesome
you could also take a look at the
you could also take a look at the
uh these anims I shant give you slop
uh these anims I shant give you slop
yeah these are awesome I really like
yeah these are awesome I really like
your
your
animations especially like
you know what this like the winged boot
you know what this like the winged boot
reminds me
of these literally exist in old school
of these literally exist in old school
they got like the wings on
they got like the wings on
them remind me of
these all right I've got to go get my
these all right I've got to go get my
food I'm hungry uh I'm going to be
food I'm hungry uh I'm going to be
deving a bunch of SE probably off stream
deving a bunch of SE probably off stream
tomorrow trying to clean some stuff up
tomorrow trying to clean some stuff up
and then we'll be back Monday with
and then we'll be back Monday with
proper Dev uh but yeah we've done quite
proper Dev uh but yeah we've done quite
a bit of cool
a bit of cool
stuff so thanks everyone and uh I will
stuff so thanks everyone and uh I will
see you later bye

Kind: captions
Language: en
okay we should be live let's
see
see
yep cool
yep cool
so uh we
so uh we
are going to do a couple quick things
here goal for today just circled back
here goal for today just circled back
with the GPU Drive BS and we're going to
with the GPU Drive BS and we're going to
see if we can fix up that
see if we can fix up that
simulator so
simulator so
that looks
good it's been a while since I've played
good it's been a while since I've played
with
with
this let me see if I can figure this out
this let me see if I can figure this out
um
Docker I think it was on on puffer box
Docker I think it was on on puffer box
one
maybe uh this looks good it has GPU
maybe uh this looks good it has GPU
drive on it
right and this box got rebooted anyway
right and this box got rebooted anyway
so we're fine so um
there's a bunch of stuff here we don't
there's a bunch of stuff here we don't
care about any of this we do care about
care about any of this we do care about
this demo file
this demo file
so the thing that was happening that got
so the thing that was happening that got
me stuck on this
me stuck on this
before hold on let me fix the
before hold on let me fix the
stream uh the thing that happened that
stream uh the thing that happened that
got me stuck on this before was that
got me stuck on this before was that
there's this crash in
there's this crash in
madona uh the basically means
madona uh the basically means
that you can't run sweeps the way you
that you can't run sweeps the way you
normally
would oops you can't run sweeps the way
would oops you can't run sweeps the way
that you normally would because uh you
that you normally would because uh you
can't make multiple copies of the
can't make multiple copies of the
environment it just like it crashes it
environment it just like it crashes it
out of memories it does weird things so
out of memories it does weird things so
what we're going to do to fix this
where's this thing called
where's this thing called
train okay right here elos equals elos
train okay right here elos equals elos
let's
do this will run in a sub
do this will run in a sub
process and now we have to add this
process and now we have to add this
extra
extra
ARG admittedly I don't like floing the
ARG admittedly I don't like floing the
demo file but whatever you know we'll do
demo file but whatever you know we'll do
it for
it for
this sub process equal
false and then what we'll do
is very
is very
gross but uh this is
cheeky that's not what I wanted to do it
cheeky that's not what I wanted to do it
all um let me
see I need to see my other code to see
see I need to see my other code to see
how I want to do
this back in multiprocessing
this back in multiprocessing
[Music]
where is this
thing process multiprocessing import
thing process multiprocessing import
process
and okay so basically what I want to do
and okay so basically what I want to do
is I want to just call this thing um
is I want to just call this thing um
with subprocess false but now it's in a
subprocess b.
start and
then where's the darn process API
p.
p.
jooin where do I get the results out
come on is there not an easy way to get
come on is there not an easy way to get
the results out at the end of a process
the results out at the end of a process
like this it has to be
like this it has to be
right oh I forgot I disabled the chat as
right oh I forgot I disabled the chat as
well let me fix
well let me fix
that just go to the stream
that just go to the stream
view yeah there we go
like this
[Music]
get output of the process function
get output of the process function
python
on subprocess check
on subprocess check
output is is all old
process
process
run join
terminate kill
close is there no way to get the output
close is there no way to get the output
of a
process this is a
process this is a
q I forget that these things are always
q I forget that these things are always
way more obnoxious
way more obnoxious
uh then I would
uh then I would
think hold
think hold
[Music]
[Music]
on maybe this has better
docks is it going to tell me to put it
docks is it going to tell me to put it
into a queue really
yep that's so
yep that's so
dumb that's incredibly
stupid you got to be kidding me
okay is there a way I can do this
okay is there a way I can do this
without making a mess of all this nice
without making a mess of all this nice
code that I've
written we'll just do it we'll just do
written we'll just do it we'll just do
it quick for
now we'll give it a
Q and then
Q and then
uh if Q is not
uh if Q is not
none
you.put stats
yellow
yellow
okay we'll see how this goes so we have
okay we'll see how this goes so we have
uh We've made a subprocess option where
uh We've made a subprocess option where
we just stick all this garbage into a
we just stick all this garbage into a
queue and then we get it back out of the
queue and then we get it back out of the
queue
yeah so now what we're going to do is we
yeah so now what we're going to do is we
will see if we can run GPU drive if I
will see if we can run GPU drive if I
have the thing set up correctly and if I
have the thing set up correctly and if I
can start an actual hyper pram sweep
let's see what this
let's see what this
does and mind you I think I've made uh
does and mind you I think I've made uh
I've made some substantial improvements
I've made some substantial improvements
to our vectorization into other things
to our vectorization into other things
as well since uh I did this originally
200k steps per
200k steps per
second very nice
indeed
so GPU drives 10 mil time
so GPU drives 10 mil time
steps oh they said that there was
steps oh they said that there was
stepanie said that there was
stepanie said that there was
uh you drive they had a a wand B
somewhere
somewhere

where's said there's a wanie somewhere

right dependencies
contribution guidelines and WB
report that link points to a learning

Benchmark okay this is
where check the 1B report
where check the 1B report
here okay
I don't know this
I don't know this
is hold
is hold
on we'll log into to the
on we'll log into to the
puffer count which will go
here go like
this and
dang so this is
dang so this is
not you actually can't change whoops
not you actually can't change whoops
let's not do
let's not do
that not have freaking door Dash
oh okay here you can see that this is 10
oh okay here you can see that this is 10
mil steps
right so yeah a 10 mil step should be
fine let's see how fast we can do this I
fine let's see how fast we can do this I
bet we can just do this super
fast 10 mil time steps
Max
episode what is this Max episode
steps wait hold
steps wait hold
on that doesn't make sense
right environments

epis sweep. parameters. m.p
parameters well that's just doesn't
parameters well that's just doesn't
exist right this doesn't exist I don't
exist right this doesn't exist I don't
know why this is here yo Nathan what's
know why this is here yo Nathan what's
up I I didn't know last stream when you
up I I didn't know last stream when you
said like hey check Discord for progress
said like hey check Discord for progress
I thought you were talking about like
I thought you were talking about like
breakout I didn't realize you'd made a
breakout I didn't realize you'd made a
whole mockup of the uh that PVP
whole mockup of the uh that PVP
environment that is awesome I am
environment that is awesome I am
absolutely Ely down to help you with
absolutely Ely down to help you with
that that is
awesome well done
seriously okay this should be
solid uh
TKS just finishing a cup up a couple
TKS just finishing a cup up a couple
things
things
here mode train back
go oh no
go oh no
mode swe carbs vac
native that's it
right we'll see if I messed up or not
really init Cuda
error uh
I
mean what the heck is this right
set Cuda Cuda set device GPU
ID Cuda
free if I run this without a sweep does
free if I run this without a sweep does
it work
okay so this actually runs fine
okay so this actually runs fine
I'm curious then
why it shouldn't error on the first run
right well I have to go for the slightly
right well I have to go for the slightly
more annoying uh option here I want to
more annoying uh option here I want to
just be able to subprocess like this but
just be able to subprocess like this but
I guess I can't do that so I'm going to
I guess I can't do that so I'm going to
have to add
have to add
um what cash back
this should
this should
work and then I have
work and then I have
to man I have to return the V en as well
silly let's get rid of
this okay so we're going to do back end
this okay so we're going to do back end
equal backend right and then this will
equal backend right and then this will
be new
be new
ELO then this will be ven
and I'll have to
and I'll have to
do back it's
none so now the goal is that we just
none so now the goal is that we just
cash the
ven cannot access local variable
ven cannot access local variable
vcm
really why does elos
work but vam
doesn't Somebody explain
doesn't Somebody explain
that Unbound local
this should absolutely work because I
this should absolutely work because I
have right here this is this should be
have right here this is this should be
in scope
in scope
right unless I have like a ve
and oh right here because you can't
and oh right here because you can't
assign to
assign to
it that's why
that's
silly so we'll just do like
silly so we'll just do like
this so that process should not be
true very
silly so it says vam is none
here initialization
here initialization
finished running GPU Drive super fast
speed is very highly
speed is very highly
variable very highly
variable but uh yeah there you go this
variable but uh yeah there you go this
should be done in 20 more
should be done in 20 more
seconds which means we
are what's that 20 times faster than the
are what's that 20 times faster than the
baseline or whatever
got a Need for
Speed how's the stream
Speed how's the stream
doing warming up a bit
GPU Drive torch has no attribute Sim
really
ah because we did close on this
right
right
[Music]
so oh that's an e that's an easy effects
what do we think about
that that should work
right let me start to sweep up
okay so that's first
okay so that's first
experiment now it's doing the final eval
experiment now it's doing the final eval
so it gets an accurate estimate
so it gets an accurate estimate
and
then we get observed value we get up
then we get observed value we get up
time and it
time and it
works yay
that was way easier than I thought it
that was way easier than I thought it
was going to be honestly I'm kind of
was going to be honestly I'm kind of
embarrassed that I just didn't do that
embarrassed that I just didn't do that
to begin
with yeah this
with yeah this
works all right I will be right back and
works all right I will be right back and
then we'll see what this is accomplished
and uh hopefully we'll be able to just
and uh hopefully we'll be able to just
leave this and I'll either edit on the
leave this and I'll either edit on the
video and answer some questions or do
video and answer some questions or do
some other things we'll see what we uh
some other things we'll see what we uh
what we've got let me Discord real
what we've got let me Discord real
quick see if there's an update on any of
quick see if there's an update on any of
these Sims that people have been
these Sims that people have been
building
interesting this guy did some nice work
interesting this guy did some nice work
for me here
I think I'm all caught up with the
I think I'm all caught up with the
Discord
actually yeah
actually yeah
okay we'll leave this be here
okay we'll leave this be here
and I'll be right
back
e
e e
hey
hey
Will are you
there you there you need some help with
there you there you need some help with
Docs
go get him back is he
streaming he's not even streaming where

able to Dev properly because these
able to Dev properly because these
freaking
freaking
videos um
videos um
the new one will be done soon I'm
the new one will be done soon I'm
actually just waiting to see if this
actually just waiting to see if this
this does anything um because I think
this does anything um because I think
that I might have a couple bugs in GPU
that I might have a couple bugs in GPU
drive and then I'm going to switch over
drive and then I'm going to switch over
in a little bit to do
in a little bit to do
uh to work on the video once this is for
uh to work on the video once this is for
sure working
it's kind of weird that this thing
doesn't is there a learning progress
doesn't is there a learning progress
happening
it's kind of weird to
see think I should start looking at the
see think I should start looking at the
end and assuming that there's something
end and assuming that there's something
screwy at
least
least
or
or
or I
or I
should get this running locally
should get this running locally
right yeah I should do that I should get
right yeah I should do that I should get
this running
locally I'll give it another minute
locally I'll give it another minute
before I go down that rabbit
before I go down that rabbit
hole we can take a look at
um a couple things
first I'm trying to see where
first I'm trying to see where
um Nathan post his
um Nathan post his
n that's worth
n that's worth
showing oh there there is more stuff for
showing oh there there is more stuff for
me to reply
me to reply
to what happened
here okay that's nice
oh wait he removed the
oh wait he removed the
gift
gift
what he deleted the
gift what where did it
go he had a really cool environment
graphic I hope he's uh still doing it
graphic I hope he's uh still doing it
why' you delete the graphic man I wanted
why' you delete the graphic man I wanted
to show it off it looks
awesome this is the Moa and it's latest
awesome this is the Moa and it's latest
form we'll work on that in a bit but
form we'll work on that in a bit but
let's look at GPU
drive it's not looking
great I think I'm GNA have to start
great I think I'm GNA have to start
looking through
looking through
for silly potential error so what we'll
for silly potential error so what we'll
do
do
is let me get
okay go back to our local
here and GPU Drive
what we're going to do is we are going
what we're going to do is we are going
to
to
grab from
grab from
puffer and grab our Fork of
it I really don't know if I should have
it I really don't know if I should have
made puffer tank a separate repo cuz
made puffer tank a separate repo cuz
like people don't know it
like people don't know it
exists I've been tempted to just merge
exists I've been tempted to just merge
it all into puffer uh puffer Li but like
we'll
see I guess it's nice that you can just
see I guess it's nice that you can just
clone it on its own because it's like a
clone it on its own because it's like a
machine setup
thing yeah I think I leave it as is I
thing yeah I think I leave it as is I
think I did it
think I did it
right so what I'm looking for here is
right so what I'm looking for here is
the this right here this setup
just paste this
in see how that does
well I don't know if you saw this Nathan
well I don't know if you saw this Nathan
but it popped up the other day that
but it popped up the other day that
um dopus after like 15 years they're
um dopus after like 15 years they're
actually adding like a new big Unity
actually adding like a new big Unity
client so timing wise having an end like
client so timing wise having an end like
that in RL is probably a pretty cool
that in RL is probably a pretty cool
idea you'll probably get some people
idea you'll probably get some people
looking at
it uh what happened
here oh I have to just type this
here oh I have to just type this
manually don't I
wait subm
module the heck
I want to pull up the local render
I want to pull up the local render
basically now to see what the heck is
basically now to see what the heck is
happening with these cars
yeah I thought in beta mhm
I did realize there's going to be one
I did realize there's going to be one
mildly difficult thing um
mildly difficult thing um
so turn-based Ms are slightly ever so
so turn-based Ms are slightly ever so
slightly annoying in reinforcement
slightly annoying in reinforcement
learning just
learning just
slightly uh and the reason for that is
slightly uh and the reason for that is
that like you don't get all of the
that like you don't get all of the
observations and can't make all the
observations and can't make all the
actions for every
actions for every
agent at every time step so you have to
agent at every time step so you have to
do masking and
do masking and
stuff which is what I'm doing right here
stuff which is what I'm doing right here
for GPU drive so it's basically the same
for GPU drive so it's basically the same
thing as having a variable number of
thing as having a variable number of
Agents it is slightly inefficient I
Agents it is slightly inefficient I
think we'll still be able to make it
think we'll still be able to make it
super fast uh but I don't know you know
super fast uh but I don't know you know
we'll see how big the environment ends
we'll see how big the environment ends
up being I might even use this as an
up being I might even use this as an
excuse to like really make turn-based M
excuse to like really make turn-based M
super good and Puffer
what is happening with this
oh yeah I was thinking about it don't
oh yeah I was thinking about it don't
worry puffer will make it
work you don't need a no action
action don't suffer use
puffer hey Will what's
puffer hey Will what's
up and auto publish
up and auto publish
them oh it's so funny that Claude wasn't
them oh it's so funny that Claude wasn't
able to figure that one out well here
able to figure that one out well here
I'll show
you same thing for neural MMO right
oops not

how do you prefer to structure your

right
um I have like One landing page that has
um I have like One landing page that has
a bunch of stuff this is like a tutorial
a bunch of stuff this is like a tutorial
on everything and then I have detailed
on everything and then I have detailed
API over

which technically yeah this stuff is
here do recursive autod do yeah um you
here do recursive autod do yeah um you
can do that for larger projects I found
can do that for larger projects I found
it to be kind of useless to do that
it to be kind of useless to do that
because
because
like I mean like I honestly think you've
like I mean like I honestly think you've
got a problem if you're like looking for
got a problem if you're like looking for
API
API
signatures um on like just the dock page
signatures um on like just the dock page
for internal stuff versus just reading
for internal stuff versus just reading
the source code
the source code
so what I do is I just have in the API
so what I do is I just have in the API
rst
I have specific classes this is like
I have specific classes this is like
public
API and then you can see where is
API and then you can see where is
it where's
ocean yeah like specific classes and
ocean yeah like specific classes and
stuff are autod doed like this but I
stuff are autod doed like this but I
only expose like user level stuff to
only expose like user level stuff to
this right if you want to know how like
this right if you want to know how like
some internal thing in puffer works you
some internal thing in puffer works you
open the source because like what's the
open the source because like what's the
point of just having a function header
point of just having a function header
on an internal thing
online
online
likely the more docks your project needs
likely the more docks your project needs
the worse your project
is how it goes
you want your docks to scale sublinearly
you want your docks to scale sublinearly
with project
with project

proc brother what do you need build proc
proc brother what do you need build proc
for bash make Dosh and commit and then

it gets hosted on GitHub

so no not every time I push to Puffer
so no not every time I push to Puffer
what are you nuts you have a stable 1.0
what are you nuts you have a stable 1.0
and then you have a Dev Branch you don't

just rolling release
just rolling release
everything right you have a stable 10 or
everything right you have a stable 10 or
like a stable whatever your version is
like a stable whatever your version is
and then when you do a new release you

update docs and

enough that you got to update like the

there will be default branch and then
there will be default branch and then

push an empty commit as well to

not no I dude I don't even do CI like I

PRS okay let's go look at those real
PRS okay let's go look at those real
quick we still got GPU Drive experiments
quick we still got GPU Drive experiments
running anyways right
yep I'm assuming this is the bug
yep I'm assuming this is the bug
piix puffer maoko
awesome zooming here
what did you port this
to what
huh it's not perform
huh it's not perform
okay I'll just take your word on this
okay I'll just take your word on this
I'm a bit confused but
I'm a bit confused but
okay what do I
care fair enough that ve noise package
care fair enough that ve noise package
was annoying
rip okay and
rip okay and
then this is what I was looking forward
to ran a carb sweep and puffer but when
to ran a carb sweep and puffer but when
I copy the hyper parameters it performs
I copy the hyper parameters it performs
worse than in the
sweep I got somebody reporting that as
sweep I got somebody reporting that as
well on the Discord
for what environment can I
ask build the
wheel
wheel
okay we'll do a little bit of
okay we'll do a little bit of
housekeeping right
now for
God the repo hygiene is so bad I got to
God the repo hygiene is so bad I got to
really it's
really it's
okay onward and
upward if you use carbs is it gives you
upward if you use carbs is it gives you
repeated
repeated

used that
used that
was cuz that's a different problem right
CH so Peter's saying and I had a
CH so Peter's saying and I had a
different report of this in the Discord

earlier

today that um some environments were not

producing using the same train curves as

um The Sweep parameters
um The Sweep parameters
suggest I use breakout because I wanted

to test
carbs breakout should definitely
carbs breakout should definitely
work let's um can you link me the carb
work let's um can you link me the carb
sweep that you
ran because I copied the breakout pams
ran because I copied the breakout pams
and I I believe those are
and I I believe those are
good cuz I did the same thing
I could see that happening for like
I could see that happening for like
Space Invaders or something there are a
Space Invaders or something there are a
few environments that are really
few environments that are really
finicky um breakout should work unless I
finicky um breakout should work unless I

something wait I thought I merged

something to do with spaces or
something we'll have to check
that we'll do all this right now live
that we'll do all this right now live
including GPU Drive

I have to bump the version Don't
I have to bump the version Don't
I or did you already do that
you already did it for me very
nice more attention to detail than I
nice more attention to detail than I
would have
uh
where is this stupid thing
I'm trying to remember where I have my
credentials the heck
oh wait do I not I probably don't have
oh wait do I not I probably don't have
it on this machine
it on this machine
huh I got to go
grab they did all this tofa [ __ ] a

uploaded you can let me know on that um
uploaded you can let me know on that um
I'm pretty darn sure that the scon stuff
I'm pretty darn sure that the scon stuff
messes with things and makes it hard
okay so that's fixed now what was the
okay so that's fixed now what was the
other
thing Joko oh yeah that's the one I
thing Joko oh yeah that's the one I
asked you for I'm quite excited for that
actually PRS
majoko
binding merge to Dev 500
lines wait why
lines wait why
does why' you take Wan B entity
out oh
okay that's
okay that's
fine you put a default you
put oh you just put like a full clean RL
put oh you just put like a full clean RL
script in for the hell of
it does it not work with clean puff
RL or is this just like to test works
RL or is this just like to test works
both all right that's fine
both all right that's fine
[Music]
maoko okay I'm going to warn
maoko okay I'm going to warn
you I'm going to warn you that these are
you I'm going to warn you that these are
trash all right I took these out of
trash all right I took these out of
Atari recently and I got a huge
Atari recently and I got a huge
performance boost so if if you can get
performance boost so if if you can get
around to it at some point if you're
around to it at some point if you're
still doing stuff with majoko I would
still doing stuff with majoko I would
highly suggest figuring out ways to get
highly suggest figuring out ways to get
rid of this like these trash
rid of this like these trash
rappers they're real
bad cool
being
being
conservative puffer's new to the
conservative puffer's new to the
game yeah we're not conservative at all
game yeah we're not conservative at all
with the way we're deving
stuff we move fast and break things and
stuff we move fast and break things and
then we fix them live on stream when we
then we fix them live on stream when we
screw up
what do you mean it doesn't support
separate
oh yeah kind
oh yeah kind
of I mean you can put
in to be be honest I don't think it
in to be be honest I don't think it
makes a
makes a
difference I don't think it makes a
difference
difference
cool
postprocess you do with puffer post
postprocess you do with puffer post
process oh you actually made the
okay I see
solid PR
solid PR
K very
K very
solid and you know what I'm going to
solid and you know what I'm going to
do I should probably not show these so
do I should probably not show these so
I'll go over to here and I'm going to
have we gotten any replies by the way on
have we gotten any replies by the way on
the competition
reviews didn't think we had did we
two replies of them not doing
two replies of them not doing
anything Academia is such a joke
okay carbs is pretty good getting better
okay carbs is pretty good getting better
results
yeah the DNB track like they really
yeah the DNB track like they really
screwed us on that like that was
insane check
figures
ooh yeah I see
wait did you give me the
initial yeah it didn't make longer and
initial yeah it didn't make longer and
longer experiments but now it
does oh this
I don't it doesn't do this for me this
I don't it doesn't do this for me this
is
is
weird though this could be batch
weird though this could be batch
size that's
size that's
weird okay but I will look at this let
weird okay but I will look at this let
me look at this PR because this is
me look at this PR because this is
probably a big thing
probably a big thing
right if carbs is going to be even
right if carbs is going to be even
better after we merge this that's
crazy where's the
crazy where's the
a that's a PR for carbs not
really
where oh
wait in my work we run a seating
wait in my work we run a seating
function
oh mask out
wait can you explain what is go this is
wait can you explain what is go this is
really big actually
really big actually
um It's actually kind of crazy because I
um It's actually kind of crazy because I
got such ridiculously good results
got such ridiculously good results
before this like are we just going to
before this like are we just going to
solve all of
solve all of
RL if this is I mean if that's as big as
RL if this is I mean if that's as big as
a thing as you said like we go rerun 500
a thing as you said like we go rerun 500
experiment uh sweeps on Atari and just
experiment uh sweeps on Atari and just
solve everything
yeah you assume I'm not actually brain
yeah you assume I'm not actually brain
dead though
dead though
Kung uh let me
see observed so
wait remove the samples that are in
wait remove the samples that are in
success and failure observations what
seeding in other places can lead to
seeding in other places can lead to
repeated examples so we need to remove
repeated examples so we need to remove
them
[Music]
[Music]
here Jesus
why I see what this does but do you know
why I see what this does but do you know
why this happens
why this happens
like we set different RNG and it messes
like we set different RNG and it messes
up there like how would it make them
up there like how would it make them
give me repeated
give me repeated
samples I'm
confused go
back no I get the reproduction I I
back no I get the reproduction I I
believe it I'm just asking do you like
believe it I'm just asking do you like
do you know why this
happens like
happens like
why okay we seed which affects their
why okay we seed which affects their
seeding but then why does that give us
seeding but then why does that give us
repeated results
like is this a fix or a Band-Aid
patch repeated
patch repeated
samples and then and carbs initially
samples and then and carbs initially
produces random wait
produces random wait
repeated
samples carbs also samples from the
Pito seeding messes up the
sampling
how I like I I get what you're I
how I like I I get what you're I
understand the the thing that you've
understand the the thing that you've
shown here I don't understand how that
shown here I don't understand how that
happens
right
right
so because usually right
it happened before and it's not I mean
it happened before and it's not I mean
fair
enough I'll tell you what I'll do k
enough I'll tell you what I'll do k
um how
about do you want to run this on box
about do you want to run this on box
zero real quick like run breakout on
zero real quick like run breakout on
like run five like run 500 Breakout
like run five like run 500 Breakout
experiments or something on box
zero and see if we do better there as
zero and see if we do better there as
well I just want to make sure that
well I just want to make sure that
there's that we actually have like
there's that we actually have like
because this is a big this will affect
because this is a big this will affect
every single experiment in
every single experiment in
puffer and I want to make sure that this
puffer and I want to make sure that this
actually is a proper
fix and if it works there what you can
fix and if it works there what you can
do is you can PR this to the puffer fork
do is you can PR this to the puffer fork
in case MB just doesn't do it for a
in case MB just doesn't do it for a
while and then we'll sync that up when
while and then we'll sync that up when
they eventually do it um but you can
they eventually do it um but you can
grab box zero and run Breakout by
grab box zero and run Breakout by
yeah any update on carbs in w
yeah any update on carbs in w
b yeah
b yeah
I Noah something really weird happened
I Noah something really weird happened
with that
with that
so uh I had like three or four guys on
so uh I had like three or four guys on
their team including their CEO messaged
their team including their CEO messaged
me to like set up meetings and stuff
me to like set up meetings and stuff
about it
about it
and then like I had another one of the
and then like I had another one of the
guys I like I was like hey whatever
guys I like I was like hey whatever
happened to these like you guys never
happened to these like you guys never
got back to me and he said oh the team
got back to me and he said oh the team
said that you ghosted them on two
said that you ghosted them on two
meetings which like we never set up a
meetings which like we never set up a
meeting cuz they never
replied and then I sent them I sent them
replied and then I sent them I sent them
like a nice I sent them a nice write up
like a nice I sent them a nice write up
on like well okay if you guys can't like
on like well okay if you guys can't like
I don't know what's wrong but here's a
I don't know what's wrong but here's a
write up on what you guys should do and
write up on what you guys should do and
as far as I've seen they just have not
as far as I've seen they just have not
done it
done it
so I don't know
man got got to go see you
K all right what's uh we should have
K all right what's uh we should have
lots of experiments in GPU Drive done by
lots of experiments in GPU Drive done by
now
right where is this
yeah so
yeah so
definitely we have uh issues here with
definitely we have uh issues here with
GPU drive so we're going to get the
GPU drive so we're going to get the
rendering working
oops wrong
tab yeah this should
tab yeah this should
be nice and
easy
okay let's go back to what we were doing
okay let's go back to what we were doing
here before with GPU
here before with GPU
drive so we
drive so we
did make dhj
we already have it compiled to C++ 11
we already have it compiled to C++ 11
very
nice y
the funny thing with them not doing the
the funny thing with them not doing the
um not giving a native integration with
um not giving a native integration with
cars is it just makes puffer even more
cars is it just makes puffer even more
valuable but like honestly I'd rather
valuable but like honestly I'd rather
have puffer be less valuable and not
have puffer be less valuable and not

okay not compiled with Cuda support fair
okay not compiled with Cuda support fair
enough
what's going on
what's going on
here I just take
here I just take
forever oh yeah yeah we don't want to
forever oh yeah yeah we don't want to
run that oops Yeah we don't want to run
that one world
whoa what is this
I send uh their
I send uh their
lab some
lab some
stuff I don't see
stuff I don't see
cars where are all the
cars where are the cars
right massive road yeah I know something
right massive road yeah I know something
weird that's what I figured that we'd
weird that's what I figured that we'd
just be able to like look at it and
just be able to like look at it and
figure out what's weird with it cuz I
figure out what's weird with it cuz I
see a big road and I don't see cars
so hopefully the uh the GPU Drive folks
so hopefully the uh the GPU Drive folks
will let me know that I'm nuts
here and I uh hopefully I'm hoping that
here and I uh hopefully I'm hoping that
I'll be done on this by like in the next
I'll be done on this by like in the next
hour or so because I really need to edit
hour or so because I really need to edit
this video I'm going to be real mad if I
this video I'm going to be real mad if I
have to spend my Sunday editing this
have to spend my Sunday editing this
darn video to get it out on Monday
oops somebody asked for stream link
Okay so
we have
actions so what happens when we do
this well it's not going to rerender the
this well it's not going to rerender the
frame
apparently okay we have some random data
apparently okay we have some random data
right
we have some other random
data oh I see all the cars now
data oh I see all the cars now
right you can see all the
cars maybe it's just never resetting
yeah this has got to be it that it just
yeah this has got to be it that it just
isn't resetting right
let's take a
let's take a
look like if I just run
this okay they're cars
right and now the cars are all gone and
right and now the cars are all gone and
it doesn't reset
okay the

why the heck did that seg

okay
okay
done zero

here I did I screw something I think I

did like what puffer did they added the
did like what puffer did they added the
star
star

it's funny they did that
can I look for like
can I look for like
done worlds or
something terminals nand num

this you can see here that there are
this you can see here that there are
some
some
cars they're moving
cars they're moving
[Music]
[Music]
around and they stop
we not have
Teck okay
okay so terminal is

wait
what uh I am very very
confused oh because I put this break
confused oh because I put this break
point to high
point to high
up yeah yeah yeah I put this too high
up okay I see what's
wrong for
okay we have
terminal then we have the control agent
mask terminal so now we actually get to
mask terminal so now we actually get to
try this Terminal
try this Terminal
Man viam

oh I
see logic bug
I think this is if
Len let's try this
Len let's try this
guys always always render your
guys always always render your
environment if you're debugging your

environment and you haven't rendered it
environment and you haven't rendered it
you're screwing up if you're spending
you're screwing up if you're spending
time debugging your en and you haven't
time debugging your en and you haven't
bothered rendering it you're messing up
bad look at that we have
bad look at that we have
cars we have
cars we have
cars folks we have achieved liftoff
we've achieved liftoff from
stupid we have achieved liftoff and
stupid whoa whoa whoa whoa
stupid whoa whoa whoa whoa
uh
huh oh right for
okay and now we can
pull
P hatch
and we
and we
have want
have want
B
weeps
carbs okay so this is our carb site from
carbs okay so this is our carb site from
before
before
we can see it was actually getting a
we can see it was actually getting a
little better over time which is funny
little better over time which is funny
because it has very little data to do
because it has very little data to do
that with kind of
that with kind of
impressive and uh now
we literally have one data point
right oh
jeez our poor compute through putut
we're going to have to do a little more
we're going to have to do a little more
work on this because there's something
wrong for sure there's still something
wrong h
all right I'm going to be right back
all right I'm going to be right back
I'll let this run for a bit it's a
I'll let this run for a bit it's a
restroom I'll be right back and we'll go
restroom I'll be right back and we'll go
from there it's only
three
e
e e
why is my camera so freaking framy is
why is my camera so freaking framy is
what I want to
know have I just like destroyed my CPU
know have I just like destroyed my CPU
rendering
rendering
videos should just be GPU encoding
videos should just be GPU encoding
anyways I don't know what's wrong
H interesting
so what's wrong with the um the speed
so what's wrong with the um the speed
here
oh
dope guys let's just uh let's let's just
dope guys let's just uh let's let's just
ignore this one okay
uh let's just let's just ignore uh
let's rename it to GPU
drive all right and let's
drive all right and let's
just let's just kill this and let's just
just let's just kill this and let's just
uh pretend that didn't happen all right
so much better
so much better
right there we
go I thought for a second I'd like
go I thought for a second I'd like
totally messed up and uh the speed was
totally messed up and uh the speed was
just going to be
just going to be
terrible but nope I forgot the debug
terrible but nope I forgot the debug
flag
is this yeah this public
good I think we just hang out for a few
good I think we just hang out for a few
minutes and wait for this to solve
minutes and wait for this to solve
everything and see if we have any bugs
left we do have a few folks on on
left we do have a few folks on on
YouTube and twitch
cool we're going to give this a few
cool we're going to give this a few
minutes to just do some stuff
though
e e
all
all
right is this
thing oh yeah there we
thing oh yeah there we
go so
go so
uh the question is whether this is
uh the question is whether this is
actually going to learn properly
numb finished
agents this should be changing over time
okay no actually this is fine the way I
okay no actually this is fine the way I
have num finished agents it should be
oscillatory V
oscillatory V

Offroad finished agents goal
Offroad finished agents goal
achieved hard to
achieved hard to
say it's hard to say
definitely this is going to need more
definitely this is going to need more
plots can see that there are two more
plots can see that there are two more
here
already it's possible that these are
already it's possible that these are
just crazy hyper parameters
okay this m.n num worlds thing is not
okay this m.n num worlds thing is not
going to factor in because we're
cashing is this better than before
well it's definitely
well it's definitely
now doing something at
least what are our
least what are our
um what are our settings here
batch size is
260k and it varies from
260k and it varies from
302k to
500k I should get rid of this because
500k I should get rid of this because
this is not going to be
sweepable batch
size these are all the pams we would
size these are all the pams we would
want
okay let me think what else this could
be
be
so it resets
correctly are we passing rewards and
correctly are we passing rewards and
stuff let's
stuff let's
see let's just spot check a little
bit OBS and
mask this function is not used we don't
mask this function is not used we don't
need this right
episode mean reward per episode is being
logged live agent mask on reset
live agent
live agent
mask does get
reset so you get the OBS of the agents
reset so you get the OBS of the agents
you're controlling hold on
ah
confusing this is why
confusing this is why
Vari variable numbers of Agents is just
Vari variable numbers of Agents is just
evil in reinforcement learning it really
evil in reinforcement learning it really
is just
evil it makes you do so much additional
evil it makes you do so much additional
indexing and stuff it's very error prone
indexing and stuff it's very error prone
not to mention it's very inefficient
not to mention it's very inefficient
because each of these indices each of
because each of these indices each of
these index operations requires copying
these index operations requires copying
all the
all the
data so we have controlled agent
data so we have controlled agent
mask so we get a buffer containing all
mask so we get a buffer containing all
the agents we
the agents we
control and then we do a mask hold on
control and then we do a mask hold on
how's the mask
how's the mask
work how's mask work you can't be using
work how's mask work you can't be using
this then right mask
agents
for for
we're going to have to go look at this
we're going to have to go look at this
as well I think unless this is magically
learned it's getting better but it's not
learned it's getting better but it's not
getting better fast enough for my
liking for
right I forget you can't train this
right I forget you can't train this
thing locally it's too
big so we have to let the sweep run for
big so we have to let the sweep run for
a little bit I think but I can at least
I can at least do like 16 worlds or
I can at least do like 16 worlds or
whatever
right
yeah
mask so on the first step mask is all
true now it has some falses in it
indices this looks good to me it really
indices this looks good to me it really
looks good to me here
so let's look for some different markers
then I mean I would be very surprised if
then I mean I would be very surprised if
this feature were broken i' this been
this feature were broken i' this been
very heavily
very heavily
tested so
tested so
like what else can we look
like what else can we look
for control density should be one data
for control density should be one data
density okay we have oscillatory data
density okay we have oscillatory data
density
got
got
[Music]
losses nothing crazy
very good train through
very good train through
put eval
put eval
[Music]
train en is still
slow huh
I'm not seeing any
um any like bad
markers what about
performance you know these performance
performance you know these performance
markers look fine to me
[Music]
[Music]
off-road goal
achieved I might have to do some back of
achieved I might have to do some back of
the envelope math
here because bat size is huge
here because bat size is huge
right okay so here's what we're going to
right okay so here's what we're going to
do so I have 512 environments times 64
do so I have 512 environments times 64
agents I have
agents I have
32,000 agents man
and 32,000
agents am I doing this right wait is
agents am I doing this right wait is
this even
async yeah it's not even async right
async yeah it's not even async right
right because we can't do multiple
right because we can't do multiple
copies of the
copies of the
environment if we just made this thing
environment if we just made this thing
async we'd be set wouldn't
we yeah we should just be
we yeah we should just be
set I wonder if the Madrona API has that
I mean even if you have 512k batch
right you should still be able to learn
right you should still be able to learn
something though
right basically what I'm looking at here
right basically what I'm looking at here
is we have these massive massive batch
is we have these massive massive batch
sizes uh which are good for performance
sizes uh which are good for performance
but then
but then
there can be
issues like because the effective
issues like because the effective
Horizon is only a few
Horizon is only a few
steps they didn't even have an lstm to
steps they didn't even have an lstm to
begin with though and it still
worked we doing
worked we doing
here yeah now it's not even getting
here yeah now it's not even getting
[Music]
better I could just leave this but I'm
better I could just leave this but I'm
not confident that it'll actually
not confident that it'll actually
accomplish anything if I do
where the heck is train. bat size in
where the heck is train. bat size in
here why do I not see
that what
uh this doesn't show
train
gamma the hell
what the hell where's my freaking batch
what the hell where's my freaking batch
size parameter
why is this not
showing I genuinely can't
tell I guess it's
tell I guess it's
not batch size dependent is
it so weird
these are
reasonable it's not doing
well something's definitely wrong
well something's definitely wrong
something is definitely
wrong do I just take their default hyper
wrong do I just take their default hyper
parameters and try
them it didn't look like anything crazy
them it didn't look like anything crazy
special
we'll just do
what about num
steps a mini
batches
five learning rate
3 e minus
entropy no entropy that's very
interesting Max grad Norm 0.5 we'll
say what do they do do for batch
say what do they do do for batch
size 50
worlds I'm sure it's
tiny we'll do like this
maybe we'll see what this even does
nothing meaningful
there I'm going to just make sure that
there I'm going to just make sure that
we're not seeing anything good here
yeah I'm not satisfied with this the
yeah I'm not satisfied with this the
fact that they say it's such an easy
task definitely not satisfied with this
task definitely not satisfied with this
so
so
we'll stop this
sweep okay and then what we'll
sweep okay and then what we'll
do we'll do mode
cracker run on
this quite slow
and we'll see what this curve looks
like and interestingly this goes down
like and interestingly this goes down
over
training and now starts to go back
up nope
now it goes back
up hold
on there's definitely some instability
on there's definitely some instability
of some type Happening Here
what happens if I'm just scaling the
what happens if I'm just scaling the
reward
reward
wrong How likely do I think that is
I mean they're still colliding and stuff
I mean they're still colliding and stuff
so I don't think
so I don't think
[Music]
[Music]
so reward curves are definitely
suspicious
suspicious
mhm like look what happened to
this can you see the sweet page
this can you see the sweet page
here welcome back
here welcome back
K let me
see no
see no
workspace unless I'm invited to
workspace unless I'm invited to
this oops
cool
yep on box zero very nice did you
yep on box zero very nice did you
remember to set it to run 500
remember to set it to run 500
experiments instead of 100 if you just
experiments instead of 100 if you just
see like the number of experiments you
see like the number of experiments you
should see like a 100 or 500 or whatever
got to
got to
check mhm
yeah so this should be done
let me try I'm going to try another
let me try I'm going to try another
experiment while
I oops oh this was the right experiment
okay so that should have worked
right seems 500
right seems 500
sounds
good the heck is wrong with
this I
this I
mean do we know the episode length we
mean do we know the episode length we
don't right
Let's
Let's
do let's do a couple
things what do we think about this
things what do we think about this
um max font
um max font
agents um
Worlds world is the only one
Worlds world is the only one
specified he unique
specified he unique
scenes SC
config right
[Music]
[Music]
then I guess we just
then I guess we just
add episode length
they had a Max episode length somewhere
they had a Max episode length somewhere
in a rapper I remember maybe we're not
in a rapper I remember maybe we're not
doing that
first step
in interesting
92 goal
achieved then the reward function
maybe we're not returning stuff
maybe we're not returning stuff
correctly
right yeah all these self
buffers probably something like this
buffers probably something like this
right
observations truncations rewards
observations truncations rewards
right so all you do is you end up
right so all you do is you end up
setting
stuff I bet you this is the
issue yeah this has got to be it right
right
here I bet you this is
wrong for
very sparse on the reward side it is
very sparse on the reward side it is
getting it though which leads me to
getting it though which leads me to
wonder
how
because you return the reward here from
because you return the reward here from
the environment right
wrong carbs
wrong carbs
Branch
Branch
rip no big
deal I'm a little suspicious of
this for
cannot see the sweet page until you
cannot see the sweet page until you
click
click
it wait
really is that a
thing okay
thing okay
that's kind of
funny shape
M's underscore assign
M's underscore assign
buffers
right and this gets
right and this gets
called wait it gets wrapped in a
cereal I'm very confused okay
and then this gets us this gets
called m. buff
equal all
right oh I'm dumb we don't go through
right oh I'm dumb we don't go through
this
where is this
check
check
ends
exceeds back
exceeds back
end
native upper L Vector NATO
okay so you are returning
okay so you are returning
here we are actually doing this
here we are actually doing this
correctly
believe we don't need this
okay so I pre-allocated
yeah so I do this yeah
live agent Mass
let's try something real
quick what
quick what
[Music]
happens could be an off by one right
oh hey guys it's the
oh hey guys it's the
masking it's the freaking masking being
masking it's the freaking masking being
dum
I actually found
that what if I do it this
way we're going to write this in as a
way we're going to write this in as a
uh a solid find
some
bugs we do a little exorcism
bugs we do a little exorcism
we a little bit of
we a little bit of
exorcism
a and we'll go back up to 512 world so
a and we'll go back up to 512 world so
this isn't stupid
slow let me make sure this actually
trains looks like
it oh
it oh
yeah oh yeah
and let me make sure that this makes
and let me make sure that this makes
sense the thing that I just did I should
sense the thing that I just did I should
probably explain the bug because this is
probably explain the bug because this is
the common
the common
gotcha
so yeah I'll just explain it
so yeah I'll just explain it
um
um
when you have an
when you have an
environment where there are variable
environment where there are variable
number of
number of
Agents you have to mask the dead agents
Agents you have to mask the dead agents
out of the observation right cuz you
out of the observation right cuz you
want to train on dead agents that's
want to train on dead agents that's
training on padding that's bad and the
training on padding that's bad and the
way that you know when an agent dies is
way that you know when an agent dies is
that you get a done signal it says done
that you get a done signal it says done
equals true but for a lot of
equals true but for a lot of
environments right you need the reward
environments right you need the reward
on the step that it dies because it
on the step that it dies because it
could be like reward is 0000 Z and then
could be like reward is 0000 Z and then
it can be removed from the environment
it can be removed from the environment
like with reward one if it gets a goal
like with reward one if it gets a goal
and negative one if it hits a wall for
and negative one if it hits a wall for
instance
instance
right um but you can't Ma you can't set
right um but you can't Ma you can't set
the mask to be true there so what you
the mask to be true there so what you
have to do is you return the current
have to do is you return the current
mask and then you update it if you
mask and then you update it if you
update the mask and then return it then
update the mask and then return it then
your masking out the last observation
your masking out the last observation
which you can't do basically your mask
which you can't do basically your mask
has to Trail one step
behind uh why did the goal go back
down the goal just go back down while I
down the goal just go back down while I
was talking
really that could be hyper prms though
crap now I have to figure
crap now I have to figure
out what I
out what I
did hold
on we're very close to solving this
so live then set terminal then s right
live this was how it was before
live this was how it was before
right so you can't do it this
way mask is live agent mask
uh my brain hurts hold on
side by side
this live agent
this live agent
mask of terminals equal to zero
looks right to
me this really not
work e
it's definitely something with
this I'm finished agents
okay this really not
work hold on
First
First
Step mask
is live agent mask is one right so first
is live agent mask is one right so first
step it's all
step it's all
one then you set the terms to
zero why is it this order
oh because of the
shapes so yeah this looks
shapes so yeah this looks
correct oh look it does
correct oh look it does
work
work
right yeah it's just
fincky that's fine
fincky that's fine
mask live agent mask
terminal
perfect five po of
perfect five po of
environments goal achieved um being
environments goal achieved um being
slightly over one is a bit
slightly over one is a bit
weird I'm sure that there's something
weird I'm sure that there's something
with that
maybe I should find that real
quick we'll see if there's uh a little
quick we'll see if there's uh a little
masking that has to be done here or
masking that has to be done here or
something weird right
I think we're close to having this set
this is your info
tensor this is your controlled agent
tensor this is your controlled agent
mask
so I can just
so I can just
do I can just do this
right I can just do this can
I let's see if this prevents it from
I let's see if this prevents it from
going over
1.0 e
what
what
happened shape of mask is not I thought
happened shape of mask is not I thought
I just I thought I just tried
this I thought I just made sure that
this I thought I just made sure that
this
worked for
right let's see what the heck is wrong
right let's see what the heck is wrong
with this
keeps going
[Music]
[Music]
uh what
wait this says World 274 is
done but that doesn't make sense
164 and 5
oh
let's see if this does it I think this
works if this works then we uh I go take
works if this works then we uh I go take
a break I grab a shake I come back and
a break I grab a shake I come back and
edit video and chill for a bit
looks like it's
looks like it's
good we'll track this this will be the
good we'll track this this will be the
last one if this works we start the
last one if this works we start the
sweep and we're
good e
I can't tell if it's just finicky
oh there it
is yeah there we
go solved
is it going to go over one let's
see it's not going over one come
on well hard to say because it just
on well hard to say because it just
stopped but whatever I think we're
stopped but whatever I think we're
good we're
chilling for
what
me make sure that it actually does
me make sure that it actually does
something
oh
yeah I think that uh I am going to go
yeah I think that uh I am going to go
make myself a shake and have this
make myself a shake and have this
environment solve by the time I get back
environment solve by the time I get back
how's that sound I'll be right back few
how's that sound I'll be right back few
minutes now
e
for
e
e
e
e
for
e
for for
for
okay man my camera is crazy framy isn't
okay man my camera is crazy framy isn't
it
it
like that's
like that's
weird we're going to have to do some
weird we're going to have to do some
maintenance but not right now not right
maintenance but not right now not right
now show me some good news
okay
okay these are random hypers so it takes
okay these are random hypers so it takes
a
second yeah you can see that
here so we'll let this run for a
here so we'll let this run for a
bit um I
will I will change the stream title
will I will change the stream title
[Music]
[Music]
and I will start editing on the video a
and I will start editing on the video a
bit while this
bit while this
runs and then once it's done some
runs and then once it's done some
experiments I will later tonight I will
experiments I will later tonight I will
post
post
uh I mean probably in just an hour or
uh I mean probably in just an hour or
whatever right I'll be able to post a
whatever right I'll be able to post a
cool sweep
let's update
titles for
all right there we
all right there we
go
go
so screen
so screen
filter [ __ ]

close
close
cool we'll leave this in the
cool we'll leave this in the
background and I
background and I
will open some stuff
I forget you can't
I forget you can't
open you open Adobe premere from home or
open you open Adobe premere from home or
is it screw up the
is it screw up the
fonts we'll see should
work I should probably tell them I fixed
work I should probably tell them I fixed

the
the
heck what was I doing
like have all sorts of stuff
misaligned there we
go
for e
where is this table
okay do I have stats on
Doom I should probably get stats on Doom
Doom I should probably get stats on Doom
right
yeah let's do that real quick
I just run it on the same
machine e
[ __ ]
what's the
default is
Doom Health Gathering sueme
oops so funny thing I
oops so funny thing I
found um is that there's actually
found um is that there's actually
a 160 by 120 resolution
option in
Doom and if you do
Doom and if you do
that everything is fast
15K frames per
second
90k
100K I think Doom's 100 K steps per
100K I think Doom's 100 K steps per
second environment folks
second environment folks
anything
anything
better looks like
not it's very easy to hit 100K though it
not it's very easy to hit 100K though it
seems like it doesn't go
over hello why does YouTube doesn't show
over hello why does YouTube doesn't show
messages sometimes uh I don't know it's
messages sometimes uh I don't know it's
I haven't done anything to YouTube I
I haven't done anything to YouTube I
think that they have like some weird
think that they have like some weird
spam filters or something like if you
spam filters or something like if you
try to type too many things too fast and
try to type too many things too fast and
I think that they try to Auto filter
I think that they try to Auto filter
links or something
links or something
dumb but if you don't see it on the chat
dumb but if you don't see it on the chat
window right here then it doesn't show
up welcome though
Doom's
100K does that include frame skip
FR
stack looks like
stack looks like
not
probably for
welcome YouTube
folks we actually did get a little bit
folks we actually did get a little bit
of code in today which is nice we will
of code in today which is nice we will
check on those experiment results in a
check on those experiment results in a
little bit later
little bit later
I'm just doing some editing in the
I'm just doing some editing in the
meantime
heck
do you think world
do you think world
models like shown in this paper hold
models like shown in this paper hold
on oh that's the original one yeah
on oh that's the original one yeah
that's David H's original one
right I have I have the blur on for this
right I have I have the blur on for this
screen
screen
uh are worth it if very fast or not the
uh are worth it if very fast or not the
Focus right now so I have a a more
Focus right now so I have a a more
complex answer to that hold
on
on
so I think that it is
so I think that it is
likely that world
likely that world
models in some form to enable a policy
models in some form to enable a policy
to quantify its
to quantify its
uncertainty about its predictions
uncertainty about its predictions
could be
could be
useful
useful
however I what the thing that I don't
however I what the thing that I don't
like about world models is attempting to
like about world models is attempting to
replace the simulator with like a
replace the simulator with like a
hallucinated version of the simulator in
hallucinated version of the simulator in
my mind that seems like a hack in order
my mind that seems like a hack in order
to try to like eek out more uh
to try to like eek out more uh
essentially eek out extra frames out of
essentially eek out extra frames out of
the
the
simulator when the simulator is really
simulator when the simulator is really
slow um and a lot of the environments
slow um and a lot of the environments
that this has been used for and said
that this has been used for and said
like Hey look it's way better with World
like Hey look it's way better with World
models than
models than
without they've been set up completely
without they've been set up completely
wrong like the dreamer paper on uh the
wrong like the dreamer paper on uh the
crafter Benchmark for instance like the
crafter Benchmark for instance like the
crafter end runs so incredibly slowly
crafter end runs so incredibly slowly
it's like unrealistically slow like
it's like unrealistically slow like
nothing should ever be that slow um so
nothing should ever be that slow um so
yeah then it makes sense to cheat out
yeah then it makes sense to cheat out
extra frames some way but I think most
extra frames some way but I think most
of the time you're probably going to
of the time you're probably going to
want World models to just
want World models to just
be there to help you quantify your
be there to help you quantify your
uncertainty not to replace interaction
uncertainty not to replace interaction
with the simulator
with the simulator
itself that's going to be one of the
itself that's going to be one of the
things that we look
things that we look
at in puffer
at in puffer
um I'd say fairly early on once we start
um I'd say fairly early on once we start
doing
doing
algorithms but you know when we actually
algorithms but you know when we actually
go to look at them we're going to be
go to look at them we're going to be
able to do proper science on it we're
able to do proper science on it we're
going to be able to have you know
going to be able to have you know
comprehensive results over night uh with
comprehensive results over night uh with
how fast our simulators are and the
how fast our simulators are and the
comparison is going to be for most
comparison is going to be for most
purposes wall clock not sample
purposes wall clock not sample
efficiency which will shift things quite
efficiency which will shift things quite
a
a
bit so that's a long answer
okay
that hack
that hack
graphic let me turn the AC hold on
I'd like to at least get um most of the
I'd like to at least get um most of the
editing done on this project
editing done on this project
today I got to get a better hardware
today I got to get a better hardware
setup though for uh for stuff you can
setup though for uh for stuff you can
see the camera is skipping now and
see the camera is skipping now and
actually while I was recording I managed
actually while I was recording I managed
it manage to have some camera lag very
it manage to have some camera lag very
seldom but I might have to re-record a
seldom but I might have to re-record a
couple small things we'll see but it's
couple small things we'll see but it's
it's kind of silly
do we have sweep results
yet yeah okay this end is
solved yeah okay yeah we solved I'll
solved yeah okay yeah we solved I'll
show those in a little
show those in a little
bit I'll show those in a little
bit that's funny
for things like self-driving
for things like self-driving
cars it's worth it because real life
cars it's worth it because real life
data is limited and slow to collect I
data is limited and slow to collect I
assume
assume
um yes
um yes
but wait until you hear my upcoming
but wait until you hear my upcoming
video I have thoughts on that and like
video I have thoughts on that and like
yes it's a reasonable thing to care
yes it's a reasonable thing to care
about but I definitely don't think that
about but I definitely don't think that
the majority of RL should be using World
the majority of RL should be using World
models like that there are good reasons
models like that there are good reasons
behind that so wait as soon as this
behind that so wait as soon as this
video is edited and posted which will
video is edited and posted which will
probably be by Monday you'll see this is
probably be by Monday you'll see this is
a much higher produced piece of content
a much higher produced piece of content
as well
the gist of it is
the gist of it is
um it makes it really hard to make any
um it makes it really hard to make any
progress in research when you start
progress in research when you start
doing stuff with World models and slow
doing stuff with World models and slow
down all the experiments so much
holy hell what is it with PE like
holy hell what is it with PE like
researchers and trying to upload
researchers and trying to upload
gigantic gifts on the
websites like stop
it CU got like a Hollywood length
it CU got like a Hollywood length
GI for
uhoh is it my is my CPU just like
uhoh is it my is my CPU just like
burning what the [ __ ] is
happening I don't know why like this
happening I don't know why like this
stuff is so stuttery
yeah it's freaking burning my CPU what
yeah it's freaking burning my CPU what
the
hell that's annoying
oh okay I
oh okay I
see for whatever reason that's weird so
see for whatever reason that's weird so
luckily my footage is not correct
luckily my footage is not correct
corupted but for whatever reason I guess
corupted but for whatever reason I guess
like the GIF encoding is really gross
like the GIF encoding is really gross
and whenever you play a whenever you
and whenever you play a whenever you
like put a gif into a video the preview
like put a gif into a video the preview
just gets all laggy and it just burns
just gets all laggy and it just burns
your CPU trying to like overlay a gift
your CPU trying to like overlay a gift
onto a
video that's weird
yeah that go it takes my CPU from 60
yeah that go it takes my CPU from 60
something Celsius with with all the
something Celsius with with all the
streaming and stuff um all the way up to
streaming and stuff um all the way up to
90 Celsius in like 5 Seconds that's
crazy that's on Max fan curve as
well
for e
I get to put GPU drive into my video
yay you got to give their lab credit
yay you got to give their lab credit
like they're one of the only groups here
like they're one of the only groups here
who did not put a stupidly gigantic GIF
who did not put a stupidly gigantic GIF
2.8 Megs is
reasonable let's go Hey Eugene I'm oh
reasonable let's go Hey Eugene I'm oh
wait I got something for you since
wait I got something for you since
you're watching hold on you'll get to be
you're watching hold on you'll get to be
the first to see this uh I got something
the first to see this uh I got something
for you let me undo the
blur GP puu Drive is
blur GP puu Drive is
solved and uh how fast do you think this
solved and uh how fast do you think this
was let's
see time relative time
see time relative time
process uh so far the best solve time is
process uh so far the best solve time is
48 seconds 48.5 seconds my bad for 9.99
48 seconds 48.5 seconds my bad for 9.99
94 score or goal achieved got to
94 score or goal achieved got to
validate these still
validate these still
but uh this is just the start of carbs
but uh this is just the start of carbs
it's like it can get
it's like it can get
faster what yeah and we can make this
faster what yeah and we can make this
even faster I assume that's minutes no
even faster I assume that's minutes no
no no no no no I told you like this is
no no no no no I told you like this is
what I'm doing with puffer stuff is fast
what I'm doing with puffer stuff is fast
stuff gets easy because you just
stuff gets easy because you just
automate
automate
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
everything we're going to be able to do
everything we're going to be able to do
this with all of GPU drive as well like
this with all of GPU drive as well like
all of your different scenes will be
all of your different scenes will be
like this the only thing that we need in
like this the only thing that we need in
order to make that happen is this is
order to make that happen is this is
that one scene yeah this is okay but let
that one scene yeah this is okay but let
me explain this is one scene just
me explain this is one scene just
because I could only find one scene with
because I could only find one scene with
60 cars in it so I could densely pack
60 cars in it so I could densely pack
the data we make a couple little changes
the data we make a couple little changes
to the way you're storing data and
to the way you're storing data and
assuming that GPU Drive actually does
assuming that GPU Drive actually does
scale linearly with the number of Agents
scale linearly with the number of Agents
right it has good parallelization
right it has good parallelization
internally uh we can do this with
internally uh we can do this with
anything so yeah now there's a
anything so yeah now there's a
possibility I've messed stuff up but I
possibility I've messed stuff up but I
don't think so um I validated this
don't think so um I validated this
pretty extensively I got to load these
pretty extensively I got to load these
up and watch them play but yeah this is
up and watch them play but yeah this is
the the scene that I linked in chat
the the scene that I linked in chat
before it does scale linearly 100% okay
before it does scale linearly 100% okay
so the issue right now and I discussed
so the issue right now and I discussed
this with Daphne earlier today is that
this with Daphne earlier today is that
uh right now you have to pad your
uh right now you have to pad your
environments to a fixed number of agents
environments to a fixed number of agents
and for whatever reason that ends up
and for whatever reason that ends up
making it really slow so if we can if we
making it really slow so if we can if we
can just get the data not padded out of
can just get the data not padded out of
GPU drive itself so like a so
GPU drive itself so like a so
environment one has one agent
environment one has one agent
environment two has five then like that
environment two has five then like that
goes into the first six elements right
goes into the first six elements right
then there's 10 that goes into the next
then there's 10 that goes into the next
10 elements if we can do that then there
10 elements if we can do that then there
shouldn't be any overhead and we should
shouldn't be any overhead and we should
be able to make this go Zoom um yeah
be able to make this go Zoom um yeah
internally they're padding free right so
internally they're padding free right so
if we can actually do that because I
if we can actually do that because I
don't know what happened with that
don't know what happened with that
padding operation but for some reason
padding operation but for some reason
it's it's really slow cuz I undo that
it's it's really slow cuz I undo that
padding operation in pu and it still
padding operation in pu and it still
ends up being slow um yeah and then we
ends up being slow um yeah and then we
can play with a couple other things to
can play with a couple other things to
increase the data density cuz I think we
increase the data density cuz I think we
could make this go even faster like
could make this go even faster like
there's no reason we can't have this
there's no reason we can't have this
training double this speed
training double this speed
even tensor that we're passing out is
even tensor that we're passing out is
padded I
see yeah it's weird it's definitely
see yeah it's weird it's definitely
weird it does seem like it scaled with
weird it does seem like it scaled with
the size of that tensor though not with
the size of that tensor though not with
the number of Agents I could be doing
the number of Agents I could be doing
something weird there though uh but
something weird there though uh but
let's take a look at the train
speed CU I have those as
speed CU I have those as
metrics it's pretty variable as well so
metrics it's pretty variable as well so
you can see that most of these runs are
you can see that most of these runs are
between 160 and this one's crazy this
between 160 and this one's crazy this
one's at like 400k steps per second but
one's at like 400k steps per second but
most of them are between like 160 and
most of them are between like 160 and
260 steps per second on a 4090
you can see all of these different
you can see all of these different
experiments that have been run this is
experiments that have been run this is
just I launched this I don't know 30
just I launched this I don't know 30
minutes ago or
something and you can see all the
something and you can see all the
different
different
parameters so my hope which is what I
parameters so my hope which is what I
want to do for the whole field is I want
want to do for the whole field is I want
to have everything be this fast so that
to have everything be this fast so that
like you have a new idea for an
like you have a new idea for an
experiment you have a new idea for an
experiment you have a new idea for an
algorithm or method you just implement
algorithm or method you just implement
it you run comprehensive experiments in
it you run comprehensive experiments in
like a couple of hours on one GPU and
like a couple of hours on one GPU and
you're set and while I have to do a lot
you're set and while I have to do a lot
of work on other simulators to make them
of work on other simulators to make them
fast enough like we just do a couple
fast enough like we just do a couple
little things on GPU drive and you'll be
little things on GPU drive and you'll be
able to have that at least for all the
able to have that at least for all the
stuff your lab wants to do with
it so yeah I got delayed for for a
it so yeah I got delayed for for a
couple weeks building this I got delayed
couple weeks building this I got delayed
on like fixing up the stuff with the
on like fixing up the stuff with the
binding for uh for puffer but now it
binding for uh for puffer but now it
works now it's super fast and uh there
works now it's super fast and uh there
were just a couple dumb bugs I had to
were just a couple dumb bugs I had to
fix and now we're good
there's a 32 second run that got 0.95 it
there's a 32 second run that got 0.95 it
looks
like oh actually we're down to 44
like oh actually we're down to 44
seconds now I'm looking at it cuz
seconds now I'm looking at it cuz
998 yeah it'll get faster
998 yeah it'll get faster
too it will get even faster because
too it will get even faster because
carbs will find better hypers
I actually got a bug report that I'm not
I actually got a bug report that I'm not
even using carbs as well as I should be
even using carbs as well as I should be
so that should be even way
better let's see has it done any better
better let's see has it done any better
since I started
talking now 44 seconds is where it
talking now 44 seconds is where it
stands it's the best one right
now we'll see how much faster it gets
this is 512 copies of the uh the biggest
this is 512 copies of the uh the biggest
environment I could find which is 60
environment I could find which is 60
agents like 32,000 agents or
something I saw a cute house on Zillow
something I saw a cute house on Zillow
and had to pop
and had to pop
out no
out no
worries no worries I just been I've just
worries no worries I just been I've just
been yapping about uh about metrics
44 seconds is the current best to solve
44 seconds is the current best to solve
it we'll get faster than that
though right there
whoops uh oh where did my experiments go
there we
go I don't quite understand the Slowdown
go I don't quite understand the Slowdown
internally each agent each Sim I'm
internally each agent each Sim I'm
assume has a variable number of Agents
assume has a variable number of Agents
so we need to chitchat with yud Brennan
so we need to chitchat with yud Brennan
yep yeah that would be good
yep yeah that would be good
also
also
um I don't know if there's a way to
um I don't know if there's a way to
unload scenes you can't unload the
unload scenes you can't unload the
entire Madrona Sim right now that's a
entire Madrona Sim right now that's a
bug in madona it crashes Cuda
bug in madona it crashes Cuda
um I definitely suggested doing uh
um I definitely suggested doing uh
running it in sub processes still
running it in sub processes still
doesn't work still crashes Cuda so I'm
doesn't work still crashes Cuda so I'm
caching the environments across
caching the environments across
experiments now so we can't actually
experiments now so we can't actually
ever like remake the environments with
ever like remake the environments with
uh for instance like one thing that I do
uh for instance like one thing that I do
with my other sweeps right is like I
with my other sweeps right is like I
could set uh the N number of Worlds as a
could set uh the N number of Worlds as a
hyper parameter or I could set like the
hyper parameter or I could set like the
number of unique scenes as a hyper
number of unique scenes as a hyper
parameter I don't think we can do that
parameter I don't think we can do that
now so there's going to have to be a
now so there's going to have to be a
little bit of I mean it's a little bit
little bit of I mean it's a little bit
of lower lower level engineering right
of lower lower level engineering right
for this
stuff they will
we need to make a fun internet ml people
we need to make a fun internet ml people
gather.
toown I think I'm terminally online
toown I think I'm terminally online
enough as
enough as
is gather Town gives me Co
is gather Town gives me Co
Vibes need a gather Town replacement
the funny thing about that to me is like
the funny thing about that to me is like
they made a gamified chat room when like
they made a gamified chat room when like
any multiplayer game is already
that rather.
that rather.
clown it's
funny wait is that an actual site
okay no I got you
baited no it's not a real site you're
baited no it's not a real site you're
messing with me
do it find anything faster while I've
do it find anything faster while I've
been shat
in
in
oh uh we're now down to 41 seconds for
oh uh we're now down to 41 seconds for
uh for solving the N down to 41 seconds
seconds I think we should aim for 30 GPU
seconds I think we should aim for 30 GPU
Drive in 30 seconds learn to drive in 30
Drive in 30 seconds learn to drive in 30
seconds that sounds good to
seconds that sounds good to
me I think we can do
it yeah I can't see the other message
it yeah I can't see the other message
you can DM it to
you can DM it to
me I guess i' check the vid I'm worried
me I guess i' check the vid I'm worried
you're somehow deleting all the cars
you're somehow deleting all the cars
learning to drive in 30 seconds is a
learning to drive in 30 seconds is a
great paper title I mean to be fair we
great paper title I mean to be fair we
solve pong in 90 seconds and that thing
solve pong in 90 seconds and that thing
requires pixel OBS
right we can train uh we can check the
right we can train uh we can check the
vid though I'll what I usually do is
vid though I'll what I usually do is
once I finish training these right like
once I finish training these right like
I'll pick one of the good sets of hyper
I'll pick one of the good sets of hyper
prams and I'll train that again from
prams and I'll train that again from
scratch and then I'll download that
scratch and then I'll download that
model right to make sure that it
model right to make sure that it
works and usually you end up getting
works and usually you end up getting
like a little bit lucky with these cuz
like a little bit lucky with these cuz
you know there is runto run variants um
you know there is runto run variants um
but it still ends up being pretty
close I think even if I were deleting
close I think even if I were deleting
all the cars I think the logging should
all the cars I think the logging should
still catch that we would we'd have to
still catch that we would we'd have to
see
see
I don't know I could be dumb but I
I don't know I could be dumb but I
wasn't going to post this until I
wasn't going to post this until I
checked the videos but you happen to
checked the videos but you happen to
jump in and I'm pretty sure it's good
so we've done snake in 30 seconds and
so we've done snake in 30 seconds and
stuff before but that one trains it a
stuff before but that one trains it a
million steps per
second come to think of it I think um
probably we could even do like an MMO in
probably we could even do like an MMO in
that amount of time right if I do
that amount of time right if I do
where's the
where's the
GIF see a roll out this is running on
GIF see a roll out this is running on
the other box so I can run the preview I
the other box so I can run the preview I
can show you what the environment looks
can show you what the environment looks
like but
like but
um
um
on I can show you what the environment
on I can show you what the environment
looks like that we're using at the
least let me make sure I'm not crashing
myself oops actually this should be
one
oops am I on the right
machine you need a script to pull a
machine you need a script to pull a
model from another box I do have a
model from another box I do have a
script oh I'm on the wrong machine here
script oh I'm on the wrong machine here
hold
on well the thing is I don't save I
on well the thing is I don't save I
don't save trained models while you do
don't save trained models while you do
when I do sweeps because if you save
when I do sweeps because if you save
models from sweeps I end up saving
models from sweeps I end up saving
hundreds of model files for every sweep
hundreds of model files for every sweep
um so I save model files on individual
um so I save model files on individual
runs not sweeps so what I do is I run
runs not sweeps so what I do is I run
the sweep I copy the hyper prams from
the sweep I copy the hyper prams from
the best the best one and then I rerun
that okay fine I the thing I can't train
that okay fine I the thing I can't train
it on the local box because it takes too
it on the local box because it takes too
much Cuda memory so I'd have to kill the
much Cuda memory so I'd have to kill the
sweep in order to train on i' have to
sweep in order to train on i' have to
like to kill the sweep in order to train
like to kill the sweep in order to train
that it's not a three line change I run
that it's not a three line change I run
out of Cuda
memory sounds like an excuse I can kill
memory sounds like an excuse I can kill
the sweep if you want you want me to
the sweep if you want you want me to
kill the sweep I can do
that but then we're not going to get 30
that but then we're not going to get 30
seconds until I I'll have to rerun it
seconds until I I'll have to rerun it
later tonight or something um
later tonight or something um
M Creator must be vac native I forgot I
M Creator must be vac native I forgot I
made this new V mode for GPU Drive
made this new V mode for GPU Drive
murder and
murder and
rollouts okay so this is the en that
rollouts okay so this is the en that
we're using this is without the train
we're using this is without the train
policy here so it's the big en
policy here so it's the big en
right don't put me in this box it's fine
right don't put me in this box it's fine
we can kill this weep for now and we'll
we can kill this weep for now and we'll
see I mean I'll rerun it or whatever I
see I mean I'll rerun it or whatever I
can this is still good enough to post to
can this is still good enough to post to
twter
twter
right if it actually works so we'll do
that
okay don't make me Comp US yeah yeah
okay don't make me Comp US yeah yeah
yeah
yeah it's all right we got plenty more
yeah it's all right we got plenty more
runs where this came from honestly this
runs where this came from honestly this
run like it'll get way better I just had
run like it'll get way better I just had
Kung report to me that I'm a dumbass and
Kung report to me that I'm a dumbass and
I apparently uh did made some bugs when
I apparently uh did made some bugs when
I did the carb sweep integration so
I did the carb sweep integration so
apparently should actually be way better
apparently should actually be way better
than this um but you know you win some
than this um but you know you win some
you lose some
you lose some
there let me see
time how's this one this one looks good
time how's this one this one looks good
right some of these are a kind some of
right some of these are a kind some of
these hyper prams end up being a little
these hyper prams end up being a little

just added majoko bindings to puffer as
well entropy I noticed you didn't have
well entropy I noticed you didn't have
have an any entropy coefficient as well
have an any entropy coefficient as well
in uh in training though the one that

that's

and then the value function coefficient

okay this actually found sane hyper

third person oh was just um I was
third person oh was just um I was
actually just messing with doom uh it
actually just messing with doom uh it
turns out that the maintainers of Doom
turns out that the maintainers of Doom
forgot about a rendering option and you
forgot about a rendering option and you
can actually render Doom at 100,000 FPS
can actually render Doom at 100,000 FPS
as well so uh Doom is probably going to
as well so uh Doom is probably going to
come back to RL with puffer in a big way
come back to RL with puffer in a big way
pretty
soon third person wait is there actually
soon third person wait is there actually
a third person mode for rendering

goal achieved 9973 so this
goal achieved 9973 so this
matches let's see if I messed up or
matches let's see if I messed up or
not I'm kind of suspicious too now
not I'm kind of suspicious too now
because these are really good results
because these are really good results
but stranger things have happened
oh it's actually going to be faster as
oh it's actually going to be faster as
well come to think of it isn't
well come to think of it isn't
it let's see so this
is where's
is where's
the okay yeah here's the score
right oh uh okay if this one is correct
right oh uh okay if this one is correct
it's actually under 30 seconds let's see
it's actually under 30 seconds let's see
now I'm suspicious too because this is
now I'm suspicious too because this is
like ridiculously fast I don't know
like ridiculously fast I don't know
maybe the task is super easy is the task
maybe the task is super easy is the task
just
easy I can't be cancelled
task is easy it's drive straight for the
task is easy it's drive straight for the
senior pick well then yeah it should be
senior pick well then yeah it should be
easy to solve
right I think it's way faster than 30
right I think it's way faster than 30
seconds actually because I have it fixed
seconds actually because I have it fixed
to 10 m steps train for this sweep um
to 10 m steps train for this sweep um
and it looks like it solves it way

faster than

some
some
fixing uh what I will just do for now is
fixing uh what I will just do for now is
so that we can get this done is I will
so that we can get this done is I will
do
do
this no it's not that it messes with it
this no it's not that it messes with it
it's that you have to mess with with the
it's that you have to mess with with the

directory in order to make it work cuz
it doesn't work
it doesn't work
globally I have to mess with the
globally I have to mess with the

directory in order to make it work
because it doesn't it doesn't load
because it doesn't it doesn't load
globally like you can't load GPU drive
globally like you can't load GPU drive
from anywhere with the way it pip
installs I mean I will still say like
installs I mean I will still say like
compared to other environments I mess
compared to other environments I mess
with like it was still fairly easy to
with like it was still fairly easy to
get working so it's not it's not like
get working so it's not it's not like
bad or anything
okay let's see if this does
it oh yeah see it works perfectly
it oh yeah see it works perfectly
doesn't it

pink red car goes to
Red I don't know what's supposed to go
Red I don't know what's supposed to go
over to these ones oh yeah they start
over to these ones oh yeah they start
right next to
it looks really good so now here's the
it looks really good so now here's the
real kicker right now is when I tell you
real kicker right now is when I tell you
how fast this traes and you're not going
how fast this traes and you're not going
to believe
this so GPU drive right here's the thing
this so GPU drive right here's the thing
normally I will sweep the uh the
normally I will sweep the uh the
duration of the experiment but there are
duration of the experiment but there are
a couple Jank things that we're trying
a couple Jank things that we're trying
to fix with carbs to make it a little
to fix with carbs to make it a little
better at the moment so I turned that
better at the moment so I turned that
off for a little bit so this one this
off for a little bit so this one this
experiment trains at looks like over
experiment trains at looks like over
250k steps per second
and let me turn the smoothing
off goal achieved is capped in 3.5
off goal achieved is capped in 3.5
million and if I change this axis from
million and if I change this axis from
steps to process
time less than 30 seconds
solved I don't even know how it
solved I don't even know how it
is oh yeah cuz this at the end here this
is oh yeah cuz this at the end here this
uh yeah yeah
okay but yeah less than 30 seconds so
okay but yeah less than 30 seconds so
28.5 seconds it says
solving uh driving in 30
seconds posted that in the
slack I'll give you the figure
and you guys also can have the sweep
and you guys also can have the sweep
link as
well we could try to make it
well we could try to make it
faster we should work on picking the
faster we should work on picking the
agent if this that's yeah it that's what
agent if this that's yeah it that's what
I try to say that's what I'm saying yeah
I try to say that's what I'm saying yeah
for
for
sure it already
sure it already
is yeah but it'll be way cooler if like
is yeah but it'll be way cooler if like
I think that if you actually got it to
I think that if you actually got it to
the point where uh you can load any
the point where uh you can load any
combination of scenes like this you
combination of scenes like this you
could have one policy solve all the
could have one policy solve all the
scenes simultaneously oh uh also I this
scenes simultaneously oh uh also I this
is not the same policy that you have by
is not the same policy that you have by
default I made the policy a little
default I made the policy a little
simpler um and it still works I'll show
simpler um and it still works I'll show
you that so here let me give you the
you that so here let me give you the
link I
link I
think let me see I think that this link
think let me see I think that this link
works one agent yeah so I'll show you
works one agent yeah so I'll show you
the the policy real
the the policy real
quick I think you'll like this I did add
quick I think you'll like this I did add
an lstm to it just I don't even know if
an lstm to it just I don't even know if
you need one I just add lstms to
you need one I just add lstms to
everything by default CU you can with
everything by default CU you can with
puffer uh 90 lines so I stole your
puffer uh 90 lines so I stole your
unpack function and then I simplified I
unpack function and then I simplified I
took out all the layer norms and stuff
took out all the layer norms and stuff
so it's just uh linear reu linear for
so it's just uh linear reu linear for
ego partner and road map in beds a
ego partner and road map in beds a
project actor and a value function and
project actor and a value function and
then i s which an lstm in the
then i s which an lstm in the
middle so there's the whole
policy this
policy this
is also all available in puffer uh it's
is also all available in puffer uh it's
set up in the docker for you as well so
set up in the docker for you as well so
it has puffer all set up like this with
it has puffer all set up like this with
GPU Drive in the uh the image does it
GPU Drive in the uh the image does it
still have its permutation in variance
still have its permutation in variance
uh it should let me
see torch. cat yeah it does because we
see torch. cat yeah it does because we
do the Maxes here
right we avoided an lstm because you
right we avoided an lstm because you
know so this is how easy an lstm is in
puffer this is how easy the lstm is in
puffer this is how easy the lstm is in
puffer uh what we do
is I'll show
is I'll show
you this is one of the things that uh we
you this is one of the things that uh we
do to try to make your life a little
easier so the hard thing about getting
easier so the hard thing about getting
an lstm right is there's this really
an lstm right is there's this really
obnoxious transpose and if you mess it
obnoxious transpose and if you mess it
up like everything breaks so what you do
up like everything breaks so what you do
is you just give your policy to the lstm
is you just give your policy to the lstm
and then we do a whole bunch of asserts
and then we do a whole bunch of asserts
here to make sure you're not screwing
here to make sure you're not screwing
anything else up and we do the
anything else up and we do the
transposes and stuff for you so you do
transposes and stuff for you so you do
encode all the transposes and stuff the
encode all the transposes and stuff the
recurrent cell transposes and then
recurrent cell transposes and then
decode so I just put like everything
decode so I just put like everything
before lstm into end code everything
before lstm into end code everything
after into dcode and it works
got to figure out how to
got to figure out how to
replace all The Pedestrian viz with this
replace all The Pedestrian viz with this

um you were looking at blender stuff
um you were looking at blender stuff
um yeah that a cool like a cool renderer

oh and then this has a transition yep
oops snake
do I not have a gift of the snake

do make collab
mm
there we
go for
2 a.m. good luck thank you for dropping
2 a.m. good luck thank you for dropping
by
there's so much work so much work and
there's so much work so much work and
stuff to
do get some
sleep everybody's got gifts on their
homepage for
why the hell is it that fast what the
why the hell is it that fast what the
heck is wrong with these
people they actually made it like one
people they actually made it like one
state update
we not have any good gifts of this
I thought I had like a for
Jen GI or
something
e
e e
where's the Moa for
that's really gross you literally can't
that's really gross you literally can't
rename stuff
got
got
to reopen the stupid premere Pro
app for
1 million steps per second is 200,000
1 million steps per second is 200,000
times real
times real
time's
that is that right
that is that right
200,000 five ticks per
200,000 five ticks per
second that's 55
Powers yesh what the heck
I don't want to have
uh for
apparently we're simulating 55 hours per
apparently we're simulating 55 hours per
second per core is that right
second per core is that right
wait that has to be right doesn't
wait that has to be right doesn't
it
it
because 1 million
because 1 million
right divide by five because they're
right divide by five because they're
five ticks per second divide by 3600

for e
that

okay it's
heck for
hey how's it
going I am dying of video editing here
going I am dying of video editing here
let me tell
you absolutely dying of video editing
you absolutely dying of video editing
good to see you around though that's
good to see you around though that's
where I've been the hope is that I
where I've been the hope is that I
finish this bloody thing either today or
finish this bloody thing either today or
Sunday so I can just be back to full Dev
Sunday so I can just be back to full Dev
next week because I'm sick of
next week because I'm sick of

and yeah the oh I did
post this one is more technical the new
post this one is more technical the new
video I'll be posting soon is way more

drugs in there I'm
sure okay I really like these actually
sure okay I really like these actually
the more I look at the these I actually
the more I look at the these I actually
really like these I think a couple of
really like these I think a couple of
the timings are a bit off
I like isn't this one here like too
I like isn't this one here like too
fast like you can't even see the middle
frame and the middle frame is really
frame and the middle frame is really
ridiculous because you can see it's like
ridiculous because you can see it's like
the fish head
I think usually the attack animation is
I think usually the attack animation is
like the most important thing because
like the most important thing because
that's the thing that you use a

uh let me
think it seems like way too slow right
think it seems like way too slow right
it's like the death animations on stuff
it's like the death animations on stuff
like this sometimes you actually they
like this sometimes you actually they
slow the death animations down right so
slow the death animations down right so
you can literally see like du or
you can literally see like du or
whatever
I don't know but regardless like you
I don't know but regardless like you
have the you have them it's just a
have the you have them it's just a
matter of like how many times things are
matter of like how many times things are
repeated these are solid I like
repeated these are solid I like
them I have to do is nice Sprite sheet
them I have to do is nice Sprite sheet
system for you I'll put in a lot of good
system for you I'll put in a lot of good
work on the uh the code tomorrow so
work on the uh the code tomorrow so
hopefully it'll start being easier to
hopefully it'll start being easier to
integrate stuff and then next week we'll
integrate stuff and then next week we'll
be able to really
be able to really
start I think you're getting stuck here
start I think you're getting stuck here
right you're getting stuck against the
right you're getting stuck against the
edge of the border right
edge of the border right
here cuz the tip of the sword is
here cuz the tip of the sword is
gone I think you're getting stuck
gone I think you're getting stuck
against like the edge of the
graphic I can't tell if it's in the
graphic I can't tell if it's in the
source or
not these are I just realized these are
not these are I just realized these are
going to look so much better as well
going to look so much better as well
when I get the actual source files or
when I get the actual source files or
like I get like the actual upscaled
like I get like the actual upscaled
versions that's not the stupid Discord
versions that's not the stupid Discord
version wait can I open this in the
version wait can I open this in the
browser and like does this give me
browser and like does this give me
better
upscaling nah it still upscales it
bad but I can tell it's going to be
bad but I can tell it's going to be
something pretty
cool that's awesome that is awesome
I like the
artwork BX yeah oh actually I can give
artwork BX yeah oh actually I can give
you a great example of the type of thing
you a great example of the type of thing
that I hate though I don't think you
that I hate though I don't think you
were going there in the first
place the way that these guys do all
place the way that these guys do all
their
their
logos they actually do a bunch of really
logos they actually do a bunch of really
good work for the field
good work for the field
but
like I do not like this type of thing
whatsoever there you go so not
this Sprite a day makes the coding okay
this Sprite a day makes the coding okay
very
true God it feels snoody yeah yeah yeah
true God it feels snoody yeah yeah yeah
right it's
right it's
like
like
ah it's like look I'm the least fun
ah it's like look I'm the least fun
person I know and that bores the hell

out of me I'm like the most boring
out of me I'm like the most boring

initially I don't think you have to like
initially I don't think you have to like
go too crazy with like the number of
go too crazy with like the number of
different animations per character

initially because then if you want to
initially because then if you want to
tweak the character at all it gets to be
tweak the character at all it gets to be
way harder right
um okay I have something for you so you

creeps are still the
creeps are still the
puffers you can replace those as well if
puffers you can replace those as well if
you want but I think that there should

though there's no currency at the
though there's no currency at the
moment is the thing right
I don't know I kind of realized
I don't know I kind of realized
something that like eventually I
something that like eventually I
probably don't have to care about this
probably don't have to care about this
now but actually here I don't have to
now but actually here I don't have to
pull it up on the screen because you
pull it up on the screen because you
have it on the puffer fish up uh up
have it on the puffer fish up uh up
there like eventually I'm going to get
there like eventually I'm going to get
trouble for doing the thing I'm going to
trouble for doing the thing I'm going to
get in trouble for doing the thing where
get in trouble for doing the thing where
like I add more logos to feed the puffer
like I add more logos to feed the puffer
or
or
whatever So eventually like somebody's
whatever So eventually like somebody's
going to get mad and I'll say screw it
going to get mad and I'll say screw it
and I'll just have the puffer inhale a
and I'll just have the puffer inhale a
bunch of stars or something instead but
bunch of stars or something instead but
yeah star the like I I think I'm going
yeah star the like I I think I'm going
to make it a thing like yeah the puffer
to make it a thing like yeah the puffer
eat Stars feed the puffer more stars
eat Stars feed the puffer more stars

I miss like all the
I miss like all the
cool game AI stuff that happened in like
cool game AI stuff that happened in like
2019 the open ai5 stuff was the
2019 the open ai5 stuff was the
coolest I still remember when I was like
coolest I still remember when I was like
there late one evening developing neural
there late one evening developing neural
MMO and like they were doing some early
MMO and like they were doing some early
like employee tests or whatever where
like employee tests or whatever where
they were trying to play the bot to see
they were trying to play the bot to see
like how good it was and uh Alec Radford
like how good it was and uh Alec Radford
who is the GPT guy I think he was just
who is the GPT guy I think he was just
one of the best DOTA players like that
one of the best DOTA players like that
they had as an employee so he would like
they had as an employee so he would like
lead and shot call the uh the matches
lead and shot call the uh the matches
versus the bot so I'd be there
versus the bot so I'd be there
developing neurl MMO and I'd hear like
developing neurl MMO and I'd hear like
across the office you know cuz open
across the office you know cuz open
Office like a dive CM for an extra kill
Office like a dive CM for an extra kill
it's like okay
it's like okay
[Laughter]
good fun times for
wish I could have gotten into DOTA
wish I could have gotten into DOTA
League lasting pissed me off resetting
League lasting pissed me off resetting
progress yeah that's why I played
progress yeah that's why I played
MMOs that's why I played the
MMOs that's why I played the
MMOs right
also just like mechanically it's like
also just like mechanically it's like
you can't keep up with the freaking kids
you can't keep up with the freaking kids
that are no life in those games
what's your
what's your
temperature on a coral or an En me to oh
temperature on a coral or an En me to oh
my gosh I don't know why I didn't think
my gosh I don't know why I didn't think
of that that's an awesome
of that that's an awesome
idea like a
idea like a
reef so the one thing that you have to
reef so the one thing that you have to
decide
decide
on uh is you need to figure out
on uh is you need to figure out
the
perspective you could just make it like
perspective you could just make it like
a typical like an older game where like
a typical like an older game where like
the perspective doesn't make any sense
the perspective doesn't make any sense
and it's
and it's
like cuz right now like you're looking
like cuz right now like you're looking
at the screen and like it's the like you
at the screen and like it's the like you
can see straight on so it's like a side
can see straight on so it's like a side
view but then the background isn't a
view but then the background isn't a
side view so
like like the towers would be like on
like like the towers would be like on
the bottom of the tank or something then
the bottom of the tank or something then
it wouldn't make sense so yeah I think
it wouldn't make sense so yeah I think
that you can just like put like a coral
that you can just like put like a coral
Tower type thing that'd be awesome like
Tower type thing that'd be awesome like
a
reef you only need to make uh
reef you only need to make uh
I think initially you only need to make
I think initially you only need to make
one of one of them and then just make it
one of one of them and then just make it
so that like we can retint like if
so that like we can retint like if
there's like let's say that there's like
there's like let's say that there's like
a base and then there like some coral
a base and then there like some coral
pieces on top or something like make it
pieces on top or something like make it
so that we can retint to swap the side
so that we can retint to swap the side
from like dire to
from like dire to
radiant would that make sense that way
radiant would that make sense that way
you only have to make one graphic like
you only have to make one graphic like
you know cuz they're two different sides
you know cuz they're two different sides
so we can just like retint like whatever
so we can just like retint like whatever
the accent is
the accent is
like to like from like uh cyan to red or
like to like from like uh cyan to red or
whatever so that we have like the
whatever so that we have like the
radiant and the dire
Side Oh by saying by what you're saying
Side Oh by saying by what you're saying
like that you never got into them but
like that you never got into them but
you know about like last hitting and
you know about like last hitting and
reset like last hits and stuff I assume
reset like last hits and stuff I assume
that you actually like know something
that you actually like know something
about the games then then you can Pro if
about the games then then you can Pro if
you do you can probably appreciate like
you do you can probably appreciate like
how crazy complicated
how crazy complicated
it is to be able to solve something like
it is to be able to solve something like
DOTA with reinforcement learning and how
DOTA with reinforcement learning and how
powerful the tech is like what that says
powerful the tech is like what that says
about the tech
about the tech
right like I don't think if you explain
right like I don't think if you explain
DOTA to most adults yeah very Jame game
DOTA to most adults yeah very Jame game
genre sound right yeah I would like if
genre sound right yeah I would like if
you explain DOTA to most adults I don't
you explain DOTA to most adults I don't
think that they would believe you that
think that they would believe you that
like typical people have a hobby that is
like typical people have a hobby that is
that insanely complicated
that insanely complicated
right like just think about the stuff in
right like just think about the stuff in
that game like how the hell does anybody
that game like how the hell does anybody
play that right is what you would
get no it's [ __ ] nuts how many Heroes
get no it's [ __ ] nuts how many Heroes
League with all the builds
League with all the builds
yeah
yeah they keep making it more and more
yeah they keep making it more and more
complicated as well which is the crazy
complicated as well which is the crazy
thing by adding more and more so it just
thing by adding more and more so it just
gets harder and harder to get into that
gets harder and harder to get into that
game
I actually pitched Riot on like some RL
I actually pitched Riot on like some RL
stuff with puffer a while ago they
stuff with puffer a while ago they
didn't go for it I have a good pitch but
didn't go for it I have a good pitch but
yeah let just let me appreciate fiddles
yeah let just let me appreciate fiddles
stick's character design and everything
stick's character design and everything
else is right
out I think character design wise my
out I think character design wise my
favorite has got to be Tren deir he's
favorite has got to be Tren deir he's
like a jacked Barbarian who's literally
like a jacked Barbarian who's literally
too angry to die
be like
trendir
right too angry to die is a top 10
right too angry to die is a top 10
Niche you're pretty good
Niche you're pretty good
it's pretty freaking
funny it's pretty
funny it's pretty
funny I actually think I like a lot of
funny I actually think I like a lot of
the DOTA character designs better though
the DOTA character designs better though
than the league
than the league
ones well some of the ones are pretty
good I remember I liked playing uh L in
good I remember I liked playing uh L in
League cuz he's just like her voice
League cuz he's just like her voice
lines are like all just obnoxiously
lines are like all just obnoxiously
optimistic
Rook I really liked Lena's character
design they have a lot of classic ones
design they have a lot of classic ones
like Lena and CM and then like V with
like Lena and CM and then like V with
the giant ass sword and
the giant ass sword and
like they a lot of good ones
too angry to die is like so
funny
for
for
e e
Nuclear
Nuclear
Throne let me look at that in a
second e
Nuclear
Throne
Throne
woh what's this
what is
this
uh so the way that the artwork is done
uh so the way that the artwork is done
is fine but the characters are way too
is fine but the characters are way too
zany in the in the uh the character like
zany in the in the uh the character like
designs are like way too zany for me oh
designs are like way too zany for me oh
the game looks completely
different yeah yeah okay the perspective
yeah it's like top down but not really I
yeah it's like top down but not really I
see what you mean yeah
hey
welcome to the Blurred
stream but are we cooking here
we might be cooking here
h
I have
now
for
for
for
e
e e
pretty much just uh hanging out chatting
pretty much just uh hanging out chatting
here for the next I don't know
here for the next I don't know
hourish while I finish
hourish while I finish
editing and that's pretty much the plan
unresponsive because I'm thumbnailing
unresponsive because I'm thumbnailing
Towers hey that's a good use of
Towers hey that's a good use of
time I'm just editing videos and trying
time I'm just editing videos and trying
to figure out how much stuff to cut in
to figure out how much stuff to cut in
between for promos and all that stuff
thumbnailing I know what it means to be
thumbnailing I know what it means to be
thumbnailing a tower
I'm actually getting to
I'm actually getting to
be okay enough with the video
editing
for
for e
the hardest
the hardest
part is making the tower not look like a
part is making the tower not look like a
bucket of freaking french
fries I don't know poal
oh you're using like I see you're using
oh you're using like I see you're using
like a weird image probably let me
think you could just do like a basic
think you could just do like a basic
Tower shape that sort of lower Fidelity
Tower shape that sort of lower Fidelity
and then have like some Coral sticking
and then have like some Coral sticking
out of it I don't
out of it I don't
know yeah if you do like the like the
know yeah if you do like the like the
tubular looking ones it's going to look
tubular looking ones it's going to look
like fries of course for
sand castles oh yeah that would work too
sand castles oh yeah that would work too
they'd be underwater but yeah that's
they'd be underwater but yeah that's
fine oh actually there is totally
a let me link you a Wiki page that has
a let me link you a Wiki page that has
some silly things in
it there's literally a dopest dungeon
it there's literally a dopest dungeon
that's set in the freaking sand
that's set in the freaking sand
castle and has like a bunch of corals
castle and has like a bunch of corals
and
stuff oh I forgot to tell you okay this
stuff oh I forgot to tell you okay this
is not going to work for this cuz it's
is not going to work for this cuz it's
like mixed inspiration but I can show
like mixed inspiration but I can show
you like one of my favorite designed
you like one of my favorite designed
places in a
game I should put put this in the uh the
Discord is there artwork in
here there's not enough artwork in
here there's not enough artwork in
it oh yeah there's a gallery at the
it oh yeah there's a gallery at the
bottom that you can see
that is a sick map yeah man there are
that is a sick map yeah man there are
like a couple games I've
like a couple games I've
played here I'll also link you the
played here I'll also link you the
chambers old school RuneScape has this
chambers old school RuneScape has this
really sweet raid that's set in this
really sweet raid that's set in this
like Crystal
Cave but yeah like basically all of that
Cave but yeah like basically all of that
game looks like that it's pretty cool
game looks like that it's pretty cool
right for like a freaking super old
right for like a freaking super old
Flash
Flash
game I'm trying to think of like some of
game I'm trying to think of like some of
the other ones that look really cool in
the other ones that look really cool in
that game
game what are like some iconic
game what are like some iconic
ones Chambers is
ones Chambers is
Eric yeah that's that's uh I just
Eric yeah that's that's uh I just
thought of it as like another thing that
thought of it as like another thing that
I thought looked cool I don't think it
I thought looked cool I don't think it
works for this because it's like
works for this because it's like
crystals it's not like
aquatic what other maps are there I'm
aquatic what other maps are there I'm
trying to think of like the dopest
trying to think of like the dopest
Maps if there's anything cool
there's actually a lot of them now that
there's actually a lot of them now that
I think of it I don't even know which
I think of it I don't even know which
one to
pick I know I won't force it right like
pick I know I won't force it right like
I just thought of that one because like
I just thought of that one because like
oh yeah sand castle oh yeah there's
oh yeah sand castle oh yeah there's
totally a sand castle right here's your
totally a sand castle right here's your
sand
castle for
I know a lot of like the artwork in MMOs
I know a lot of like the artwork in MMOs
just ends up being really cool because
just ends up being really cool because
like they'll design one piece of content
like they'll design one piece of content
in like a year because they know that
in like a year because they know that
people are going to do it a thousand
people are going to do it a thousand
times
so they'll be like shoot we better make
so they'll be like shoot we better make
sure the artwork at least looks good if
sure the artwork at least looks good if
we're going to literally design one
we're going to literally design one
thing all year
you're free to like look around those
you're free to like look around those
wikis MMO content pipeline is so slow
wikis MMO content pipeline is so slow
so because I can tell you what happens
so because I can tell you what happens
when it's not slow is you [ __ ] up the
when it's not slow is you [ __ ] up the
entire economy of the
entire economy of the
game like the balance
game like the balance
around the balance around like what
around the balance around like what
comes out of the content and
comes out of the content and
like yeah the balance of what comes out
like yeah the balance of what comes out
of it really important and like you want
of it really important and like you want
it to be like really rewarding on
it to be like really rewarding on
release
um but then the thing like if it's not
um but then the thing like if it's not
rewarding enough on release it's lame
rewarding enough on release it's lame
and then like it's lame to have to buff
and then like it's lame to have to buff
it after it's released but if it's too
it after it's released but if it's too
good on release then you just destroy
good on release then you just destroy
the entire economy of the whole
game like RuneScape did this they
game like RuneScape did this they
released like one relatively boring boss
released like one relatively boring boss
and I think it still might be the best
and I think it still might be the best
money in the entire game because it like
money in the entire game because it like
it drops the best armor and like nobody
it drops the best armor and like nobody
wants to do it but like it's like twice
wants to do it but like it's like twice
as much money as anything else in the
as much money as anything else in the
game because everybody needs a set of it
game because everybody needs a set of it
oops we probably should have made it
oops we probably should have made it
have like one piece of that armor and
have like one piece of that armor and
have it be more common and have spread
have it be more common and have spread
the other ones out across the rest of
the other ones out across the rest of
the game but oops it's too late now and
the game but oops it's too late now and
now we're screwed right it's like that
now we're screwed right it's like that
type of a thing
or they've done the opposite as well
or they've done the opposite as well
where it's like oops we released this
where it's like oops we released this
really cool boss that everybody likes
really cool boss that everybody likes
but we made the rewards not good enough
but we made the rewards not good enough
and uh now nobody's ever going to do
and uh now nobody's ever going to do
it botting make it a core
it botting make it a core
mechanic I mean the endgame content
mechanic I mean the endgame content
though like you're not botting the
though like you're not botting the
endgame content there are gold Farmers a
endgame content there are gold Farmers a
few of them that can do it but like yeah
I will tell you that the gold farming
I will tell you that the gold farming
actually completely it will actually
actually completely it will actually
completely destroy a game is the problem
completely destroy a game is the problem
like okay cool they're cheap resources
like okay cool they're cheap resources
right but like they're all they're not
right but like they're all they're not
just farming the resources they're also
just farming the resources they're also
farming bosses and stuff and they'll
farming bosses and stuff and they'll
drop the prices of the things that come
drop the prices of the things that come
from the bosses so much that it's
from the bosses so much that it's
literally never worth it for anybody to
literally never worth it for anybody to
do them ever
again which is the silly
thing
for
for for
I should order
I should order
dinner real
dinner real
quick get some food and then I will
quick get some food and then I will
continue working on this until food gets
continue working on this until food gets
here uh we got some decent progress I'd
here uh we got some decent progress I'd
say today
say today
I mean to be fair I didn't get as much
I mean to be fair I didn't get as much
done on the video as I wanted to but I
done on the video as I wanted to but I
literally solved an RL environment today
literally solved an RL environment today
so
huge what's huge oh yeah yeah
huge what's huge oh yeah yeah
yeah I
yeah I
uh I had a
uh I had a
conversation with uh one of the
conversation with uh one of the
researchers on GPU drive it was very
researchers on GPU drive it was very
nice and uh very smart good researcher
nice and uh very smart good researcher
right and uh she said well you know it's
right and uh she said well you know it's
already pretty fast you know we can
already pretty fast you know we can
already run these experiments in like in
already run these experiments in like in
like a couple of hours said okay let me
like a couple of hours said okay let me
work on that and uh like 4 hours later I
work on that and uh like 4 hours later I
sent back like okay I have the thing
sent back like okay I have the thing
training uh it takes 28
seconds yeah it takes 28 seconds now and
seconds yeah it takes 28 seconds now and
uh I had the the pi was the pi for that
uh I had the the pi was the pi for that
who I know right joined the stream and I
who I know right joined the stream and I
said hey I got something to show you let
said hey I got something to show you let
me show you the uh the training graphs
me show you the uh the training graphs
for this you know these experiments I've
for this you know these experiments I've
been running and he thought that the
been running and he thought that the
axis was in minutes and I said no the
axis was in minutes and I said no the
axis is in
seconds no no no the axis is in seconds
seconds no no no the axis is in seconds
what do you take me
what do you take me
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
for so that's fun hopefully that
for so that's fun hopefully that
environment will be like Ultra widely
environment will be like Ultra widely
used now just cuz like it's such a good
used now just cuz like it's such a good
environment just needed like a little
environment just needed like a little
bit more on the perf side
am I stupid for wanting to order from
am I stupid for wanting to order from
Panera Bread of all freaking
places I used to remember the food
places I used to remember the food
quality being so much
higher I really want a chicken soup
nah man I don't need the
nah man I don't need the
calories I've been okay I'm like I'm
calories I've been okay I'm like I'm
pretty much just maintaining at the
moment it's going to take me another
moment it's going to take me another
couple weeks to get back to the really
couple weeks to get back to the really
heavy lifts I mean I did the what's this
heavy lifts I mean I did the what's this
three weeks weeks I think now three
three weeks weeks I think now three
weeks after the
50K for
how do we Implement a how do we
how do we Implement a how do we
Implement a paper as a begin give me one
Implement a paper as a begin give me one
second I'm trying to find myself some
second I'm trying to find myself some
food to order and I will answer some
food to order and I will answer some
questions
just a
just a
second I am being dumb and indecisive at
second I am being dumb and indecisive at
the moment
let's get a
let's get a
pasta some freaking vegetables though
man I don't know
mood let me figure this out I I have
mood let me figure this out I I have
some cool paper tips
but I don't know my brain just stops
but I don't know my brain just stops
working about food at some point it's
working about food at some point it's
just like what how do I
eat I guess the only thing I have that I
eat I guess the only thing I have that I
know works is
actually just do an
omelette yeah that was good
add I don't know why I took that long
add I don't know why I took that long
for
this all right
so it depends if you're talking about an
so it depends if you're talking about an
ml paper or an RL paper um
there's going to be a lot of difference
there's going to be a lot of difference
there
there
so a lot of ml papers tend to be like
so a lot of ml papers tend to be like
architecture heavy and
architecture heavy and
such and the main difficulty is like
such and the main difficulty is like
getting the architecture to be just
getting the architecture to be just
right a lot of RL
right a lot of RL
papers tend to be the train Loop is a
papers tend to be the train Loop is a
lot harder to implement um because you
lot harder to implement um because you
generally have separate train phases you
generally have separate train phases you
maybe have a replay but maybe you have
maybe have a replay but maybe you have
to do generalized Advantage estimation
to do generalized Advantage estimation
there tends to be a lot like multiple
there tends to be a lot like multiple
data State data collection phases uh and
data State data collection phases uh and
the data comes from the simulator as
the data comes from the simulator as
well so you have to work with
well so you have to work with
that
that
uh so I mean I did this when I
started I would suggest picking
started I would suggest picking
something that doesn't take a ton of
something that doesn't take a ton of
compute to
compute to
train because if you're going to pick
train because if you're going to pick
something that you don't have the
something that you don't have the
resources to do properly you'll
resources to do properly you'll
basically have zero way of checking
basically have zero way of checking
whether your implementation is correct
whether your implementation is correct
or
or
not
not
um
yeah that's what I would generally
yeah that's what I would generally
suggest is that's probably the single
suggest is that's probably the single
most important thing
most important thing
honestly I did when I oh also pick a
honestly I did when I oh also pick a
paper that actually makes sense to read
paper that actually makes sense to read
like some papers are just ridiculously
like some papers are just ridiculously
written with way too much math and not
written with way too much math and not
enough details to actually Implement
enough details to actually Implement
properly
I think when I started I did like encode
I think when I started I did like encode
decode
decode
lstms uh for language modeling and I did
lstms uh for language modeling and I did
like uh variational Auto
like uh variational Auto
encoders uh yeah I think those were the
encoders uh yeah I think those were the
two big ones and then basically once
two big ones and then basically once
you've implemented a few papers it's
you've implemented a few papers it's
like congratulations now it's time to do
like congratulations now it's time to do
your own
research I'm trying to think if it's
research I'm trying to think if it's
still worth trying to implement papers
still worth trying to implement papers
these days
I honestly don't know if it's worth
I honestly don't know if it's worth
trying to implement papers these
days I think it's worth trying to
days I think it's worth trying to
implement basic methods but trying to
implement basic methods but trying to
implement full papers
like paper and reinforcement
like paper and reinforcement
learning you should imp like you should
learning you should imp like you should
Implement some for form of reinforcement
Implement some for form of reinforcement
learning train Loop uh when you star in
learning train Loop uh when you star in
reinforcement learning if you're trying
reinforcement learning if you're trying
to take it
to take it
seriously like something as simple as
seriously like something as simple as
dqn or like vanilla policy gradients or
dqn or like vanilla policy gradients or
whatever is
whatever is
fine um there are really good
fine um there are really good
implementations that you can refer to
implementations that you can refer to
nowadays these didn't used to exist but
nowadays these didn't used to exist but
clean RL has some like really good and
clean RL has some like really good and
simple reference
implementations I would generally
implementations I would generally
suggest doing like vanilla policy
suggest doing like vanilla policy
gradients
gradients
honestly do like vanilla policy
honestly do like vanilla policy
gradients on cart Pole or something
gradients on cart Pole or something
basic like
basic like
that that'll be like 200 lines of code
that that'll be like 200 lines of code
there are all sorts of good resources on
there are all sorts of good resources on
it it'll let you understand the anatomy
it it'll let you understand the anatomy
of the train
Loop but the thing is you're not going
Loop but the thing is you're not going
to get like a super cool result out of
to get like a super cool result out of
it right you're just going to get
it right you're just going to get
something
basic now if you're looking to get more
basic now if you're looking to get more
into like The Cutting Edge of RL but
into like The Cutting Edge of RL but
you're not looking to get into the side
you're not looking to get into the side
where you need tons and tons of
where you need tons and tons of
algorithmic knowledge I we have tons of
algorithmic knowledge I we have tons of
cool stuff around in puffer lib like I
cool stuff around in puffer lib like I
have new contributors that I've been
have new contributors that I've been
showing how to write million step per
showing how to write million step per
second like ultra high performance
second like ultra high performance
environments so we have some people that
environments so we have some people that
are like implementing the Atari games
are like implementing the Atari games
from scratch but like the Atari games
from scratch but like the Atari games
now Run a thousand times faster so we
now Run a thousand times faster so we
can train Ultra well and then they're
can train Ultra well and then they're
like using puffer to run run their
like using puffer to run run their
experiments and then they're running
experiments and then they're running
like their own hyper parameter sweeps
like their own hyper parameter sweeps
and stuff so we have that type of a
and stuff so we have that type of a
thing going on but if you really want to
thing going on but if you really want to
like know the algorithm side vanilla
like know the algorithm side vanilla
policy gradients or dqn from scratch
policy gradients or dqn from scratch
would be the general
suggestion stuff gets harder after that
suggestion stuff gets harder after that
like good po implementations even like
like good po implementations even like
poo is one of the simpler algorithms but
poo is one of the simpler algorithms but
honestly really good RL implementations
honestly really good RL implementations
can take months
like if I had to implement Po from
like if I had to implement Po from
scratch right now even having done that
scratch right now even having done that
multiple times I it would take me a long
multiple times I it would take me a long
time to do
well cuz things are just tricky man it's
well cuz things are just tricky man it's
just
tricky for
I will also say when I started an
I will also say when I started an
ml uh and I tried to do a lot of stuff
ml uh and I tried to do a lot of stuff
from scratch there was much pain in
from scratch there was much pain in
suffering like I spent many thousands of
suffering like I spent many thousands of
hours from age like 16
hours from age like 16
to
to
20 pretty much age 16 to 20 was all just
20 pretty much age 16 to 20 was all just
like stum in around trying to do [ __ ]
like stum in around trying to do [ __ ]
and everything being really hard and
and everything being really hard and
confusing and everything taking 20 times
confusing and everything taking 20 times
longer than it should
um but hey I mean the Crux of that was
um but hey I mean the Crux of that was
like when I finally sort of figured some
like when I finally sort of figured some
stuff out and I managed to get soda on
stuff out and I managed to get soda on
like a really simple language modeling
like a really simple language modeling
task uh and I was able like I published
task uh and I was able like I published
My First Single author paper off of that
My First Single author paper off of that
and I mean from that I got you know my
and I mean from that I got you know my
open AI internship and you know then I
open AI internship and you know then I
got into my PhD and you know all sorts
got into my PhD and you know all sorts
of things from
there it's a little tough cuz the things
there it's a little tough cuz the things
that I did back then would no longer be
that I did back then would no longer be
considered
considered
impressive and like it's actually kind
impressive and like it's actually kind
of fair because it's not like oh yeah
of fair because it's not like oh yeah
the people just got way smarter that's
the people just got way smarter that's
why everybody's doing better stuff now
why everybody's doing better stuff now
it's uh that the tools got better so
it's uh that the tools got better so
like the stuff that we did back then was
like the stuff that we did back then was
really hard to do CU we didn't even have
really hard to do CU we didn't even have
half different learn decent learning
half different learn decent learning
libraries but nowadays like you have
libraries but nowadays like you have
that stuff so the bar goes up a
ton for
sounds like a grandpa talking about 8
sounds like a grandpa talking about 8
megabyte hdds they could sit on a table
megabyte hdds they could sit on a table
Yeah but Gramp's got
hands is Gramp's got
hands thumbnails ooh hold
hands thumbnails ooh hold
on let me fix one thing
what
what
ooh let me
ooh let me
un how do you work this fast the [ __ ]
you made a lot of different Towers
you made a lot of different Towers
didn't
didn't
you
holy did you make six of them for a
holy did you make six of them for a
particular
reason I can see
reason I can see
Silhouettes draw a long
time I think
technically I think I can technically
technically I think I can technically
make these like tier one tier two tier
make these like tier one tier two tier
three tier four tier five
I'd have to modify a little bit of how
I'd have to modify a little bit of how
the game represents the
towers part of the thumbnailing I'd
towers part of the thumbnailing I'd
never heard the word thumbnailing
never heard the word thumbnailing
process
okay does doing Alpha Zero from sort of
okay does doing Alpha Zero from sort of
scratch
help that seems [ __ ] hard I'd have to
help that seems [ __ ] hard I'd have to
look at the details of that paper it's
look at the details of that paper it's
been so long does that seem like
been so long does that seem like
something reasonable that you can
something reasonable that you can
do disposable let me
do disposable let me
see so I think that this one right here
see so I think that this one right here
we could scale this one up like 4X and
we could scale this one up like 4X and
use this as the uh the ancient or
whatever I think my favorites are this
whatever I think my favorites are this
one this one and this
one this one and this
one I'm trying to think what I want to
one I'm trying to think what I want to
use each of them
for looks good
I mean you've drawn some stuff that like
I mean you've drawn some stuff that like
probably lends itself to some really
probably lends itself to some really
cool like three frame
animations with like the stuff on the
top number
top number
five is your personal Peck
number five is pretty
good yeah this one's nice and simple
good yeah this one's nice and simple
this one works in your two uh two bit
this one works in your two uh two bit
art style very well well maybe it does I
art style very well well maybe it does I
think it I think it would also look
think it I think it would also look
better with three colors um like the
better with three colors um like the
base the outline and then like the
base the outline and then like the
top I think that the one on the left
top I think that the one on the left
here this one could be really cool for
here this one could be really cool for
the ancient cuz you know what this
the ancient cuz you know what this
reminds me of this like this looks like
reminds me of this like this looks like
this could be like a vent you know like
this could be like a vent you know like
a like a vent like the underwater vent
a like a vent like the underwater vent
or whatever and like this like stuff
or whatever and like this like stuff
could be like you know whatever Vapors
could be like you know whatever Vapors
or whatever floating up from like an
or whatever floating up from like an
underwater
underwater
vent that would be like a really cool
vent that would be like a really cool
like Nexus you know like the objective
like Nexus you know like the objective
of the game
thing yeah I think I think if you want
thing yeah I think I think if you want
to just
to just
do two two of them it would be these
do two two of them it would be these
two a
two a
pearl
e you know what I would use a pearl
e you know what I would use a pearl
for I don't
know star Pearl if I were to like Bounty
know star Pearl if I were to like Bounty
runes or something like that to the game
runes or something like that to the game
which I don't have yet so you don't have
which I don't have yet so you don't have
to make it at the moment but like you
to make it at the moment but like you
could totally make the Bounty runes be
could totally make the Bounty runes be
like a clam or like an oyster where like
like a clam or like an oyster where like
when the bounty Rune isn't there the
when the bounty Rune isn't there the
oyster is closed and when the bounty
oyster is closed and when the bounty
Rune is there it's like open with like a
Rune is there it's like open with like a
pearl in
it
right that'd be pretty cool
they are sweet
looking
looking
oops Let's
oops Let's
uh sneak
preview I'll clean up five and hold on
preview I'll clean up five and hold on
to one sounds good
where's my

food technically I have shown portions
food technically I have shown portions
of this on stream but then I got way
of this on stream but then I got way
more serious about it I'm like okay
more serious about it I'm like okay
we're going to like hide this so that

the initial edits on this
the initial edits on this
video I think I'm good I basically just

have a couple
have a couple
transitions to
finish and then we'll be good
hey
welcome usually we're writing code here

I'm not writing code because I'm
I'm not writing code because I'm
finishing this ridiculously labor
finishing this ridiculously labor
intensive video in the background that's

all
blurry um I'm hoping that this will be
blurry um I'm hoping that this will be
up next week and then I'll be able to be
up next week and then I'll be able to be
doing cool code on stream all week but
doing cool code on stream all week but
for now I'm hanging around chatting
for now I'm hanging around chatting
about reinforcement learning and
about reinforcement learning and
finishing up edits

a models actually make good stock
a models actually make good stock
footage I don't know if I should start
footage I don't know if I should start
learning RL by reading rs's RL book and
learning RL by reading rs's RL book and
implementing it or if I should start
implementing it or if I should start
with Pokemon
with Pokemon
RL can you give me some advice on how I
RL can you give me some advice on how I
should start learning reinforcement
should start learning reinforcement
learning uh so I it depends on whether
learning uh so I it depends on whether
you have experience in any other areas
you have experience in any other areas
of AI like do you have experience with
of AI like do you have experience with
any other areas of
any other areas of
ml or is this like brand new to RL well
ml or is this like brand new to RL well
it's like I should actually start with
it's like I should actually start with
like do you have experience in software
like do you have experience in software
engineering do you have experience in
engineering do you have experience in
like any math do you have experience in
like any math do you have experience in
AI as a whole in like Visionary language
AI as a whole in like Visionary language
like what are we starting with
I have experience with NLP okay great so
I have experience with NLP okay great so
that's where I was when I started as
that's where I was when I started as
well I generally suggest people read
well I generally suggest people read
some papers not a ton like between five
some papers not a ton like between five
and 10 papers in RL to get a sense of
and 10 papers in RL to get a sense of
things these would be like
things these would be like
dqn uh
po oh how many do I pick if I had did
po oh how many do I pick if I had did
pick
five okay we'll be super biased and I'll
five okay we'll be super biased and I'll
include mine as one of them uh
include mine as one of them uh
dqn
dqn
po uh DOTA open ai5 Alpha
po uh DOTA open ai5 Alpha
star and the puffer paper because I'll
star and the puffer paper because I'll
be biased on my own
be biased on my own
there that will give you a pretty decent
there that will give you a pretty decent
grounding
grounding
of in like at least some of RL obviously
of in like at least some of RL obviously
you'll want to read some more than some
you'll want to read some more than some
more along the way but that will give
more along the way but that will give
you some
you some
grounding then on the Practical side I
grounding then on the Practical side I
would look at
would look at
you should understand like vanilla
you should understand like vanilla
policy gradients and like what a q
policy gradients and like what a q
function
function
is and outside of that I would suggest
is and outside of that I would suggest
looking at clean RL and getting familiar
looking at clean RL and getting familiar
with some of those
with some of those
implementations and uh from there you
implementations and uh from there you
can probably start looking at some of
can probably start looking at some of
the stuff in poer lib because like we
the stuff in poer lib because like we
really aren't that algorithm
really aren't that algorithm
heavy um most of the stuff that's in
heavy um most of the stuff that's in
poer that lets you do cool work is just
poer that lets you do cool work is just
like we've done engineering to make
like we've done engineering to make
things very very simple and very very
things very very simple and very very
fast so it's like the same po
fast so it's like the same po
implementation basically as clean rl's
implementation basically as clean rl's
but ours is like 100 times faster
thank you yeah no worries and by the way
thank you yeah no worries and by the way
we've got
we've got
like we have new people who have like
like we have new people who have like
contributed tons to the Pokemon project
contributed tons to the Pokemon project
um that started out with less experience
um that started out with less experience
than you and just like worked a bunch on
than you and just like worked a bunch on
stuff we have other other people that
stuff we have other other people that
are in a similar spot to you uh even
are in a similar spot to you uh even
like less on the AI side that are now
like less on the AI side that are now

um the rendering is always the easy
um the rendering is always the easy
part the rendering is not that bad you
part the rendering is not that bad you
need the logic needs to be fast is the
need the logic needs to be fast is the
main thing
that's the hard part
so obnoxious I can't just add a freaking
so obnoxious I can't just add a freaking
cross disolve here
guess this is good enough
right okay that's a good initial
right okay that's a good initial
edit we
edit we
have just over 25 minutes of footage for
have just over 25 minutes of footage for
the video
the video
um food's almost here so this is where
um food's almost here so this is where
I'm going to call it for today folks let
I'm going to call it for today folks let
me close this and I can undo the blur
me close this and I can undo the blur
and all the other stuff
um okay
so thanks for dropping by everyone um
so thanks for dropping by everyone um
Tower in 30 seconds okay I'll wait for
that this article this puffer Hardware
that this article this puffer Hardware
article was uh from 325 Stars just like
article was uh from 325 Stars just like
two three months ago not
two three months ago not
even so uh if you want to support the
even so uh if you want to support the
project for
project for
free and have Ultra fast reinforcement
free and have Ultra fast reinforcement
learning you can contribute to this as
learning you can contribute to this as
well by the way and we do cool stuff on
well by the way and we do cool stuff on
stream with
stream with
contributors um but yeah hey we hit 875
contributors um but yeah hey we hit 875
today which is awesome I'll put the link
today which is awesome I'll put the link
in the
in the
chat you can start the project to help
chat you can start the project to help
us
us
out you can also join the Discord we've
out you can also join the Discord we've
got lots of people developing really
got lots of people developing really
cool simulators which is the main push
cool simulators which is the main push
for puffer going forward here this video
for puffer going forward here this video
is going to be done over the weekend and
is going to be done over the weekend and
out probably
out probably
Monday uh and after that it'll be back
Monday uh and after that it'll be back
to all the cool Dev so that'll be fun
to all the cool Dev so that'll be fun
let's take a look at this artwork
so will be
so will be
awesome
awesome
[Music]
[Music]
whoa hold
whoa hold
on now with
shading
whoa it's going to need some color for
whoa it's going to need some color for
like the coral on the top or something
like the coral on the top or something
right cuz it's not going to stand out
right cuz it's not going to stand out
from the dark background but yeah this
from the dark background but yeah this
shade is awesome holy
shade is awesome holy
I think wait to upgrade the characters
I think wait to upgrade the characters
until
until
um until we see if we finalize stuff
um until we see if we finalize stuff
because I know it's like way harder to
because I know it's like way harder to
edit once you start shading and stuff
edit once you start shading and stuff
but yeah holy
hell holy hell this is
hell holy hell this is
nice wait is this supposed to be
nice wait is this supposed to be
something is this supposed to be like a
something is this supposed to be like a
face or something here or is this just
face or something here or is this just
like just so happens to be I can't tell
this is going to be so cool to have
this is going to be so cool to have
these as
Towers that's
awesome I I think that if you want to do
awesome I I think that if you want to do
a couple little things today like figure
a couple little things today like figure
out like what portion I think like the
out like what portion I think like the
coral bit at the top would probably get
coral bit at the top would probably get
the tint on it something's going to have
the tint on it something's going to have
to be can and something's going to have
to be can and something's going to have
to be red to represent the two different
to be red to represent the two different
teams so like you know maybe this piece
teams so like you know maybe this piece
is red for the dire team and like Canan
is red for the dire team and like Canan
for the radiant team or whatever um I
for the radiant team or whatever um I
don't know maybe some like some sort of
