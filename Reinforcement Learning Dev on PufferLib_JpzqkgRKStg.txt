Um okay. Why don't you send me over the
Um okay. Why don't you send me over the
latest stuff and we will take a
look. I also think I fixed sweeps uh in

the brief period after after those
the brief period after after those
calls. So hopefully we actually have
calls. So hopefully we actually have
that stuff working
again pretty
again pretty
good. All right. Uh, let me go ahead and
good. All right. Uh, let me go ahead and
drop you a recent link. And it looks
drop you a recent link. And it looks
like it's kind of doing [ __ ] So, all
like it's kind of doing [ __ ] So, all
right.
[Music]
Okay. The episode return is weird, but
Okay. The episode return is weird, but
the scorecard is going up. So, we'll see
the scorecard is going up. So, we'll see
if that's just a matter of my login
if that's just a matter of my login
weird.
weird.
This one you just linked
This one you just linked
or what? All right, here we go.
or what? All right, here we go.
642 1B.
Yeah, that one. This one.
Yeah, that one. This one.
Um, hold up. Let me put up your stream
Um, hold up. Let me put up your stream
on my screen so I can see what you're
on my screen so I can see what you're
looking at.
looking at.
Oh, yeah. That's way better. Cool.
Oh, yeah. That's way better. Cool.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See, it's do
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See, it's do
it's doing things. Is this with
it's doing things. Is this with
collisions on or not? What is this? This
collisions on or not? What is this? This
is with collisions on. Weirdly enough,
is with collisions on. Weirdly enough,
with collisions off, it can't learn
with collisions off, it can't learn
anything.
anything.
Huh.
Huh.
Interesting. Because all it does, it
Interesting. Because all it does, it
just respawns back in where it starts.
just respawns back in where it starts.
And it's like, what? What the [ __ ] just
And it's like, what? What the [ __ ] just
happened to me?
It should still be able to learn stuff
It should still be able to learn stuff
from that if it's getting the collision
from that if it's getting the collision
reward. But that's weird. Yeah. Yeah, I
reward. But that's weird. Yeah. Yeah, I
mean the collision reward to be getting
mean the collision reward to be getting
is zero if it's if you set it the
is zero if it's if you set it the
penalty zero, but Oh, I see. But it it
penalty zero, but Oh, I see. But it it
respawns and it doesn't get a reward and
respawns and it doesn't get a reward and
it doesn't know like why like So then
it doesn't know like why like So then
yeah, that actually makes sense then.
yeah, that actually makes sense then.
Oh, great universe. Why did I just get
Oh, great universe. Why did I just get
located to a random place? Yep, that's
located to a random place? Yep, that's
fine. So, uh I mean this then is better
fine. So, uh I mean this then is better
than we had before without collision but
than we had before without collision but
with collisions, right?
with collisions, right?
This
This
is right now for sure better than before
is right now for sure better than before
without
without
collisions and especially in terms of
collisions and especially in terms of
like speed because we had a speed issue,
like speed because we had a speed issue,
right? Um the off-road rate is probably
right? Um the off-road rate is probably
some of the best I have this far. Now
some of the best I have this far. Now
the true test is to see whether this
the true test is to see whether this
actually eval. So that's yet to be
actually eval. So that's yet to be
determined. It still has another two
determined. It still has another two
minutes to go on this run. Okay. I mean,
minutes to go on this run. Okay. I mean,
and also sometimes if it if it dips
and also sometimes if it if it dips
towards the end, uh, cosign and nailing,
towards the end, uh, cosign and nailing,
there's um there's some stuff I need to
there's um there's some stuff I need to
look at with that. I don't think I'm
look at with that. I don't think I'm
doing it right.
doing it right.
Uh, one thing that's for sure weird that
Uh, one thing that's for sure weird that
I've noticed after running longer
I've noticed after running longer
experiments is it is almost a guarantee
experiments is it is almost a guarantee
that if you get to around like 500
that if you get to around like 500
million steps, the entropy just does
million steps, the entropy just does
some weird stuff.
some weird stuff.
like it'll just like drop like a rock
like it'll just like drop like a rock
and then your policy will start doing
and then your policy will start doing
weird things and then it'll like try and
weird things and then it'll like try and
recover entropy again and then it'll
recover entropy again and then it'll
like go back to learning again.
like go back to learning again.
Yeah, that's so I don't know what's up
Yeah, that's so I don't know what's up
with that. I don't know either. It is
with that. I don't know either. It is
something that I've
something that I've
noticed. All right. So, uh we got
noticed. All right. So, uh we got
entropy, we got
entropy, we got
score,
score,
and I mean we'll see which of these
and I mean we'll see which of these
don't work. Is this all already after
don't work. Is this all already after
filtering or no?
Like they had a they had filtering stuff
Like they had a they had filtering stuff
for like invalid cars and goals and
for like invalid cars and goals and
stuff, didn't they?
stuff, didn't they?
Yeah. So, this has a a decent amount of
Yeah. So, this has a a decent amount of
that in terms of like a bunch of cleanup
that in terms of like a bunch of cleanup
on the maps. But, weirdly enough, even
on the maps. But, weirdly enough, even
after all the
after all the
cleanup, they so they did some cleanup
cleanup, they so they did some cleanup
on the levels that I downloaded, right?
on the levels that I downloaded, right?
But even with post their cleanup, I have
But even with post their cleanup, I have
some cleanup after that. and it's still
some cleanup after that. and it's still
not perfectly clean. So, I was trying to
not perfectly clean. So, I was trying to
set up
set up
um their original actual just GPU drive
um their original actual just GPU drive
project, but funny enough because I like
project, but funny enough because I like
I just bought the new box. Um it's not
I just bought the new box. Um it's not
compatible because CUDA that's um on 124
compatible because CUDA that's um on 124
and that's funny can only use 129 CUDA
and that's funny can only use 129 CUDA
or whatever without 128. Yeah, that's
or whatever without 128. Yeah, that's
funny.
funny.
So, I wanted to look at the I wanted if
So, I wanted to look at the I wanted if
you could do that, that would be really
you could do that, that would be really
helpful is if you could pull up a map
helpful is if you could pull up a map
that can render on their end because
that can render on their end because
that's the one thing that I'd be trippy
that's the one thing that I'd be trippy
about because my end was still showing
about because my end was still showing
that if you run through the expert
that if you run through the expert
trajectories Mhm. there's still
trajectories Mhm. there's still
collisions in off-road, but it should be
collisions in off-road, but it should be
zero because otherwise your optimal
zero because otherwise your optimal
trajectory has [ __ ] going on.
trajectory has [ __ ] going on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
Um,
well that's funny.
well that's funny.
Do they not have like they don't have
Do they not have like they don't have
like onload filtering? They don't have
like onload filtering? They don't have
like any like runtime other shenanigans.
like any like runtime other shenanigans.
Um, I mean from what I've seen I mean
Um, I mean from what I've seen I mean
I've asked them quite a few questions on
I've asked them quite a few questions on
the subject of it and you know it seems
the subject of it and you know it seems
like they I have reviewed it that they
like they I have reviewed it that they
are doing a good amount of filtering and
are doing a good amount of filtering and
cleaning up ahead of it. Mhm. Um, and I
cleaning up ahead of it. Mhm. Um, and I
just added one of the things that was
just added one of the things that was
not the same where I subtract the mean
not the same where I subtract the mean
to all the
to all the
positions and I was seeing if that did
positions and I was seeing if that did
anything with learning, but it turns out
anything with learning, but it turns out
that's just a camera trick so that all
that's just a camera trick so that all
the maps origin stays at zero.
Um, okay. So, it just finished. It got
Um, okay. So, it just finished. It got
93% score. Let me see what happens if I
93% score. Let me see what happens if I
try and eval the map.
try and eval the map.
Should be able to like see some cool
Should be able to like see some cool
stuff happening, right?
stuff happening, right?
You would think so at 90 something%.
You would think so at 90 something%.
It should be at least like decent.
Eval for this is really annoying though
Eval for this is really annoying though
I have to say because of the way I've
I have to say because of the way I've
set it up
set it up
um of the fact that like each env in it
um of the fact that like each env in it
is an independent
map. When you do roll out you can only
map. When you do roll out you can only
roll out one map.
roll out one map.
So the way that we do it that I do it by
So the way that we do it that I do it by
default with all the M's is we just
default with all the M's is we just
render the first one and call it a day.
Sure. And I mean like that's fine, but
Sure. And I mean like that's fine, but
like it'd be nice if on this it would
like it'd be nice if on this it would
for specifically this type of thing
for specifically this type of thing
whenever it's running you can like have
whenever it's running you can like have
it jump to another map.
it jump to another map.
Yeah, you can do that potentially. You'd
Yeah, you can do that potentially. You'd
have to add the key binds.
All right. Actually, that's that's all
All right. Actually, that's that's all
you'd have to do is add the key binds
you'd have to do is add the key binds
and you could just tap over maps.
and you could just tap over maps.
Well, no, because you have to
Well, no, because you have to
reinitialize the map. Why do you have to
reinitialize the map. Why do you have to
reinitialize the map? Because
reinitialize the map? Because
each each of the ends is only getting
each each of the ends is only getting
that map to play with.
that map to play with.
Yeah. So, the way that that works
Yeah. So, the way that that works
though, right, is that the map has a
though, right, is that the map has a
client, right? And the client has a
client, right? And the client has a
render function and you just need to
render function and you just need to
know which one actually has to call

if you set up a Oh, I guess I see
if you set up a Oh, I guess I see

correct.
correct.
Correct. That's why it's a little funky.
Correct. That's why it's a little funky.
Yeah. Okay. Well, we'll figure something
Yeah. Okay. Well, we'll figure something

with that. But I mean, that's just stuff
for later. I mean, it's not like dire,

Oh.
Uhhuh. That is a car going to a goal.
Why are there cars just like in the
Why are there cars just like in the
middle of nowhere?
Why does it like move so
wiggly? Dynamics

Okay, we should fix
that. I mean, it works though,
right? It's actually It's screwing up
right? It's actually It's screwing up
occasionally because of the
occasionally because of the

That's
weird. Yeah. So, this should be very
weird. Yeah. So, this should be very
easy.
easy.
Um, we're going to have to look at the
Um, we're going to have to look at the
action space and stuff and maybe like

try to drive the cars.
One more back to training. We can do one
One more back to training. We can do one
more real quick and then we will go back
more real quick and then we will go back
to uh looking at it. I have some

or the other?
There's a
There's a
straight. Why the cars are damn wiggly
then? It should learn. If it just stops
then? It should learn. If it just stops
wiggling so much, it'll do better.
It's randomly disappearing

and its performance was actually a

just did. So I'm a little curious to

find out if I make it negative one
find out if I make it negative one
if I just like hyper punish it will it

know. Um, but if there's other things,
do you want me to push this right now so
do you want me to push this right now so
that you can do stuff while Sure.
Okay. Well, I think you have to PR it
Okay. Well, I think you have to PR it
technically, right? Yeah, I'm have to PR

it to Puffer Drive. That's an easy quick

just my way for the blue car to turn red
just my way for the blue car to turn red
when it collides, but I don't know if

there's a better way you want to
there's a better way you want to
describe that. That's

fine. But yeah, ideally an explosion
fine. But yeah, ideally an explosion
would be good. I think I think dynamics
would be good. I think I think dynamics
is a little screwy. Look at these
is a little screwy. Look at these
freaking cars.
Yeah. What?
Yeah. What?
I think those cars are marked experts
I think those cars are marked experts
for some reason. Yeah, they're experts

But there's also a chance I probably

screwed something up there, but we'll
screwed something up there, but we'll
see. All right, so we're going to start

uh we're going to start messing with
uh we're going to start messing with
some
things. Unfortunately, we can only do
things. Unfortunately, we can only do
copies of

of the uh like the mini batch thing we

because I would like to have more than
because I would like to have more than
75 scenes. You know, they they're good
75 scenes. You know, they they're good

Um you know, it doesn't have to be 75,
Um you know, it doesn't have to be 75,
right? It it can be like I think up to
right? It it can be like I think up to
512 I want to say, but then the batch
512 I want to say, but then the batch
size increases a bunch and it's slow. So
size increases a bunch and it's slow. So
I have to replicate that over all the
I have to replicate that over all the
different different cores. Okay. Which
different different cores. Okay. Which
is not fun.
is not fun.
Well, the quickest thing to make it
Well, the quickest thing to make it
faster is just to reduce the
faster is just to reduce the
ops. But I don't know if you want to
ops. But I don't know if you want to
start with that.
start with that.
You know, we'll consider it.
because you have to remember so
because you have to remember so
originally I I was only using road edges
originally I I was only using road edges
as part of the ops but then I decided to
as part of the ops but then I decided to
throw in the whole thing so that it
throw in the whole thing so that it
matches the GPU drive actual project
matches the GPU drive actual project
where they're looking at like lanes and
where they're looking at like lanes and
lines
lines
and all the other classifications of
and all the other classifications of
roads but in reality the model only
roads but in reality the model only
cares about road edges.
This is true. And I when I ran a test
This is true. And I when I ran a test

What does Puffer Lib do? Is it like
What does Puffer Lib do? Is it like
PyTorch for RL? We use PyTorch, but

yeah, we try to make reinforcement
yeah, we try to make reinforcement
learning really, really fast and really,
learning really, really fast and really,
really simple. And the thing is it's not
really simple. And the thing is it's not
quite like PyTorch because the key thing
quite like PyTorch because the key thing
that's difficult about RL is you need to
that's difficult about RL is you need to
run a bunch of environments really
run a bunch of environments really
really fast and get data from them in a

very tight loop. That is the thing
very tight loop. That is the thing
that's hard. Also your models tend to be
that's hard. Also your models tend to be
very small. When your models are small,
very small. When your models are small,
little bits of overhead matter way more.
little bits of overhead matter way more.
It's like so much easier to like
It's like so much easier to like
optimize overhead on a language model

versus like a little tiny RLN net. thing

that's hard with language models is like
that's hard with language models is like
actually getting your getting your GPUs
actually getting your getting your GPUs
saturated with good kernels and stuff
saturated with good kernels and stuff
and then all the distributed stuff is a

nightmare. But like you know you little
nightmare. But like you know you little
bits of Python code you write on top of
bits of Python code you write on top of
that doesn't matter because the language
that doesn't matter because the language
model's way slower in RL everything

matters.
Yeah, the whole starting at 50% score is
Yeah, the whole starting at 50% score is
really sussing me out.
I don't know how that's really
I don't know how that's really

right
because that that means that well

actually it could be that um if there's

some agents that are basically on top of
some agents that are basically on top of
their goal right they're just going to
their goal right they're just going to
get it constantly distance is two two
get it constantly distance is two two
meters is like what's considered and I
meters is like what's considered and I
know that there are some goals that are
know that there are some goals that are
within like if two is the minimum
within like if two is the minimum
allowed I think there are some goals

that are sub five which is one square on
that are sub five which is one square on
the thing. So, you just like hit forward
the thing. So, you just like hit forward
and you get it. Yeah, basically. Well, I
and you get it. Yeah, basically. Well, I
mean, that could account for it, right?

Cuz it just does that repeatedly. But,
Cuz it just does that repeatedly. But,
weirdly, I didn't see that on my

just couldn't figure it out. But you
just couldn't figure it out. But you
didn't see that. What? This is with the
didn't see that. What? This is with the

Yeah. versus only one time at the end of
Yeah. versus only one time at the end of
a 91st step segment. You could modify
a 91st step segment. You could modify
this score metric so they still get
this score metric so they still get
their reward, but the score they only
their reward, but the score they only
get at most once per episode if you want
get at most once per episode if you want
to keep it consistent with the original.
Could do that. Um, but then don't I have
Could do that. Um, but then don't I have
to change how ad log works or No, no,
to change how ad log works or No, no,
just when you call it.
Well, I guess I already Okay, so I call
Well, I guess I already Okay, so I call
ad
ad
log when they get the goal, when they
log when they get the goal, when they
hit something, and also at the end of
hit something, and also at the end of
the 91st step segment before
the 91st step segment before
resetting because I fig the three
resetting because I fig the three
conditions in which the world. Yeah. So
conditions in which the world. Yeah. So
instead of doing that basically, right,
instead of doing that basically, right,
you would just log once at 91 with did
you would just log once at 91 with did
it ever get the

numbum cars, right? Got goal this
numbum cars, right? Got goal this

man. Yeah, I already have. Yeah, I
man. Yeah, I already have. Yeah, I
already have gold this episode. Or are
already have gold this episode. Or are
you just reading the code?
you just reading the code?
No, I just am guessing. Oh, no. That's
No, I just am guessing. Oh, no. That's

can't tell if they're stuck.
Um like log
Um like log

x-axis. I mean I mean I've been doing
this stuff since I was like 16. Uh it
this stuff since I was like 16. Uh it

um I have a guide on my website for

the fundamentals of that will cover

I mean, this is a good log linear graph,
I mean, this is a good log linear graph,
I will say. so
far. Now, why is it log linear? Like,
far. Now, why is it log linear? Like,
why does it take this long? I don't
know. Could be

hypers, could be obs. Could be a mix of
hypers, could be obs. Could be a mix of
the both,
the both,
right? I mean, do you really think that
right? I mean, do you really think that
like I mean, what are you at like 100
like I mean, what are you at like 100
million steps right now? 200.
Uh, what' you say? I'm at 200.
Uh, what' you say? I'm at 200.
I think it took them how many steps?
I think it took them how many steps?
Like 500 million.
I think that's for more m
I think that's for more m
though. Wrong foundation. I think next
though. Wrong foundation. I think next
step is doing a paper. Send your website
step is doing a paper. Send your website
link. It's puffer.ai.
They're at like well yes they are doing
They're at like well yes they are doing
way more so to be I don't know if that's
way more so to be I don't know if that's
easier. I think it was harder generally
easier. I think it was harder generally
or it was it was more stable. It's for
or it was it was more stable. It's for
sure has to be more stable because if

you have like a really whack map in one

Okay. What was it getting before you did
Okay. What was it getting before you did
that?
that?
Before I made this change, it peaked at
Before I made this change, it peaked at
like 91 92.
So, that's what I'm seeing here. It
So, that's what I'm seeing here. It
spiked to like 93 randomly one time.
If you link to GitHub real quick, I'll
If you link to GitHub real quick, I'll
take a quick look at code.
take a quick look at code.
Now I'm hovering at like 94 95. Okay,
Now I'm hovering at like 94 95. Okay,
we'll see. I will say I did get a very
we'll see. I will say I did get a very
nice log linear. So what I did for
nice log linear. So what I did for
reference, the thing that I did uh I
reference, the thing that I did uh I
changed it to just under like
changed it to just under like
8192 m. So I I took it down to 64 maps
8192 m. So I I took it down to 64 maps
and uh I upped it to 16 workers. You get
and uh I upped it to 16 workers. You get
a total of like 8192. So M goes to 1%.
a total of like 8192. So M goes to 1%.
And uh I set the BPT or I set the

exactly.
So you're training on mini batches of

full
full
rollouts. Oh, that's
clever. All right. All right. I'm like
clever. All right. All right. I'm like
getting a little bit stuck, but I'm at
getting a little bit stuck, but I'm at
95%.
95%.
It did kind of well it evened out at the

Let me let me link you the one the

All right. I just linked you my current

I'll do that.
I'll do that.
But it does look like it's whole it's
But it does look like it's whole it's
kind of getting stuck now at 95.
kind of getting stuck now at 95.
95 is better than you've seen, right? 95
95 is better than you've seen, right? 95
is definitely better than I've seen
is definitely better than I've seen
without a question.
without a question.
So, as I said, you fixed the dumb asking
So, as I said, you fixed the dumb asking
thing. Yeah. Yeah. I to be fair though I

think probably it is getting a little
think probably it is getting a little

There is some amount of upper bound due
There is some amount of upper bound due
to that problem. Now, as to what it is
to that problem. Now, as to what it is
statistically, I have no not a single
clip. Well, now we're trending at
280. My off-road rate is now at a pretty
280. My off-road rate is now at a pretty
good situation. It's less than 1%.
good situation. It's less than 1%.
which means it's fully deter learned
which means it's fully deter learned
that don't hit a curb.
that don't hit a curb.
Does it reset on off-road or no? Yes, it
Does it reset on off-road or no? Yes, it
does
both off-road and
both off-road and

We could just see if this changes the
We could just see if this changes the

My curve is just a is basically just on

All right. Look at
this self-driving. Yeah. So, this is an
this self-driving. Yeah. So, this is an
N. Uh, so this is based on an N by NYU,
N. Uh, so this is based on an N by NYU,
which is a GPU accelerated driving sim.
which is a GPU accelerated driving sim.
Spencer here ported it to Puffer Lib on
Spencer here ported it to Puffer Lib on
CPU and made it faster. So now we have
CPU and made it faster. So now we have
our own uh our own sim that's like
our own uh our own sim that's like
really fast that we can run tons of
really fast that we can run tons of
experiments on. So we're trying to
experiments on. So we're trying to
basically make uh a better version of
basically make uh a better version of
NYU's sim so that they can use it for
NYU's sim so that they can use it for
their research. We can do cool stuff
their research. We can do cool stuff
with it in Puffer Lib and everyone's
with it in Puffer Lib and everyone's
happy. All right. My my thing just
happy. All right. My my thing just
stopped at
96%. It spiked at the last second to get
96%. It spiked at the last second to get
like a lucky run.
like a lucky run.
Well, it can't spike at the end because
Well, it can't spike at the end because
um so that the last section if you look
um so that the last section if you look
there should be like an extra data point
there should be like an extra data point
at the end
at the end
and that is from we do like a full eval
and that is from we do like a full eval
or like we do a longer eval at the end.
or like we do a longer eval at the end.
So the last metric should not be the
So the last metric should not be the
lucky one. It's actually the more
lucky one. It's actually the more
accurate one.
the one at like the one B reports at the
the one at like the one B reports at the
very end,
very end,
you should see like a flat line or
you should see like a flat line or
whatever, like a flat line segment at
whatever, like a flat line segment at
the end. So that flat line segment, all
the end. So that flat line segment, all
those steps in there are compressed into
those steps in there are compressed into
that last data point.
that last data point.
This is an intentional thing with Puffer
This is an intentional thing with Puffer
so that we get accurate evals. All
so that we get accurate evals. All
right. Well, I'm going to download this
right. Well, I'm going to download this
model and see how it
eval. You see, let's show off the
eval. You see, let's show off the
self-driving
self-driving
sim a little bit for a stream. So, this
sim a little bit for a stream. So, this
is it. Now, the these cars aren't doing
is it. Now, the these cars aren't doing
anything. We're going to have to load in
anything. We're going to have to load in
a policy to see them do anything. But,
a policy to see them do anything. But,
uh yeah, you know, you can load in
uh yeah, you know, you can load in

switch to a different car.
Yeah. Yeah. If you hold Yeah. If you
Yeah. Yeah. If you hold Yeah. If you
hold control, it puts it in that mode.
hold control, it puts it in that mode.
And if you hold if you hold shift
And if you hold if you hold shift
um you you can use the arrow keys. So if
um you you can use the arrow keys. So if
you use the arrow keys, it'll increment
you use the arrow keys, it'll increment
your acceleration or your um steering by
your acceleration or your um steering by
one just based off the index of its
one just based off the index of its
position. So if you go to like
position. So if you go to like
acceleration, okay, well that's going to
acceleration, okay, well that's going to
really hurt your brain. But what is
really hurt your brain. But what is
this?
this?
Uh you're going in a circle right now
Uh you're going in a circle right now
because you're steering. So go on the
because you're steering. So go on the
press right arrow a few times so you get
press right arrow a few times so you get
your steering to around
six and once you get to a steering of
six and once you get to a steering of
six should be going in a straight fine.
This is uh probably a bad time to
This is uh probably a bad time to
mention. Uh I actually don't have a
mention. Uh I actually don't have a

making RL ludicrously better in very

I mean, that's what that the NYU team
I mean, that's what that the NYU team
talked about a lot in their in their

it should be doing
better. All right. Well, you could try
better. All right. Well, you could try
decreasing the collision uh the
decreasing the collision uh the

Yeah, try that. It was weird. At zero,

Well, yeah. Zero. It's not

5 percentage collision rate makes sense,

What's DNF rate?

we It's probably just to shut up and

this onto the latest release branch just

so we can like use the fixes in there
so we can like use the fixes in there
and like run a proper sweep.

Um, yeah, I'm fine with that. It

shouldn't really be any different. Like,

I didn't mess with that stuff.

Well, I don't know what the difference

is
is
between. You may want to pull release

into whatever puffer drive branch this
is. Well, I'm at 96 now, too. But it's

bouncing between six and

Has yours gone to 97 at all or no?
No.
Finally, we do want a completion rate

then ship it to you.
Arguably it should just happen at the

Mhm. I question how that's 96%. It's

Fine. All right, I'm putting in a

also. Mine hit 97.
We'll we'll find out if it holds it,
compile some

put the completion rate to be set at the
put the completion rate to be set at the

If you set completion rate be like did

that should be the completion rate.
that should be the completion rate.
Right. It depends when you add log. It

you add a log in, right, that's like
you add a log in, right, that's like

I can't add log multiple times prior to

Uh, no, not really.

Okay. Well, I made it I made training

Wait, but then why would I need a

I'm going to recompile with the uh with

Because the eight is 8% is also not a

Okay. I'm at like 35 right now. All
Okay. I'm at like 35 right now. All
right. Could be a real number. You know,
right. Could be a real number. You know,
it's training on the same thing, though.
it's training on the same thing, though.
Yeah. I mean, it's not like anything has
Yeah. I mean, it's not like anything has
changed in the actual training. It just

Why isn't it real 93? We got some log
Why isn't it real 93? We got some log

All right. I hit you with the latest run

first on Grock plays Pokemon.
Can we get that guy to just like go run
Can we get that guy to just like go run
uh run the thing on Pokemon Blue real
uh run the thing on Pokemon Blue real
quick so we can say like, "Hey, also if
quick so we can say like, "Hey, also if
we beat both games, do you beat both
we beat both games, do you beat both
games?" It would be
fun. Gork plays
Pokemon. All
right, I'm now at a mean
40%. I honestly don't know what would be
40%. I honestly don't know what would be
more stressful in that guy's life. like
more stressful in that guy's life. like
literally being on Grock or on X 24/7 or
literally being on Grock or on X 24/7 or
running six companies. It's like that's
running six companies. It's like that's
kind of a toss up in my
book. Uh we are at 95% with the default
book. Uh we are at 95% with the default
policy.
kind of amusing honestly.
Like I It really shouldn't be any
better. Like like even speed
wise. I thought it should be better
wise. I thought it should be better
because max pooling is an expensive
because max pooling is an expensive
operation.
Why would max be an expensive operation?
Why would max be an expensive operation?
I thought we talked about it last time
I thought we talked about it last time
of like when you're having to call the
of like when you're having to call the
max operation on top of
max operation on top of
uh you now
uh you now
have the first network of your input and
have the first network of your input and
then you're running through another
then you're running through another
layer. So you now have that was a
layer. So you now have that was a
different that was a totally different
different that was a totally different
context though for that.
So it's if you do if you run the full
So it's if you do if you run the full
size layer on each and then you max pull
size layer on each and then you max pull
then yeah but it's supposed to be like a

small layer then max pull and then the
small layer then max pull and then the
bigger

flops. 96.
So yeah, this uh default policy
So yeah, this uh default policy
literally does the same
literally does the same
thing and is faster. There.
All right, I'm now getting stuck at like
All right, I'm now getting stuck at like
43%.
I mean that's more
I mean that's more
reasonable like to what we saw in the
reasonable like to what we saw in the
results and that
would so actually here's the
would so actually here's the
thing the fact that I'm literally doing

just as well if not better with the
just as well if not better with the
default policy you think that the data
default policy you think that the data
is like in the correct order in the

Okay. Right. I would generally hope so,
Okay. Right. I would generally hope so,
but I mean default policy is doing
but I mean default policy is doing
better. Literally feeding the data in a

flat is doing better.
I mean, every time I've checked it's
I mean, every time I've checked it's
fine, but because one time I would like
fine, but because one time I would like
I actually change the observation just
I actually change the observation just
to be like a random number of the first

And the indexing seemed totally fine,
And the indexing seemed totally fine,
but I mean I could be doing something

For sure. I think that whatever we have
For sure. I think that whatever we have
currently on that log shenanigan is
currently on that log shenanigan is
definitely not real. Yeah.
Can't even max this

I don't have float 64 anywhere. Well,
I don't have float 64 anywhere. Well,

Okay.
We're waiting for uh Are you starting?
Is it starting to rise now?
Yep. Yeah. As soon as tariffs are out,
Yep. Yeah. As soon as tariffs are out,
hopefully we just get a whole bunch of
hopefully we just get a whole bunch of

I mean, the fact that this is at least
I mean, the fact that this is at least
going up means we can probably sweep it
going up means we can probably sweep it
to see how much is in the
hypers. And then from
hypers. And then from
there, the thing that's annoying is that
there, the thing that's annoying is that
the hyper prim sweep is not in the best
the hyper prim sweep is not in the best
spot at the moment.
spot at the moment.
So, if we get this into the release
So, if we get this into the release
branch and my other hyper pram sweeps
branch and my other hyper pram sweeps
are good, then what we can do from that
probably. See, are they any
probably. See, are they any
good the first
good the first
run? Hang
run? Hang
on. Oh, no. Okay, that's good. Yeah, we
on. Oh, no. Okay, that's good. Yeah, we
are getting stuff.
Uh, no. It's I'm looking at this is this
Uh, no. It's I'm looking at this is this
is a totally different thing. This is
is a totally different thing. This is
hyper pram sweeps for uh mazes. Um Oh,
hyper pram sweeps for uh mazes. Um Oh,
nice. But yeah, this looks like our
nice. But yeah, this looks like our
hyper pram sweeps at least doing
hyper pram sweeps at least doing
something reasonable. Like if you get
something reasonable. Like if you get
this into the release branch, we can run
this into the release branch, we can run
that hyper pram sweep on it and then
that hyper pram sweep on it and then
that should at least tell us if there's
that should at least tell us if there's
like some alpha left in this
thing,
thing,
right? Yeah, that would be good. And
right? Yeah, that would be good. And
then like and then we'll know if it's
then like and then we'll know if it's
the hypers or not. And then uh it's
the hypers or not. And then uh it's
probably going to be like data problem.
probably going to be like data problem.
It's like always data problem.
Okay.
Okay.
And we can So is the release branch just
And we can So is the release branch just
called like release right now or? Yes.
called like release right now or? Yes.
Okay. It's you're going to see like I've
Okay. It's you're going to see like I've
it's I've done crazy things with it, but
it's I've done crazy things with it, but
none of it should make it particularly
none of it should make it particularly
difficult to do anything with the M's.
difficult to do anything with the M's.
Um, I'm just like doing tons of things
Um, I'm just like doing tons of things
trying to get it ready for the
release. Look how few files we have in
release. Look how few files we have in
here. Oops. This is in
here. Oops. This is in
20 and this is in release. I guess we
20 and this is in release. I guess we
still have a bunch. It's fewer
still have a bunch. It's fewer
though. Like minus
five. Okay. I can't do anything about
five. Okay. I can't do anything about
all the cuda and stuff.
Okay, then. Okay, I'll try and get it
Okay, then. Okay, I'll try and get it
into
into
release. I presume whatever you have in
release. I presume whatever you have in

the general chat. Either way, you can do
that either
way. That's what I did. So, I I mapped

uh episode

That's where mine got stuck at. I don't
That's where mine got stuck at. I don't

sims are cool. I don't really know if
sims are cool. I don't really know if
there's anything to do with RL in them,
there's anything to do with RL in them,
but they're cool.
Okay. Um, I'm gonna head off for tonight
and I'll get that thing signed to you in
and I'll get that thing signed to you in
the morning. Yep. So, I Yeah, that'll be
the morning. Yep. So, I Yeah, that'll be
good. So, I will send that stuff over
good. So, I will send that stuff over
and then I think that the goal for the
and then I think that the goal for the
GPU drive stuff. The best thing we can
GPU drive stuff. The best thing we can
do is just get into release so that we
do is just get into release so that we
can like keep running stuff as we get
can like keep running stuff as we get
closer to release. We'll do a full
closer to release. We'll do a full
sweep, right? We can easily set up a
sweep, right? We can easily set up a
full sweep. Once we have that, you'll
full sweep. Once we have that, you'll
have access to all the latest stuff on
have access to all the latest stuff on
it way more easily. And
it way more easily. And
um it's probably a data problem is my
um it's probably a data problem is my
guess. Yeah. Like I don't see how it
guess. Yeah. Like I don't see how it
wouldn't be. It's not that hard of a
wouldn't be. It's not that hard of a
problem.
It's not that hard of a learning problem
It's not that hard of a learning problem
compared to other stuff. I mean, heck,
compared to other stuff. I mean, heck,
even the maze solving should be harder
even the maze solving should be harder
than this, right?
than this, right?
Yeah. I mean, I I even think that the
Yeah. I mean, I I even think that the
tower climb environment should be
tower climb environment should be

and we're just like we're in space like

Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, a sequential movement. Yeah.
I mean, a sequential movement. Yeah.
There has to be something. Yeah. So, I'm
There has to be something. Yeah. So, I'm
certain I'm going to be really pissed
certain I'm going to be really pissed
off if when we do find it, though. We
off if when we do find it, though. We
should figure out how to get more of
should figure out how to get more of
these things loaded in as well. Um, more
these things loaded in as well. Um, more
of these maps loaded in. You know, like
of these maps loaded in. You know, like
Spencer, it could literally just be as
Spencer, it could literally just be as
simple as like you pick a number of
simple as like you pick a number of

hit that number and you toss the ones
hit that number and you toss the ones
that are go over
that are go over
it. Like, it could be as easy as that.
it. Like, it could be as easy as that.
And then we could randomize the maps. Do
And then we could randomize the maps. Do
we get actually good domain
randomization? That's like trivial,
randomization? That's like trivial,
right?
Yeah, but you're gonna miss out on
Yeah, but you're gonna miss out on
certain maps. No. Or are you going to
certain maps. No. Or are you going to
just try and get it always under your
just try and get it always under your
optimal number because not every map
optimal number because not every map
combo is going to get you to Yeah, just
combo is going to get you to Yeah, just
under like o over either way. So like we
under like o over either way. So like we
specify, let's say we want 512 uh cars
specify, let's say we want 512 uh cars
per worker. So five like per core. We
per worker. So five like per core. We
just make maps until we have 512 of
just make maps until we have 512 of
them. And like they don't have to be the
them. And like they don't have to be the
first end maps anymore either. You just
first end maps anymore either. You just
pick whatever ones until you get to 512
pick whatever ones until you get to 512
total agents. Let's say you get to 520
total agents. Let's say you get to 520
agents, you overshoot. You just drop the
agents, you overshoot. You just drop the
last eight. You don't give them actions
last eight. You don't give them actions
or
anything. Is the dropping part weird?
anything. Is the dropping part weird?
Like how does inside of the actual code?
Like how does inside of the actual code?
No, you just don't give them actions or
No, you just don't give them actions or
you just
I mean it'll muck up the the solve score
I mean it'll muck up the the solve score
by 1%.
Yeah, cuz like what if you your last map
Yeah, cuz like what if you your last map
and you're as you're say you're at 511,
and you're as you're say you're at 511,
right? Then your last map will only have
right? Then your last map will only have
like one agent that is actively getting
like one agent that is actively getting
there. Would that
there. Would that
not screw with that? No, it'll just
not screw with that? No, it'll just
screw with the logs for that one map.
Okay. Which I guess arguably across the
Okay. Which I guess arguably across the
512, however many maps it ends up being
512, however many maps it ends up being
from should be a fairly small. Well,
from should be a fairly small. Well,
it's not trivial because the thing is
it's not trivial because the thing is
you'll get stuck at like 99% instead of
you'll get stuck at like 99% instead of
99.9 or whatever. And that actually is a
99.9 or whatever. And that actually is a
distinction that matters. Well, I think
distinction that matters. Well, I think
we should do something like that because
we should do something like that because
training on the same 75 maps and like
training on the same 75 maps and like
replicated across 16 cores is not good.
Yeah. I mean, ideally, we need to be
Yeah. I mean, ideally, we need to be
able to make it so it's across 10,000
able to make it so it's across 10,000
maps to get it to be comparable. Well,
maps to get it to be comparable. Well,
but then we have to have we have to fix
but then we have to have we have to fix
the shape errors, right? Like because
the shape errors, right? Like because
the shapes have to match.
the shapes have to match.
Yeah, they did map resampling.
I don't even know if they needed to do
I don't even know if they needed to do
that, but yeah.
I think they they changed maps every

Yeah. So, anyways, welcome. We are uh
Yeah. So, anyways, welcome. We are uh
we're live now. Let's do be taking a
we're live now. Let's do be taking a
look at GPU drive stuff. Spencer here.
look at GPU drive stuff. Spencer here.
Um okay. Why don't you send me over the
Um okay. Why don't you send me over the
latest stuff and we will take a
look. I also think I fixed sweeps uh in
look. I also think I fixed sweeps uh in
the brief period after after those
the brief period after after those
calls. So hopefully we actually have
calls. So hopefully we actually have
that stuff working
again pretty
again pretty
good. All right. Uh, let me go ahead and
good. All right. Uh, let me go ahead and
drop you a recent link. And it looks
drop you a recent link. And it looks
like it's kind of doing [ __ ] So, all
like it's kind of doing [ __ ] So, all
right.
[Music]
Okay. The episode return is weird, but
Okay. The episode return is weird, but
the scorecard is going up. So, we'll see
the scorecard is going up. So, we'll see
if that's just a matter of my login
if that's just a matter of my login
weird.
weird.
This one you just linked
This one you just linked
or what? All right, here we go.
or what? All right, here we go.
642 1B.
Yeah, that one. This one.
Yeah, that one. This one.
Um, hold up. Let me put up your stream
Um, hold up. Let me put up your stream
on my screen so I can see what you're
on my screen so I can see what you're
looking at.
looking at.
Oh, yeah. That's way better. Cool.
Oh, yeah. That's way better. Cool.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See, it's do
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See, it's do
it's doing things. Is this with
it's doing things. Is this with
collisions on or not? What is this? This
collisions on or not? What is this? This
is with collisions on. Weirdly enough,
is with collisions on. Weirdly enough,
with collisions off, it can't learn
with collisions off, it can't learn
anything.
anything.
Huh.
Huh.
Interesting. Because all it does, it
Interesting. Because all it does, it
just respawns back in where it starts.
just respawns back in where it starts.
And it's like, what? What the [ __ ] just
And it's like, what? What the [ __ ] just
happened to me?
It should still be able to learn stuff
It should still be able to learn stuff
from that if it's getting the collision
from that if it's getting the collision
reward. But that's weird. Yeah. Yeah, I
reward. But that's weird. Yeah. Yeah, I
mean the collision reward to be getting
mean the collision reward to be getting
is zero if it's if you set it the
is zero if it's if you set it the
penalty zero, but Oh, I see. But it it
penalty zero, but Oh, I see. But it it
respawns and it doesn't get a reward and
respawns and it doesn't get a reward and
it doesn't know like why like So then
it doesn't know like why like So then
yeah, that actually makes sense then.
yeah, that actually makes sense then.
Oh, great universe. Why did I just get
Oh, great universe. Why did I just get
located to a random place? Yep, that's
located to a random place? Yep, that's
fine. So, uh I mean this then is better
fine. So, uh I mean this then is better
than we had before without collision but
than we had before without collision but
with collisions, right?
with collisions, right?
This
This
is right now for sure better than before
is right now for sure better than before
without
without
collisions and especially in terms of
collisions and especially in terms of
like speed because we had a speed issue,
like speed because we had a speed issue,
right? Um the off-road rate is probably
right? Um the off-road rate is probably
some of the best I have this far. Now
some of the best I have this far. Now
the true test is to see whether this
the true test is to see whether this
actually eval. So that's yet to be
actually eval. So that's yet to be
determined. It still has another two
determined. It still has another two
minutes to go on this run. Okay. I mean,
minutes to go on this run. Okay. I mean,
and also sometimes if it if it dips
and also sometimes if it if it dips
towards the end, uh, cosign and nailing,
towards the end, uh, cosign and nailing,
there's um there's some stuff I need to
there's um there's some stuff I need to
look at with that. I don't think I'm
look at with that. I don't think I'm
doing it right.
doing it right.
Uh, one thing that's for sure weird that
Uh, one thing that's for sure weird that
I've noticed after running longer
I've noticed after running longer
experiments is it is almost a guarantee
experiments is it is almost a guarantee
that if you get to around like 500
that if you get to around like 500
million steps, the entropy just does
million steps, the entropy just does
some weird stuff.
some weird stuff.
like it'll just like drop like a rock
like it'll just like drop like a rock
and then your policy will start doing
and then your policy will start doing
weird things and then it'll like try and
weird things and then it'll like try and
recover entropy again and then it'll
recover entropy again and then it'll
like go back to learning again.
like go back to learning again.
Yeah, that's so I don't know what's up
Yeah, that's so I don't know what's up
with that. I don't know either. It is
with that. I don't know either. It is
something that I've
something that I've
noticed. All right. So, uh we got
noticed. All right. So, uh we got
entropy, we got
entropy, we got
score,
score,
and I mean we'll see which of these
and I mean we'll see which of these
don't work. Is this all already after
don't work. Is this all already after
filtering or no?
Like they had a they had filtering stuff
Like they had a they had filtering stuff
for like invalid cars and goals and
for like invalid cars and goals and
stuff, didn't they?
stuff, didn't they?
Yeah. So, this has a a decent amount of
Yeah. So, this has a a decent amount of
that in terms of like a bunch of cleanup
that in terms of like a bunch of cleanup
on the maps. But, weirdly enough, even
on the maps. But, weirdly enough, even
after all the
after all the
cleanup, they so they did some cleanup
cleanup, they so they did some cleanup
on the levels that I downloaded, right?
on the levels that I downloaded, right?
But even with post their cleanup, I have
But even with post their cleanup, I have
some cleanup after that. and it's still
some cleanup after that. and it's still
not perfectly clean. So, I was trying to
not perfectly clean. So, I was trying to
set up
set up
um their original actual just GPU drive
um their original actual just GPU drive
project, but funny enough because I like
project, but funny enough because I like
I just bought the new box. Um it's not
I just bought the new box. Um it's not
compatible because CUDA that's um on 124
compatible because CUDA that's um on 124
and that's funny can only use 129 CUDA
and that's funny can only use 129 CUDA
or whatever without 128. Yeah, that's
or whatever without 128. Yeah, that's
funny.
funny.
So, I wanted to look at the I wanted if
So, I wanted to look at the I wanted if
you could do that, that would be really
you could do that, that would be really
helpful is if you could pull up a map
helpful is if you could pull up a map
that can render on their end because
that can render on their end because
that's the one thing that I'd be trippy
that's the one thing that I'd be trippy
about because my end was still showing
about because my end was still showing
that if you run through the expert
that if you run through the expert
trajectories Mhm. there's still
trajectories Mhm. there's still
collisions in off-road, but it should be
collisions in off-road, but it should be
zero because otherwise your optimal
zero because otherwise your optimal
trajectory has [ __ ] going on.
trajectory has [ __ ] going on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um,
Um,
well that's funny.
well that's funny.
Do they not have like they don't have
Do they not have like they don't have
like onload filtering? They don't have
like onload filtering? They don't have
like any like runtime other shenanigans.
like any like runtime other shenanigans.
Um, I mean from what I've seen I mean
Um, I mean from what I've seen I mean
I've asked them quite a few questions on
I've asked them quite a few questions on
the subject of it and you know it seems
the subject of it and you know it seems
like they I have reviewed it that they
like they I have reviewed it that they
are doing a good amount of filtering and
are doing a good amount of filtering and
cleaning up ahead of it. Mhm. Um, and I
cleaning up ahead of it. Mhm. Um, and I
just added one of the things that was
just added one of the things that was
not the same where I subtract the mean
not the same where I subtract the mean
to all the
to all the
positions and I was seeing if that did
positions and I was seeing if that did
anything with learning, but it turns out
anything with learning, but it turns out
that's just a camera trick so that all
that's just a camera trick so that all
the maps origin stays at zero.
Um, okay. So, it just finished. It got
Um, okay. So, it just finished. It got
93% score. Let me see what happens if I
93% score. Let me see what happens if I
try and eval the map.
try and eval the map.
Should be able to like see some cool
Should be able to like see some cool
stuff happening, right?
stuff happening, right?
You would think so at 90 something%.
You would think so at 90 something%.
It should be at least like decent.
Eval for this is really annoying though
Eval for this is really annoying though
I have to say because of the way I've
I have to say because of the way I've
set it up
set it up
um of the fact that like each env in it
um of the fact that like each env in it
is an independent
map. When you do roll out you can only
map. When you do roll out you can only
roll out one map.
roll out one map.
So the way that we do it that I do it by
So the way that we do it that I do it by
default with all the M's is we just
default with all the M's is we just
render the first one and call it a day.
Sure. And I mean like that's fine, but
Sure. And I mean like that's fine, but
like it'd be nice if on this it would
like it'd be nice if on this it would
for specifically this type of thing
for specifically this type of thing
whenever it's running you can like have
whenever it's running you can like have
it jump to another map.
it jump to another map.
Yeah, you can do that potentially. You'd
Yeah, you can do that potentially. You'd
have to add the key binds.
All right. Actually, that's that's all
All right. Actually, that's that's all
you'd have to do is add the key binds
you'd have to do is add the key binds
and you could just tap over maps.
and you could just tap over maps.
Well, no, because you have to
Well, no, because you have to
reinitialize the map. Why do you have to
reinitialize the map. Why do you have to
reinitialize the map? Because
reinitialize the map? Because
each each of the ends is only getting
each each of the ends is only getting
that map to play with.
that map to play with.
Yeah. So, the way that that works
Yeah. So, the way that that works
though, right, is that the map has a
though, right, is that the map has a
client, right? And the client has a
client, right? And the client has a
render function and you just need to

know which one actually has to call

if you set up a Oh, I guess I see
if you set up a Oh, I guess I see

correct.

Correct. That's why it's a little funky.
Correct. That's why it's a little funky.
Yeah. Okay. Well, we'll figure something
Yeah. Okay. Well, we'll figure something
with that. But I mean, that's just stuff
with that. But I mean, that's just stuff
for later. I mean, it's not like dire,

Uhhuh. That is a car going to a goal.
Why are there cars just like in the
Why are there cars just like in the

Why does it like move so
wiggly? Dynamics

Okay, we should fix
that. I mean, it works though,
right? It's actually It's screwing up
right? It's actually It's screwing up
occasionally because of the

That's
weird. Yeah. So, this should be very

easy.
easy.
Um, we're going to have to look at the
Um, we're going to have to look at the
action space and stuff and maybe like

try to drive the cars.
One more back to training. We can do one
One more back to training. We can do one
more real quick and then we will go back

to uh looking at it. I have some

or the other?
There's a
There's a
straight. Why the cars are damn wiggly
then? It should learn. If it just stops
then? It should learn. If it just stops
wiggling so much, it'll do better.
It's randomly disappearing

just did. So I'm a little curious to

know. Um, but if there's other things,
do you want me to push this right now so
do you want me to push this right now so
that you can do stuff while Sure.
Okay. Well, I think you have to PR it
Okay. Well, I think you have to PR it
technically, right? Yeah, I'm have to PR

freaking cars.
Yeah. What?
Yeah. What?
I think those cars are marked experts
I think those cars are marked experts

Um you know, it doesn't have to be 75,
Um you know, it doesn't have to be 75,
right? It it can be like I think up to
right? It it can be like I think up to
512 I want to say, but then the batch
512 I want to say, but then the batch
size increases a bunch and it's slow. So
size increases a bunch and it's slow. So
I have to replicate that over all the
I have to replicate that over all the
different different cores. Okay. Which
different different cores. Okay. Which

Well, the quickest thing to make it
Well, the quickest thing to make it
faster is just to reduce the
faster is just to reduce the
ops. But I don't know if you want to
ops. But I don't know if you want to
start with that.
start with that.
You know, we'll consider it.
because you have to remember so
because you have to remember so
originally I I was only using road edges
originally I I was only using road edges
as part of the ops but then I decided to
as part of the ops but then I decided to
throw in the whole thing so that it
throw in the whole thing so that it
matches the GPU drive actual project
matches the GPU drive actual project
where they're looking at like lanes and
where they're looking at like lanes and
lines

and all the other classifications of

roads but in reality the model only

cares about road edges.

What does Puffer Lib do? Is it like
What does Puffer Lib do? Is it like
PyTorch for RL? We use PyTorch, but

yeah, we try to make reinforcement
yeah, we try to make reinforcement
learning really, really fast and really,
learning really, really fast and really,
really simple. And the thing is it's not
really simple. And the thing is it's not
quite like PyTorch because the key thing
quite like PyTorch because the key thing
that's difficult about RL is you need to
that's difficult about RL is you need to
run a bunch of environments really
run a bunch of environments really
really fast and get data from them in a

very tight loop. That is the thing
that's hard. Also your models tend to be
that's hard. Also your models tend to be
very small. When your models are small,
very small. When your models are small,
little bits of overhead matter way more.
little bits of overhead matter way more.
It's like so much easier to like
It's like so much easier to like
optimize overhead on a language model

versus like a little tiny RLN net. thing

that's hard with language models is like
that's hard with language models is like
actually getting your getting your GPUs
actually getting your getting your GPUs
saturated with good kernels and stuff
saturated with good kernels and stuff
and then all the distributed stuff is a

nightmare. But like you know you little
nightmare. But like you know you little
bits of Python code you write on top of
bits of Python code you write on top of
that doesn't matter because the language
that doesn't matter because the language
model's way slower in RL everything

matters.
Yeah, the whole starting at 50% score is
Yeah, the whole starting at 50% score is
really sussing me out.
I don't know how that's really

right
because that that means that well

actually it could be that um if there's

some agents that are basically on top of
some agents that are basically on top of
their goal right they're just going to
their goal right they're just going to
get it constantly distance is two two
get it constantly distance is two two
meters is like what's considered and I
meters is like what's considered and I
know that there are some goals that are
know that there are some goals that are
within like if two is the minimum
within like if two is the minimum

that are sub five which is one square on
that are sub five which is one square on

the thing. So, you just like hit forward
and you get it. Yeah, basically. Well, I
and you get it. Yeah, basically. Well, I
mean, that could account for it, right?

Cuz it just does that repeatedly. But,
Cuz it just does that repeatedly. But,
weirdly, I didn't see that on my

just couldn't figure it out. But you
just couldn't figure it out. But you
didn't see that. What? This is with the
didn't see that. What? This is with the

a 91st step segment. You could modify
a 91st step segment. You could modify
this score metric so they still get
this score metric so they still get
their reward, but the score they only
their reward, but the score they only
get at most once per episode if you want
get at most once per episode if you want
to keep it consistent with the original.
Could do that. Um, but then don't I have
Could do that. Um, but then don't I have
to change how ad log works or No, no,
to change how ad log works or No, no,
just when you call it.
Well, I guess I already Okay, so I call
Well, I guess I already Okay, so I call
ad
ad
log when they get the goal, when they
log when they get the goal, when they
hit something, and also at the end of
hit something, and also at the end of
the 91st step segment before
the 91st step segment before
resetting because I fig the three
resetting because I fig the three
conditions in which the world. Yeah. So
conditions in which the world. Yeah. So
instead of doing that basically, right,
instead of doing that basically, right,
you would just log once at 91 with did
you would just log once at 91 with did
it ever get the

man. Yeah, I already have. Yeah, I
man. Yeah, I already have. Yeah, I
already have gold this episode. Or are
already have gold this episode. Or are
you just reading the code?

No, I just am guessing. Oh, no. That's

Um like log
Um like log

million steps right now? 200.
Uh, what' you say? I'm at 200.
Uh, what' you say? I'm at 200.
I think it took them how many steps?
I think it took them how many steps?
Like 500 million.
I think that's for more m

They're at like well yes they are doing
They're at like well yes they are doing
way more so to be I don't know if that's
way more so to be I don't know if that's
easier. I think it was harder generally
easier. I think it was harder generally
or it was it was more stable. It's for

Now I'm hovering at like 94 95. Okay,
Now I'm hovering at like 94 95. Okay,
we'll see. I will say I did get a very
we'll see. I will say I did get a very
nice log linear. So what I did for
nice log linear. So what I did for
reference, the thing that I did uh I
reference, the thing that I did uh I
changed it to just under like
changed it to just under like
8192 m. So I I took it down to 64 maps
8192 m. So I I took it down to 64 maps
and uh I upped it to 16 workers. You get
and uh I upped it to 16 workers. You get
a total of like 8192. So M goes to 1%.
a total of like 8192. So M goes to 1%.
And uh I set the BPT or I set the

exactly.
So you're training on mini batches of
So you're training on mini batches of
full
full
rollouts. Oh, that's
clever. All right. All right. I'm like
clever. All right. All right. I'm like
getting a little bit stuck, but I'm at
getting a little bit stuck, but I'm at
95%.
95%.
It did kind of well it evened out at the

Let me let me link you the one the
Let me let me link you the one the
current run I'm going
after built this we retrain with your

new changes and we see if the punch and
new changes and we see if the punch and
face reward not punching face reward is

better.
All right. I just linked you my current
All right. I just linked you my current

I'll do that.
I'll do that.
But it does look like it's whole it's
But it does look like it's whole it's
kind of getting stuck now at 95.
kind of getting stuck now at 95.
95 is better than you've seen, right? 95
95 is better than you've seen, right? 95
is definitely better than I've seen
is definitely better than I've seen
without a question.
without a question.
So, as I said, you fixed the dumb asking
So, as I said, you fixed the dumb asking
thing. Yeah. Yeah. I to be fair though I

think probably it is getting a little
think probably it is getting a little

There is some amount of upper bound due
There is some amount of upper bound due
to that problem. Now, as to what it is
to that problem. Now, as to what it is
statistically, I have no not a single
clip. Well, now we're trending at
280. My off-road rate is now at a pretty
280. My off-road rate is now at a pretty
good situation. It's less than 1%.
good situation. It's less than 1%.
which means it's fully deter learned
which means it's fully deter learned
that don't hit a curb.
that don't hit a curb.
Does it reset on off-road or no? Yes, it
Does it reset on off-road or no? Yes, it
does
both off-road and
both off-road and

We could just see if this changes the
We could just see if this changes the
curve at all.
My curve is just a is basically just on
My curve is just a is basically just on
top of the other

clean this thing looks now.
clean this thing looks now.
All right. Look at
this self-driving. Yeah. So, this is an
this self-driving. Yeah. So, this is an
N. Uh, so this is based on an N by NYU,
N. Uh, so this is based on an N by NYU,
which is a GPU accelerated driving sim.
which is a GPU accelerated driving sim.
Spencer here ported it to Puffer Lib on
Spencer here ported it to Puffer Lib on
CPU and made it faster. So now we have
CPU and made it faster. So now we have
our own uh our own sim that's like
our own uh our own sim that's like
really fast that we can run tons of
really fast that we can run tons of
experiments on. So we're trying to
experiments on. So we're trying to
basically make uh a better version of
basically make uh a better version of
NYU's sim so that they can use it for
NYU's sim so that they can use it for
their research. We can do cool stuff
their research. We can do cool stuff
with it in Puffer Lib and everyone's
with it in Puffer Lib and everyone's
happy. All right. My my thing just
happy. All right. My my thing just
stopped at
96%. It spiked at the last second to get
96%. It spiked at the last second to get
like a lucky run.
like a lucky run.
Well, it can't spike at the end because
Well, it can't spike at the end because
um so that the last section if you look
um so that the last section if you look
there should be like an extra data point
there should be like an extra data point
at the end
at the end
and that is from we do like a full eval
and that is from we do like a full eval
or like we do a longer eval at the end.
or like we do a longer eval at the end.
So the last metric should not be the
So the last metric should not be the
lucky one. It's actually the more
lucky one. It's actually the more
accurate one.
the one at like the one B reports at the
the one at like the one B reports at the
very end,
very end,
you should see like a flat line or
you should see like a flat line or
whatever, like a flat line segment at
whatever, like a flat line segment at
the end. So that flat line segment, all
the end. So that flat line segment, all
those steps in there are compressed into
those steps in there are compressed into
that last data point.
that last data point.
This is an intentional thing with Puffer
This is an intentional thing with Puffer
so that we get accurate evals. All
so that we get accurate evals. All
right. Well, I'm going to download this
right. Well, I'm going to download this
model and see how it
eval. You see, let's show off the
eval. You see, let's show off the
self-driving
self-driving
sim a little bit for a stream. So, this
sim a little bit for a stream. So, this
is it. Now, the these cars aren't doing
is it. Now, the these cars aren't doing
anything. We're going to have to load in
anything. We're going to have to load in
a policy to see them do anything. But,
a policy to see them do anything. But,
uh yeah, you know, you can load in
uh yeah, you know, you can load in
actual real world maps selected. I think

switch to a different car.
Yeah. Yeah. If you hold Yeah. If you
Yeah. Yeah. If you hold Yeah. If you
hold control, it puts it in that mode.
hold control, it puts it in that mode.
And if you hold if you hold shift
And if you hold if you hold shift
um you you can use the arrow keys. So if
um you you can use the arrow keys. So if
you use the arrow keys, it'll increment
you use the arrow keys, it'll increment
your acceleration or your um steering by
your acceleration or your um steering by
one just based off the index of its
one just based off the index of its
position. So if you go to like
position. So if you go to like
acceleration, okay, well that's going to
acceleration, okay, well that's going to
really hurt your brain. But what is
really hurt your brain. But what is
this?
this?
Uh you're going in a circle right now
Uh you're going in a circle right now
because you're steering. So go on the
because you're steering. So go on the
press right arrow a few times so you get
press right arrow a few times so you get
your steering to around
six and once you get to a steering of
six and once you get to a steering of
six should be going in a straight fine.
This is uh probably a bad time to
This is uh probably a bad time to
mention. Uh I actually don't have a
mention. Uh I actually don't have a

making RL ludicrously better in very

as um in Eval it's like rapidly flying

back and forth on numbers. So it just
back and forth on numbers. So it just
effectively was sitting still because it

It could be that it just decided screw

I no longer want to deal with it. Yeah.
I no longer want to deal with it. Yeah.
I mean, that's what that the NYU team
I mean, that's what that the NYU team
talked about a lot in their in their

it should be doing
better. All right. Well, you could try
better. All right. Well, you could try
decreasing the collision uh the
decreasing the collision uh the
collision penalty.

Yeah, try that. It was weird. At zero,
Yeah, try that. It was weird. At zero,
it did nothing. But maybe if it's really

Well, yeah. Zero. It's not

That's try negative0.25.
That's try negative0.25.
I've done five already and that would

5 percentage collision rate makes sense,

What's DNF rate?

Yes, I would. Yeah. So, you got like I

Oh, give it a minute. Then we just got

we It's probably just to shut up and

so we can like use the fixes in there

and like run a proper sweep.

Um, yeah, I'm fine with that. It

Well, I don't know what the difference

into whatever puffer drive branch this
is. Well, I'm at 96 now, too. But it's

Has yours gone to 97 at all or no?
No.
Finally, we do want a completion rate

then ship it to you.
Arguably it should just happen at the

Mhm. I question how that's 96%. It's

Fine. All right, I'm putting in a

also. Mine hit 97.
We'll we'll find out if it holds it,
compile some

put the completion rate to be set at the

If you set completion rate be like did

I set that to one if that agent hits its

that should be the completion rate.
that should be the completion rate.
Right. It depends when you add log. It

you add a log in, right, that's like

I can't add log multiple times prior to

Uh, no, not really.

Okay. Well, I made it I made training

Wait, but then why would I need a

I'm going to recompile with the uh with

Okay. I'm at like 35 right now. All
Okay. I'm at like 35 right now. All

Why isn't it real 93? We got some log

first on Grock plays Pokemon.
Can we get that guy to just like go run
Can we get that guy to just like go run
uh run the thing on Pokemon Blue real
uh run the thing on Pokemon Blue real
quick so we can say like, "Hey, also if
quick so we can say like, "Hey, also if
we beat both games, do you beat both
we beat both games, do you beat both
games?" It would be
fun. Gork plays
Pokemon. All
right, I'm now at a mean
40%. I honestly don't know what would be
40%. I honestly don't know what would be
more stressful in that guy's life. like
more stressful in that guy's life. like
literally being on Grock or on X 24/7 or
literally being on Grock or on X 24/7 or
running six companies. It's like that's
running six companies. It's like that's
kind of a toss up in my
book. Uh we are at 95% with the default
book. Uh we are at 95% with the default
policy.
kind of amusing honestly.
Like I It really shouldn't be any
better. Like like even speed
wise. I thought it should be better
wise. I thought it should be better
because max pooling is an expensive
because max pooling is an expensive

Why would max be an expensive operation?

I thought we talked about it last time

uh you now
have the first network of your input and
have the first network of your input and
then you're running through another

different that was a totally different

context though for that.
So it's if you do if you run the full
So it's if you do if you run the full
size layer on each and then you max pull

then yeah but it's supposed to be like a

So yeah, this uh default policy
So yeah, this uh default policy
literally does the same
literally does the same
thing and is faster. There.
All right, I'm now getting stuck at like
All right, I'm now getting stuck at like
43%.
I mean that's more
I mean that's more
reasonable like to what we saw in the

would so actually here's the

Okay. Right. I would generally hope so,
Okay. Right. I would generally hope so,
but I mean default policy is doing

I mean, every time I've checked it's
I mean, every time I've checked it's
fine, but because one time I would like
fine, but because one time I would like
I actually change the observation just
I actually change the observation just

For sure. I think that whatever we have

Okay.
We're waiting for uh Are you starting?
Is it starting to rise now?
Yep. Yeah. As soon as tariffs are out,
Yep. Yeah. As soon as tariffs are out,
hopefully we just get a whole bunch of
hopefully we just get a whole bunch of

I mean, the fact that this is at least
I mean, the fact that this is at least
going up means we can probably sweep it
going up means we can probably sweep it
to see how much is in the
hypers. And then from
hypers. And then from
there, the thing that's annoying is that
there, the thing that's annoying is that
the hyper prim sweep is not in the best
the hyper prim sweep is not in the best

So, if we get this into the release
So, if we get this into the release
branch and my other hyper pram sweeps
branch and my other hyper pram sweeps
are good, then what we can do from that
probably. See, are they any
probably. See, are they any
good the first
good the first
run? Hang
run? Hang
on. Oh, no. Okay, that's good. Yeah, we
on. Oh, no. Okay, that's good. Yeah, we
are getting stuff.
Uh, no. It's I'm looking at this is this
Uh, no. It's I'm looking at this is this
is a totally different thing. This is
is a totally different thing. This is
hyper pram sweeps for uh mazes. Um Oh,
hyper pram sweeps for uh mazes. Um Oh,
nice. But yeah, this looks like our
nice. But yeah, this looks like our
hyper pram sweeps at least doing
hyper pram sweeps at least doing
something reasonable. Like if you get
something reasonable. Like if you get
this into the release branch, we can run
this into the release branch, we can run
that hyper pram sweep on it and then
that hyper pram sweep on it and then
that should at least tell us if there's
that should at least tell us if there's
like some alpha left in this
thing,
thing,
right? Yeah, that would be good. And
right? Yeah, that would be good. And
then like and then we'll know if it's
then like and then we'll know if it's
the hypers or not. And then uh it's
the hypers or not. And then uh it's
probably going to be like data problem.
probably going to be like data problem.
It's like always data problem.
Okay.
Okay.
And we can So is the release branch just
And we can So is the release branch just
called like release right now or? Yes.
called like release right now or? Yes.
Okay. It's you're going to see like I've
Okay. It's you're going to see like I've
it's I've done crazy things with it, but
it's I've done crazy things with it, but
none of it should make it particularly
none of it should make it particularly
difficult to do anything with the M's.
difficult to do anything with the M's.
Um, I'm just like doing tons of things
Um, I'm just like doing tons of things
trying to get it ready for the
release. Look how few files we have in
release. Look how few files we have in
here. Oops. This is in
here. Oops. This is in
20 and this is in release. I guess we
20 and this is in release. I guess we
still have a bunch. It's fewer
still have a bunch. It's fewer
though. Like minus
five. Okay. I can't do anything about
five. Okay. I can't do anything about
all the cuda and stuff.
Okay, then. Okay, I'll try and get it
Okay, then. Okay, I'll try and get it
into
into
release. I presume whatever you have in
release. I presume whatever you have in

the general chat. Either way, you can do
that either
way. That's what I did. So, I I mapped

it so that it would be aligned with the

uh episode

That's where mine got stuck at. I don't
That's where mine got stuck at. I don't

to say.

sims are cool. I don't really know if
sims are cool. I don't really know if
there's anything to do with RL in them,
there's anything to do with RL in them,
but they're cool.
Okay. Um, I'm gonna head off for tonight
and I'll get that thing signed to you in
and I'll get that thing signed to you in
the morning. Yep. So, I Yeah, that'll be
the morning. Yep. So, I Yeah, that'll be
good. So, I will send that stuff over
good. So, I will send that stuff over
and then I think that the goal for the
and then I think that the goal for the
GPU drive stuff. The best thing we can
GPU drive stuff. The best thing we can
do is just get into release so that we
do is just get into release so that we
can like keep running stuff as we get
can like keep running stuff as we get
closer to release. We'll do a full
closer to release. We'll do a full
sweep, right? We can easily set up a
sweep, right? We can easily set up a
full sweep. Once we have that, you'll
full sweep. Once we have that, you'll
have access to all the latest stuff on
have access to all the latest stuff on
it way more easily. And
it way more easily. And
um it's probably a data problem is my
um it's probably a data problem is my
guess. Yeah. Like I don't see how it
guess. Yeah. Like I don't see how it
wouldn't be. It's not that hard of a
wouldn't be. It's not that hard of a
problem.
It's not that hard of a learning problem
It's not that hard of a learning problem
compared to other stuff. I mean, heck,
compared to other stuff. I mean, heck,
even the maze solving should be harder
even the maze solving should be harder
than this, right?
than this, right?
Yeah. I mean, I I even think that the
Yeah. I mean, I I even think that the
tower climb environment should be
tower climb environment should be
harder. I mean,
and we're just like we're in space like
and we're just like we're in space like
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean, a sequential movement. Yeah.
I mean, a sequential movement. Yeah.
There has to be something. Yeah. So, I'm
There has to be something. Yeah. So, I'm
certain I'm going to be really pissed
certain I'm going to be really pissed
off if when we do find it, though. We
off if when we do find it, though. We
should figure out how to get more of
should figure out how to get more of
these things loaded in as well. Um, more
these things loaded in as well. Um, more
of these maps loaded in. You know, like
of these maps loaded in. You know, like
Spencer, it could literally just be as
Spencer, it could literally just be as
simple as like you pick a number of
simple as like you pick a number of
agents and then you load maps until you

hit that number and you toss the ones
hit that number and you toss the ones
that are go over
that are go over
it. Like, it could be as easy as that.
it. Like, it could be as easy as that.
And then we could randomize the maps. Do
And then we could randomize the maps. Do
we get actually good domain
randomization? That's like trivial,
randomization? That's like trivial,
right?
Yeah, but you're gonna miss out on
Yeah, but you're gonna miss out on
certain maps. No. Or are you going to
certain maps. No. Or are you going to
just try and get it always under your
just try and get it always under your
optimal number because not every map
optimal number because not every map
combo is going to get you to Yeah, just
combo is going to get you to Yeah, just
under like o over either way. So like we
under like o over either way. So like we
specify, let's say we want 512 uh cars
specify, let's say we want 512 uh cars
per worker. So five like per core. We
per worker. So five like per core. We
just make maps until we have 512 of
just make maps until we have 512 of
them. And like they don't have to be the
them. And like they don't have to be the
first end maps anymore either. You just
first end maps anymore either. You just
pick whatever ones until you get to 512
pick whatever ones until you get to 512
total agents. Let's say you get to 520
total agents. Let's say you get to 520
agents, you overshoot. You just drop the
agents, you overshoot. You just drop the
last eight. You don't give them actions
last eight. You don't give them actions
or
anything. Is the dropping part weird?
anything. Is the dropping part weird?
Like how does inside of the actual code?
Like how does inside of the actual code?
No, you just don't give them actions or
No, you just don't give them actions or
you just
I mean it'll muck up the the solve score
I mean it'll muck up the the solve score
by 1%.
Yeah, cuz like what if you your last map
Yeah, cuz like what if you your last map
and you're as you're say you're at 511,
and you're as you're say you're at 511,
right? Then your last map will only have
right? Then your last map will only have
like one agent that is actively getting
like one agent that is actively getting
there. Would that
there. Would that
not screw with that? No, it'll just
not screw with that? No, it'll just
screw with the logs for that one map.
Okay. Which I guess arguably across the
Okay. Which I guess arguably across the
512, however many maps it ends up being
512, however many maps it ends up being
from should be a fairly small. Well,
from should be a fairly small. Well,
it's not trivial because the thing is
it's not trivial because the thing is
you'll get stuck at like 99% instead of
you'll get stuck at like 99% instead of
99.9 or whatever. And that actually is a
99.9 or whatever. And that actually is a
distinction that matters. Well, I think
distinction that matters. Well, I think
we should do something like that because
we should do something like that because
training on the same 75 maps and like
training on the same 75 maps and like
replicated across 16 cores is not good.
Yeah. I mean, ideally, we need to be
Yeah. I mean, ideally, we need to be
able to make it so it's across 10,000
able to make it so it's across 10,000
maps to get it to be comparable. Well,
maps to get it to be comparable. Well,
but then we have to have we have to fix
but then we have to have we have to fix
the shape errors, right? Like because
the shape errors, right? Like because
the shapes have to match.
the shapes have to match.
Yeah, they did map resampling.
I don't even know if they needed to do
I don't even know if they needed to do
that, but yeah.
I think they they changed maps every

like couple hundred million steps. I

Still not very great.
