um let's
see I think we're going to just try to
see I think we're going to just try to
finish up this environment
finish up this environment
today and uh see where we go from
today and uh see where we go from
here
yeah not this environment of
course hey bet
oops that the OS being
stupid seems
not interesting
no why does it not give me
a why the heck doesn't it give
me the uh the output for this is so
me the uh the output for this is so
weird
where's this where's this
segf oh something screwed up with
segf oh something screwed up with
uh okay that's interesting something
uh okay that's interesting something
actually screwed up with uh with the
actually screwed up with uh with the
renderer this is not the program
that's incredibly
interesting how's that happen I might
interesting how's that happen I might
have to reboot the machine I hope
have to reboot the machine I hope
not let me
not let me
see what if I just reboot the container
instead oh Isaac
tank I forgot I was using this

bro please use t-u that wouldn't fix
bro please use t-u that wouldn't fix
this particular
this particular

alive I don't use it for local

development there's no
development there's no
reason this is running this Docker is
reason this is running this Docker is
running on my local machine
let's see if this fixes the
let's see if this fixes the
uh there we
uh there we
go so here's one version of the
go so here's one version of the
M this is just our mini grid like
M this is just our mini grid like
version so we can move the puffer we can
version so we can move the puffer we can
go through the door cuz we got the key I
go through the door cuz we got the key I
don't have any assets for this yet you
don't have any assets for this yet you
can see if I don't have the key I can't
can see if I don't have the key I can't
go through the door these ones are open
go through the door these ones are open
so I can go through these ones here here
so I can go through these ones here here
and so on and so
and so on and so
forth
now we just replace this with this
and here we have our maze
environment so now we have to get to the
goal and this will reset and there we go
goal and this will reset and there we go
because we hit the
because we hit the
goal yeah exactly bet and now what we
goal yeah exactly bet and now what we
can do is we can go to say 31 by
31 but we can set the difficulty to zero
The seg Faults Are just my
OS and then we have a maze that looks
OS and then we have a maze that looks
like this which is a very easy maze
like this which is a very easy maze
isn't that
isn't that
interesting doesn't seem like it's going
interesting doesn't seem like it's going
to let me move the puffer in this one
to let me move the puffer in this one
for some
reason uh let's see if there's
why okay so for some reason it does not
why okay so for some reason it does not
let me move move the puffer I got to
let me move move the puffer I got to
figure that one out but you can see here
figure that one out but you can see here
is a big maze that's very easy you just
is a big maze that's very easy you just
go this way and then this way and there
go this way and then this way and there
you go and then we can make a big maze
you go and then we can make a big maze
that's very
hard how do you solve this one
hard how do you solve this one
huh this one's got uh some more
huh this one's got uh some more
branching and stuff to
it and then I go back to the default
it and then I go back to the default
which I set to
which I set to
0. 85 growing fre
0. 85 growing fre
algorithm well it's kind of hard to make
algorithm well it's kind of hard to make
a maze that's that
small and then this is the balanced
one it's hard to make a hard maze that
one it's hard to make a hard maze that
is uh this
small I can technically make this much
small I can technically make this much
larger bet
we'll just give you a maze that you can
we'll just give you a maze that you can
print out and you can use it as new
print out and you can use it as new
wallpaper for your you know your actual
wallpaper for your you know your actual
walls and then we'll see how easy that
walls and then we'll see how easy that
is that'll take you a
while uh replying to crypto Bots
while uh replying to crypto Bots
definitely
doesn't balance one seems
doesn't balance one seems
more hard but yeah it'll need to be
more hard but yeah it'll need to be
larger but here's the cool thing we're
larger but here's the cool thing we're
going to be able to train on many
going to be able to train on many
different map sizes at the same time
ah it takes some time you got to I mean
ah it takes some time you got to I mean
you got to post
you got to post
like actually good content in RL for the

part we are at 6746
I should
be should be in here somewhere
oh yeah this is a bot you just replied
oh yeah this is a bot you just replied
to there you go why do you

we'll show a couple cool things you can
we'll show a couple cool things you can

haven't read the paper

Dev it's a good time
Dev it's a good time
got lots of people doing cool stuff in
here all right so this inet doesn't need
here all right so this inet doesn't need
this it looks
like yeah this doesn't need all this
like yeah this doesn't need all this
mess look at
mess look at
this we just get rid of this this this
this Max size Ag and Horizon we going to
this Max size Ag and Horizon we going to
need this
nonsense here we go
I'm getting to that bet let me finish
I'm getting to that bet let me finish
this m this m is not just purely for fun
this m this m is not just purely for fun
there are also couple client things on
there are also couple client things on
this as
well not to mention we need it for
well not to mention we need it for
testing
that makes two of
us I've kind of realized that
us I've kind of realized that
um the speed at which puffer develops is
um the speed at which puffer develops is
basically going to just be a direct
basically going to just be a direct
function of the amount of hours of work
function of the amount of hours of work
that I can get out of myself and it
that I can get out of myself and it
might be super linear actually because
might be super linear actually because
the number of hours that I have uh to
the number of hours that I have uh to
actually Dev on stuff like this is equal
actually Dev on stuff like this is equal
to the total number of hours of Dev
to the total number of hours of Dev
minus the number of hours I have to
minus the number of hours I have to
spend on client stuff administrative
spend on client stuff administrative
stuff and other [ __ ] well the client
stuff and other [ __ ] well the client
stuff is good but other [ __ ] like
stuff is good but other [ __ ] like
the cluster breaking and such so um it
the cluster breaking and such so um it
can turn out that if I get a few more
can turn out that if I get a few more
hours out of myself puffer goes
hours out of myself puffer goes
dramatically
faster so the idea I have is to just
faster so the idea I have is to just
treat myself performance
treat myself performance

I'm trying with the new cluster okay
I'm trying with the new cluster okay
it's so almost all of the problems that
it's so almost all of the problems that
we've had with the cluster were not on
we've had with the cluster were not on
main gear they were on Intel it was
main gear they were on Intel it was
Intel shipping us bad
Intel shipping us bad
chips the one problem that we've had
chips the one problem that we've had
recently is that under uh a year of
recently is that under uh a year of
continuous load some of the cas and
continuous load some of the cas and
radiator fans have started
radiator fans have started
dying that is on main gear because they
dying that is on main gear because they
should ship higher quality fans that
should ship higher quality fans that
said we're getting the best fans in the
said we're getting the best fans in the
industry for the new machines so
not for these ones they aren't we are
not for these ones they aren't we are
getting knock for the new ones
are you getting
are you getting
industrial what do you mean
Reger and Def
Reger and Def
fans they have industrial fans let me
see is this a thing
what's the difference in the rating or
whatever well we don't need them to be
whatever well we don't need them to be
insanely fast we just need them to last
insanely fast we just need them to last
we just need them to be built to
last which to be fair I've literally
last which to be fair I've literally
never had problems with that so I assume
never had problems with that so I assume
it's just they were using super super
it's just they were using super super
cheap stock
fans I mean they got a cut money
fans I mean they got a cut money
somewhere their margins are pretty slim
somewhere their margins are pretty slim
like they get their prices have been

pretty
good we're looking at about 5,500 a box
good we're looking at about 5,500 a box
for the
for the
uh the 90s or
whatever 20 years
whatever 20 years
what about the uh the normal like the
what about the uh the normal like the
desktop
desktop
fans can we get like at least three to
fans can we get like at least three to
five years out of
them we should be able to right not to
them we should be able to right not to
are good
that's
funny the warehouse space is going to be
funny the warehouse space is going to be
pretty cool
all
ah okay so I messed this function up
ah okay so I messed this function up
we'll fix this so some of this grid
we'll fix this so some of this grid
prototype is super old code and I've
prototype is super old code and I've
just found better ways to do stuff since
just found better ways to do stuff since
then but here's the
then but here's the

10,000
10,000
mazes here this is State star levels
here is Neptune
here is Neptune
slow no Neptune takes a couple seconds
slow no Neptune takes a couple seconds
to initialize but then it shouldn't be
to initialize but then it shouldn't be
slow
well it depends what you're looking at
well it depends what you're looking at
the dashboard shouldn't be slow yeah if
the dashboard shouldn't be slow yeah if
you go look at the charts for this
you go look at the charts for this
number of points it's going to be slow
number of points it's going to be slow
but the dashboard should be
good I don't know you want to go replace
good I don't know you want to go replace
Neptune and WBY by rewriting them in C
if you're on mine which I think is
if you're on mine which I think is
public right up
public right up
here and then you click this
tab
for e
that sounds like uh some skill
that sounds like uh some skill
issue look into that that's pretty
serious I'm messing with you UI is a
serious I'm messing with you UI is a
little silly
1K there shouldn't be 1K you got to go
1K there shouldn't be 1K you got to go
to the grouping I showed you this right
to the grouping I showed you this right
you go here you got to set tag to uh
you go here you got to set tag to uh
here I'll show
here I'll show
you so this is just all the
you so this is just all the
runs you go to
runs you go to
group tags and you get some good
group tags and you get some good
runs it's not going to render a th000
runs it's not going to render a th000
anyways it'll stop you before it does
that should only do 20
that should only do 20
Max oh unless 1K they might have upped
Max oh unless 1K they might have upped
the total that would be cool did they up
the total that would be cool did they up
the

total
wait nope still 200
okay now all we got to do is make the
maze so we just do
maze so we just do
create maze
level size by size
unit the

Paro front tells you it's just a plot of
Paro front tells you it's just a plot of

of two variables is all and you can see
that the curve like the top curve is the
that the curve like the top curve is the
best of each know for for every price X
best of each know for for every price X
what's the best score
what's the best score
y now it depends on which one you're
y now it depends on which one you're
looking at this one here is is not well
looking at this one here is is not well
this one has Paro on running time versus
this one has Paro on running time versus
score so the parito front is like this
score so the parito front is like this
curve right at the top right but then
curve right at the top right but then
there's more stuff right so this is not
there's more stuff right so this is not
a Paro front of any type this is just
a Paro front of any type this is just
showing you how cost changes as you
showing you how cost changes as you
continue to run the sweep right so we
continue to run the sweep right so we
have stuff like this as
well
well
yeah dashboards are good you should
yeah dashboards are good you should
probably set your own version of that
probably set your own version of that
type of stuff up it's good we like a
type of stuff up it's good we like a
Neptune
should be

yes at that state was good

yeah not this environment of

oops that the OS being

not interesting
no why does it not give me
a why the heck doesn't it give

uh there we
go so here's one version of the

go through the door cuz we got the key I
go through the door cuz we got the key I
don't have any assets for this yet you

go through the door these ones are open
so I can go through these ones here here
so I can go through these ones here here
and so on and so
and so on and so
forth
now we just replace this with this
and here we have our maze
environment so now we have to get to the
goal and this will reset and there we go
goal and this will reset and there we go
because we hit the
because we hit the
goal yeah exactly bet and now what we
goal yeah exactly bet and now what we
can do is we can go to say 31 by
31 but we can set the difficulty to zero
The seg Faults Are just my
OS and then we have a maze that looks
OS and then we have a maze that looks
like this which is a very easy maze
like this which is a very easy maze
isn't that
isn't that
interesting doesn't seem like it's going

to let me move the puffer in this one
to let me move the puffer in this one
for some

why okay so for some reason it does not
let me move move the puffer I got to
let me move move the puffer I got to
figure that one out but you can see here
figure that one out but you can see here
is a big maze that's very easy you just
is a big maze that's very easy you just
go this way and then this way and there
go this way and then this way and there
you go and then we can make a big maze
you go and then we can make a big maze
that's very
hard how do you solve this one
hard how do you solve this one
huh this one's got uh some more

algorithm well it's kind of hard to make
algorithm well it's kind of hard to make
a maze that's that
small and then this is the balanced
one it's hard to make a hard maze that
one it's hard to make a hard maze that
is uh this
small I can technically make this much
small I can technically make this much
larger bet
we'll just give you a maze that you can
we'll just give you a maze that you can
print out and you can use it as new
print out and you can use it as new

walls and then we'll see how easy that
is that'll take you a

while uh replying to crypto Bots
definitely
doesn't balance one seems
doesn't balance one seems
more hard but yeah it'll need to be

going to be able to train on many
going to be able to train on many

going to run a hyper parameter sweep
going to run a hyper parameter sweep
over it so you're going to be able to

ruce stuff like analyze hyper Fram
ruce stuff like analyze hyper Fram
sensitivity uh we do this in like some

you'll probably find a bunch of weird
you'll probably find a bunch of weird
things that are being done with rewards
things that are being done with rewards
and similar uh you're going to get the

renderer working well so you can
renderer working well so you can
actually see Behavior learning on
actually see Behavior learning on
various checkpoints right uh it's quite
various checkpoints right uh it's quite
a lot of things but generally all of
a lot of things but generally all of
these things become much easier and much
these things become much easier and much
less painful when things are
less painful when things are
fast yeah I also would like to build out
fast yeah I also would like to build out
what about for distributed multi- node
what about for distributed multi- node
multi-gpu we're not there yet RL is
multi-gpu we're not there yet RL is
still broken on one GPU in one node um
still broken on one GPU in one node um
so I mean here let me put it this way
so I mean here let me put it this way
currently in puffer lib we are training
currently in puffer lib we are training
more than a 100 times faster than most
more than a 100 times faster than most
people in RL in just like six to eight
people in RL in just like six to eight
months of development so I didn't have
months of development so I didn't have
to go build multi-gpu distributed stuff
to go build multi-gpu distributed stuff
because we're just fast now right I just
because we're just fast now right I just
made it faster
made it faster
by optimizing the single node cuz there
by optimizing the single node cuz there
was a lot of Headroom eventually we'll
was a lot of Headroom eventually we'll
get to multi- noode but before we get
get to multi- noode but before we get
there we're going to have to actually do
there we're going to have to actually do
some analysis on like how policies scale
some analysis on like how policies scale
and stuff because that's not well
and stuff because that's not well
understood in RL um so all this stuff is
understood in RL um so all this stuff is
coming you know it's all slated for this
coming you know it's all slated for this
year this is the year in which we're

going to make reinforcement learning 10
going to make reinforcement learning 10

like getting this thing to be

invoices to
send we will do that later for now we
Dev I do something stupid
Dev I do something stupid
here so there's an init function
right we're always looking for new

contributors as well if you're

interested in doing some
interested in doing some
Dev it's a good time
Dev it's a good time
got lots of people doing cool stuff in

mess look at
mess look at

nonsense here we go
I'm getting to that bet let me finish
I'm getting to that bet let me finish
this m this m is not just purely for fun
this m this m is not just purely for fun
there are also couple client things on
there are also couple client things on
this as
well not to mention we need it for
well not to mention we need it for
testing
that makes two of
us I've kind of realized that
us I've kind of realized that
um the speed at which puffer develops is
um the speed at which puffer develops is
basically going to just be a direct
basically going to just be a direct
function of the amount of hours of work
function of the amount of hours of work
that I can get out of myself and it
that I can get out of myself and it
might be super linear actually because
might be super linear actually because
the number of hours that I have uh to
the number of hours that I have uh to
actually Dev on stuff like this is equal
actually Dev on stuff like this is equal
to the total number of hours of Dev
to the total number of hours of Dev
minus the number of hours I have to
minus the number of hours I have to
spend on client stuff administrative
spend on client stuff administrative
stuff and other [ __ ] well the client
stuff and other [ __ ] well the client
stuff is good but other [ __ ] like
stuff is good but other [ __ ] like
the cluster breaking and such so um it
the cluster breaking and such so um it
can turn out that if I get a few more
can turn out that if I get a few more
hours out of myself puffer goes
hours out of myself puffer goes
dramatically
faster so the idea I have is to just
faster so the idea I have is to just
treat myself performance
treat myself performance

I'm trying with the new cluster okay
I'm trying with the new cluster okay
it's so almost all of the problems that
it's so almost all of the problems that
we've had with the cluster were not on

radiator fans have started
radiator fans have started
dying that is on main gear because they
dying that is on main gear because they
should ship higher quality fans that
should ship higher quality fans that
said we're getting the best fans in the
said we're getting the best fans in the
industry for the new machines so
not for these ones they aren't we are
not for these ones they aren't we are
getting knock for the new ones
are you getting
are you getting
industrial what do you mean
Reger and Def
Reger and Def
fans they have industrial fans let me
see is this a thing
what's the difference in the rating or
whatever well we don't need them to be
whatever well we don't need them to be
insanely fast we just need them to last
insanely fast we just need them to last
we just need them to be built to
last which to be fair I've literally
last which to be fair I've literally
never had problems with that so I assume
never had problems with that so I assume
it's just they were using super super
it's just they were using super super

whatever 20 years
what about the uh the normal like the
what about the uh the normal like the

fans can we get like at least three to
fans can we get like at least three to
five years out of
them we should be able to right not to

are good
that's
funny the warehouse space is going to be
funny the warehouse space is going to be
pretty cool
all
ah okay so I messed this function up
ah okay so I messed this function up
we'll fix this so some of this grid
we'll fix this so some of this grid

just found better ways to do stuff since

mazes here this is State star levels
here is Neptune
here is Neptune
slow no Neptune takes a couple seconds
slow no Neptune takes a couple seconds
to initialize but then it shouldn't be
to initialize but then it shouldn't be
slow
well it depends what you're looking at
well it depends what you're looking at
the dashboard shouldn't be slow yeah if
the dashboard shouldn't be slow yeah if
you go look at the charts for this
you go look at the charts for this
number of points it's going to be slow
number of points it's going to be slow
but the dashboard should be
good I don't know you want to go replace
good I don't know you want to go replace
Neptune and WBY by rewriting them in C
if you're on mine which I think is
if you're on mine which I think is
public right up
public right up
here and then you click this
tab
for e
that sounds like uh some skill
that sounds like uh some skill
issue look into that that's pretty
serious I'm messing with you UI is a
serious I'm messing with you UI is a
little silly
1K there shouldn't be 1K you got to go
1K there shouldn't be 1K you got to go
to the grouping I showed you this right
to the grouping I showed you this right
you go here you got to set tag to uh
you go here you got to set tag to uh
here I'll show
here I'll show
you so this is just all the
you so this is just all the
runs you go to
runs you go to
group tags and you get some good
group tags and you get some good
runs it's not going to render a th000
runs it's not going to render a th000
anyways it'll stop you before it does
that should only do 20
that should only do 20

wait nope still 200
okay now all we got to do is make the
maze so we just do

create maze

of two variables is all and you can see
that the curve like the top curve is the
that the curve like the top curve is the
best of each know for for every price X
best of each know for for every price X
what's the best score
what's the best score
y now it depends on which one you're
y now it depends on which one you're
looking at this one here is is not well
looking at this one here is is not well
this one has Paro on running time versus
this one has Paro on running time versus
score so the parito front is like this
score so the parito front is like this
curve right at the top right but then
curve right at the top right but then
there's more stuff right so this is not
there's more stuff right so this is not
a Paro front of any type this is just
a Paro front of any type this is just
showing you how cost changes as you
showing you how cost changes as you
continue to run the sweep right so we
continue to run the sweep right so we
have stuff like this as
well
well
yeah dashboards are good you should
yeah dashboards are good you should
probably set your own version of that
probably set your own version of that
type of stuff up it's good we like a

the puffer blog but then there's some

off topic things but also some like
off topic things but also some like
random things that are kind of funny

like a bunch of random stuff on
here there's the 50k article which is
fun oh yeah you got got to uh it takes a

the blue check um it uh it just boosts

algorithm as well that's part of it they
just straight up sell you um reach boost
so if you're actually trying to promote
so if you're actually trying to promote
stuff it's just stupid not to
have I don't think the org one boosts
have I don't think the org one boosts
you even more otherwise I would actually
you even more otherwise I would actually
look at
it the org one is very expensive though
yeah do they still tell you that they do
this oh
this oh
wait yeah they actually do have it
wait yeah they actually do have it
they don't tell you how
much that's the thing they don't tell

it yeah so this is 116 a month for basic
or 580 something for premium
only for another two

we'll deal with this later
don't know why I'm getting so much

I wouldn't worry too

I don't know I wouldn't be
surprised larger models aren't always

better in RL
huh
yeah you're just kind of fiddling with
yeah you're just kind of fiddling with
stuff at this point and like these
