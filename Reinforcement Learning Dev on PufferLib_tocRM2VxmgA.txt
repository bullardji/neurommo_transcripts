look, it actually solves this.
That's the type of thing you'd want for
That's the type of thing you'd want for

in a corner somewhere.
Like this in particular, like this

You should have gotten the puffer
You should have gotten the puffer
baseline working
properly. Puffer is just going to
win. Buffer is just going to win.
There's so many implementation
There's so many implementation
details. What do you mean porting it for

a you don't have to you don't have to
a you don't have to you don't have to
port any of it. You just need the you
port any of it. You just need the you
just need the environment and the
just need the environment and the
policy and then just run our defaults

and it'll do better.
Like that's the idea. The goal is not
Like that's the idea. The goal is not
that we do exactly what whatever whoever
that we do exactly what whatever whoever
else does. The goal is that you just you
else does. The goal is that you just you
take your thing, you run it on puffer,
take your thing, you run it on puffer,
maybe you do a sweep, and we just
maybe you do a sweep, and we just
win like across the board. And it's
win like across the board. And it's
pretty well there. Like we're solving a
pretty well there. Like we're solving a
ton of different problems at this point.
How do I not make this multinnomial
explode? If you give this thing ins, it
explode? If you give this thing ins, it
explodes, right?
I don't think it'll work without their
I don't think it'll work without their
net hack specific
hacks. I

mean, we do have a dramatically better

trainer and algorithm and tooling. Like,

we've got some pretty darn good stuff at

easier to use.
easier to use.
and to like hack on new stuff
with. You just need to have the N run
with. You just need to have the N run
nice and fast for me. If you get the M

to run nice and fast, we can probably
to run nice and fast, we can probably
just We're not going to just full solve
just We're not going to just full solve
net hack, right? That's AI complete. But
net hack, right? That's AI complete. But
I think we'll do pretty damn well.
Do I just mask out imps
here? I think I just mask out
imps. We just do this.
Well, but like you can use that version
Well, but like you can use that version
of the codebase with puffer, right? We
of the codebase with puffer, right? We
just have like a gymlike interface or a
just have like a gymlike interface or a
gym ve like interface. Your
choice. So the other thing is um
Do they have Okay, I'm thinking the one
Do they have Okay, I'm thinking the one
thing with Sample Factory that might
thing with Sample Factory that might
still be better, I think you would want
still be better, I think you would want
to have
to have

a C or C++ multi-threading based uh
vecend back end

ideally. So, if you had one of those,
ideally. So, if you had one of those,
you could just plug it into Puffer like
you could just plug it into Puffer like
because you could just match the VEC
because you could just match the VEC
interface to it. Um, and then you could
interface to it. Um, and then you could
still use our trainer and our sweeps and
still use our trainer and our sweeps and
stuff and our algorithm and we you'd
stuff and our algorithm and we you'd
still
win. Oh, wait. Is it
win. Oh, wait. Is it
not I forget if it's not process safe or
not I forget if it's not process safe or
not thread safe? Net hack. You'd have to
not thread safe? Net hack. You'd have to
check on
that. I actually I can't think of
that. I actually I can't think of
why because of the
why because of the
globals. Maybe it isn't thread safe. I
globals. Maybe it isn't thread safe. I
don't know.
don't know.
I will spend at least three days
I will spend at least three days
seriously trying to make a a net hack
seriously trying to make a a net hack
based on work and puffer. I just think
based on work and puffer. I just think
it'll be hard. Okay, I'm very happy with
it'll be hard. Okay, I'm very happy with
that and I will very well help you when
that and I will very well help you when
you want uh when you want to see that
happen. Net hack isn't thread safe and
happen. Net hack isn't thread safe and
but NLE
is
is
interesting. I mean, you can always just
interesting. I mean, you can always just
run like the 16 processes or whatever uh
run like the 16 processes or whatever uh
with Puffer, but you're just you're
with Puffer, but you're just you're
limited to batch size 16, which
sucks. They make a copy of DL for each
sucks. They make a copy of DL for each
instance,
huh? Interesting.
huh? Interesting.
I mean, so
like does that mean that you can run
like does that mean that you can run
them on the same process or
them on the same process or
No, can you like load that multiple
No, can you like load that multiple
times and run them on the same process
times and run them on the same process
or is that still messed up? I actually
or is that still messed up? I actually
don't know how that
works. Look, if you have unique state
works. Look, if you have unique state
and you can load me a thousand copies of
and you can load me a thousand copies of
Net Hack, I think we insta win.
Net Hack, I think we insta win.
If you can do like a thousand copies of
If you can do like a thousand copies of
Net Hack or like let's say 1024 and we
Net Hack or like let's say 1024 and we
split them on 16 workers, right? And we
split them on 16 workers, right? And we
just alternate back and forth batches of
just alternate back and forth batches of

that. We'll even have DDP working with
that. We'll even have DDP working with

that. So we can even run distributed.
Let's say we did like single node. Well,
Let's say we did like single node. Well,
single node distributed doesn't really
single node distributed doesn't really
help you because you're going to be uh
help you because you're going to be uh
you're going to be CPU bound. Um, but
you're going to be CPU bound. Um, but
like even if we just ran on like one
like even if we just ran on like one
good box, let's say we got like a one or
good box, let's say we got like a one or
two GPU box with a Thread Ripper on it,
two GPU box with a Thread Ripper on it,
like a 64 uh CPU Thread Ripper, like we
like a 64 uh CPU Thread Ripper, like we
should probably just
win. They can run hundreds on 10 CPUs.
win. They can run hundreds on 10 CPUs.
Yeah, but if they're opening just a
Yeah, but if they're opening just a
separate process per M is lame, right?
separate process per M is lame, right?
And also Puffer Libs Vec doesn't like it
And also Puffer Libs Vec doesn't like it
when you do
when you do
that. Like I could make a hacked version
that. Like I could make a hacked version
of it that wouldn't be as bad for that,
of it that wouldn't be as bad for that,
but it's just way better if you cannot
but it's just way better if you cannot
have them be single like for process.
I will actually help you with that
I will actually help you with that
though if you if you seriously want to
though if you if you seriously want to
do net hack stuff and like we'll put in
do net hack stuff and like we'll put in
time then I will also put in some time
time then I will also put in some time
to like make that work
well and like in your assessment like
well and like in your assessment like
was the rapper done competently?
Let's see if this fixes it.
We'll see if this still crashes.
They should be torturous,
man. Yeah. So, I think that that would

be usually just assuming that out that
be usually just assuming that out that
researchers did any low-level thing that
researchers did any low-level thing that
they touched wrong is a good
assumption. I can look at it with

I'm surprised you haven't jumped onto

suck. That seems like it would be right
suck. That seems like it would be right
up your
up your

to graduate excuse either.
Ah, that's a lame excuse
though. That's not a real excuse.
Like heck, if you want uh if you want to
Like heck, if you want uh if you want to
just jam some RL for a bit and you just
just jam some RL for a bit and you just
want like a stipen to do whatever until

I mean, at this point, like, nothing

kind of weird to like do it on something

well. So that's kind of how it works
around here.
We're just going to do this for now.
not import exceptions. Yeah, we have to
not import exceptions. Yeah, we have to
refactor a whole bunch of stuff Now,
I don't know why I made all these little

Frankly, this is just going to be so

like this guy. Of course, as soon as I
like this guy. Of course, as soon as I
start looking at your thing, I'm sure
start looking at your thing, I'm sure
he's going to message me. But for all I
he's going to message me. But for all I
know, he might not show up. He might do

his previous meeting, but that was
his previous meeting, but that was
supposed to be 7 minutes
ago. I don't have a clean commit state
ago. I don't have a clean commit state
though at the moment. So maybe let me
though at the moment. So maybe let me
finish this refactor and if he hasn't
finish this refactor and if he hasn't
pinged me by then then I'll do
it. What's going on? This is
it. What's going on? This is

making RL work on it. And with Puffer
Lib you can make that process very very

the project and all the new Ms that
people build in the process of this
people build in the process of this
become essentially tests for all the
become essentially tests for all the
algorithms that we build. Uh so it also
algorithms that we build. Uh so it also
helps advance the research as well.
I'm just nobody. You got fire.
What? I don't know what you're referring
What? I don't know what you're referring
to

That's a fun overview. It's mostly still

all relevant as well.
all relevant as well.
I hope people watch that thing. I put a
I hope people watch that thing. I put a
lot of work into that. That was how I
lot of work into that. That was how I
decided, okay, I'm not going to be
decided, okay, I'm not going to be
making YouTube videos. Um, it's just not
making YouTube videos. Um, it's just not
worth it. I I should be spending my time
worth it. I I should be spending my time
actually doing research and just do all
actually doing research and just do all
this stuff live.
no attribute puffer. It should
right you have a channel on YouTube.
right you have a channel on YouTube.
Yep. Um, I I'm here YouTube, which it
Yep. Um, I I'm here YouTube, which it
just streams to all the platforms and
just streams to all the platforms and
then all the VODs just go to
YouTube. They're not edited or anything
YouTube. They're not edited or anything
and they get cut up every time, you
and they get cut up every time, you
know, there's an internet outage or I
know, there's an internet outage or I
have to like go do a thing or whatever,
have to like go do a thing or whatever,
but you can technically you have all the
but you can technically you have all the
the logs up there.
This has got to be like some weird
This has got to be like some weird
import order thing,
right? Import puffer
lib. It's probably like imports too much
lib. It's probably like imports too much
stuff or something.
Oh, I wonder if this
is It's probably from
is It's probably from
pufferlib.pufferlib import star,
right? Yeah, that's
it. Yeah, that's why I messed up.
Yeah, maybe we will just leave it
Yeah, maybe we will just leave it
like like this.
3:15 Easter. Yeah, I don't know.
3:15 Easter. Yeah, I don't know.
I was supposed to have a meeting uh 15
I was supposed to have a meeting uh 15
minutes ago, but
iceberg vid is like a good
iceberg vid is like a good
overview the post on that I like I

should brought up on puffer.ai as well
should brought up on puffer.ai as well

looking to get into this

Um, like most of those are from
Um, like most of those are from
contributors.
What happened here?
Oh,
Nice.
Yes. Okay, that's
Yes. Okay, that's
clean. Now, you can argue whether I'm
clean. Now, you can argue whether I'm
making it actually better or not doing
making it actually better or not doing
this
stuff, but I don't know. I I like it
stuff, but I don't know. I I like it
more this
more this
way. And it makes it way
way. And it makes it way
[Music]
[Music]
easier. It cleans up the name
easier. It cleans up the name
spaces. I should have done this a long
spaces. I should have done this a long
time ago.
Whether that's stable or not, who knows?
Whether that's stable or not, who knows?
But this is a dev branch, so who
cares? So now we have a whole bunch of
cares? So now we have a whole bunch of
stuff in this 450 line file instead of
stuff in this 450 line file instead of
having like five separate fiddly little
having like five separate fiddly little
files.
And if we look at what's in
uh in Pupper now, we've got
uh in Pupper now, we've got
emulation.py, we've got a little Sython
emulation.py, we've got a little Sython
code extensions, we've got
code extensions, we've got
models, got
pufferlib.py, got a CUDA kernel, we've
pufferlib.py, got a CUDA kernel, we've
got some C stuff in here. We have our
got some C stuff in here. We have our
pietorch
pietorch
stuff. We've got spaces. Got
stuff. We've got spaces. Got
sweeps. The only thing that I don't know
sweeps. The only thing that I don't know
about is
utils.
Hello.
Um, right. So, the thing I was doing
Um, right. So, the thing I was doing
before was I was just looking for dead
before was I was just looking for dead
code in here.
Yeah. So, this validate args, we get rid
Yeah. So, this validate args, we get rid
of
this. Do we still use get init
args? Okay, that's actually a little
args? Okay, that's actually a little
suspicious. Oh, you know what we did? We
suspicious. Oh, you know what we did? We
changed it to anything in the config
changed it to anything in the config
instead of anything in this init. So we
instead of anything in this init. So we
simplified a little
bit. I know we use unroll nested dict a
bit. I know we use unroll nested dict a
bunch.
We use this a
bunch. We still have this
install. No, we do not have
uh but we might have install and
uh but we might have install and
import. No, we don't use this
either for this.
Okay, we still use
this check.
En this gets used in
utils and in vector but I think vector
utils and in vector but I think vector
has its own checks.
Okay. So, this we don't use this
anymore. Why are you ignoring? Cuz
anymore. Why are you ignoring? Cuz
you're just saying random stuff in my
chat.
chat.
Uh, make zeros.
Okay. So this is I think we do use this
Okay. So this is I think we do use this
for tests,
right? So it would be compare space
right? So it would be compare space
samples I
guess. Yeah. So this is only used in
guess. Yeah. So this is only used in
tests it looks like.
So, we should move all of this stuff
into. We should move like this
into. We should move like this
stuff. How about compare arrays? Hang
on. So, all of this stuff needs to get
on. So, all of this stuff needs to get
moved here.
Get DT type
bounce. Okay, so this actually does get
bounce. Okay, so this actually does get
used.
So, I think we just take this stuff
So, I think we just take this stuff
here and we put this into like
here and we put this into like
a
temporary. We use this in two different
temporary. We use this in two different
places. I'll put this in test I for
places. I'll put this in test I for
now. Maybe
And I'll add a todo fix
And I'll add a todo fix
this was in
this was in
utils
only. Okay. So then there's get dtype
only. Okay. So then there's get dtype
bounce.
bounce.
This is only used in
emulation.py. Emulate native eyes.
is dict space. We use this type of
stuff. Nope.
There's no way this is
used. Yeah, I just like left a bunch of
used. Yeah, I just like left a bunch of
garbage in here.
Okay, so this actually does get
used only in tests.
This is in
um we have that in in clean puffer. We
um we have that in in clean puffer. We
do not use this
profiler or this or this. We replace all
profiler or this or this. We replace all
of this actually.
of this actually.
And then I believe we do use
suppress. We do use
suppress. We do use
suppress in several M's that are
suppress in several M's that are
annoying. Okay. Order dict doesn't get
annoying. Okay. Order dict doesn't get
used.
used.
Null context doesn't get used. Time
Null context doesn't get used. Time
doesn't get used.
doesn't get used.
OS OS gets used.
OS OS gets used.
Pickle subprocess
direct. Yeah, we use these redirects
direct. Yeah, we use these redirects
still ring io. We use
still ring io. We use
this
still wrap.
Now what we do is we take all
this and we move it to Here.
That's nicely
organized. 510
organized. 510
lines. Not bad.
I'm surprised you're using grap instead
I'm surprised you're using grap instead
of something like
of something like
telescope. I just don't use that many
telescope. I just don't use that many
tools.
Like I've like never really bothered to
Like I've like never really bothered to
get into using
get into using
very many tools like at
very many tools like at
all. I don't know. I use a pretty small
all. I don't know. I use a pretty small
set of pretty simple things.
Cool. That now that now works. That
Cool. That now that now works. That
should be a big uh commit diff.
Yeah. Minus 300.
code size getting smaller is
code size getting smaller is
good. So, aside from this, I think we
good. So, aside from this, I think we
only
only
have we only have uh clean puffl, right?
which is only like another
which is only like another
thousand. Oh, and this is also not the
thousand. Oh, and this is also not the
um the full line count, right? This
um the full line count, right? This
includes like whites space.
So once that gets moved
So once that gets moved
in, I mean 4,000 linesish for all the
in, I mean 4,000 linesish for all the
puffer pythons pretty
puffer pythons pretty
solid. I think it can even get smaller
solid. I think it can even get smaller
than this if we like work on some
things. And then obviously the uh most
things. And then obviously the uh most
of the expansion is in C.
of the expansion is in C.
And really if you think about it
And really if you think about it
like the actual stack that we use is
like the actual stack that we use is
probably half of this and the rest is
probably half of this and the rest is
like for emulation for stuff like
like for emulation for stuff like
Atari. There's probably stuff in PyTorch
Atari. There's probably stuff in PyTorch
we can delete as well. But this is I
we can delete as well. But this is I
mean this is like a pretty darn
good pretty darn good setup.
Let's um let's start taking a look at
Let's um let's start taking a look at
your
your

at your uh your code here cuz I don't
at your uh your code here cuz I don't
know where these guys
are. I don't know. This is like the
are. I don't know. This is like the
second or third time they've done this.
second or third time they've done this.
Well,
Please direct me as to where I should
look.
Perfect. I've been waiting for this one
Perfect. I've been waiting for this one
for a
for a
while. I've actually I really wanted
while. I've actually I really wanted
this amp to play around
with. Buffers, of course. Bonus points.
Is this um PR review or is there are
Is this um PR review or is there are
there issues that need to be
fixed? Okay, so this is the second time
fixed? Okay, so this is the second time
now I've seen this. Why Why does
now I've seen this. Why Why does
everybody have
everybody have
these? Like did you get these from
these? Like did you get these from
captain or from
uh these came from somewhere, right? Oh,
uh these came from somewhere, right? Oh,
from Bet. Yeah, this is from Damn it.
from Bet. Yeah, this is from Damn it.
Yeah, Bet didn't It's a lot easier than
Yeah, Bet didn't It's a lot easier than
this. Um yeah, Bet didn't understand the
this. Um yeah, Bet didn't understand the
way that we were doing stuff with our
way that we were doing stuff with our
VEC API when he did this. I can show you
VEC API when he did this. I can show you
how that works.
Yeah, this is about what it should look
Yeah, this is about what it should look
like. Something like this. I would
like. Something like this. I would
expect to see like a numbum agents param
expect to see like a numbum agents param
in here or something if it's not just
in here or something if it's not just
hardcoded. Oh, it's hardcoded. Okay.
hardcoded. Oh, it's hardcoded. Okay.
Well, it's hardcoded
Well, it's hardcoded
here. Huh.
here. Huh.
There probably should be a agents
here, but you want me to do uh leave
here, but you want me to do uh leave
comments on this so it's easier for you
comments on this so it's easier for you
to track
stuff. Just trying to get everything
stuff. Just trying to get everything
working. Okay, then let's let's actually
working. Okay, then let's let's actually
we we can do even uh I'm not looking for
we we can do even uh I'm not looking for
a review as of yet. Okay. So, what what
a review as of yet. Okay. So, what what
is it that you'd like me to look at
is it that you'd like me to look at
then? Like what is the thing that
then? Like what is the thing that
doesn't
work? Action shape bug. Gotcha. Gotcha.

Okay. I have multiple contributors and I
Okay. I have multiple contributors and I
I didn't remember whether it was you who
I didn't remember whether it was you who
had the action bug. Okay, cool.
weird. All right, but this is
weird. All right, but this is
built. Um, what was it?
Dash
local is in a
branch. Probably in a branch,
branch. Probably in a branch,
right? Create voids.
Okay, we should have
voids. Uh, is this thing supposed to
build? You wanna just push to your Yeah,

just push to your thing and I'll pull
just push to your thing and I'll pull
Just push to that branch and I'll pull

It's like random stuff and then people

Oh yeah, in the meantime we can check.
Oh yeah, in the meantime we can check.
Um Oh, this is still crashing,
Um Oh, this is still crashing,
right? Wait, hang
right? Wait, hang
on. Didn't we start another sweep? What
on. Didn't we start another sweep? What
happened?
Oh, wait. The This is Pong. Yeah, we
Oh, wait. The This is Pong. Yeah, we
started a Pong sweep. That must have
crashed. That's

annoying. I thought that that would have
annoying. I thought that that would have
fixed
it. Yeah, this is or breakout sweep.
Yeah, policy gradient
loss binary. Search

multinnomial. So it is screwing up in
multinnomial. So it is screwing up in
the multinnomial kernel.
Still kind of weird.
up a multinnomial kernel is
weird.
weird.
Enduro, you mean voids, right?
Dude, I love
Dude, I love

this. This is so
good. Oh man, I wanted one of these for
good. Oh man, I wanted one of these for
so long.
so long.
And it's funny because like I

technically built something that you

not import binding. So I I have to
not import binding. So I I have to
compile this, right?
Uh, you did not add a binding here
Uh, you did not add a binding here
yet. Oh, how is this supposed to train
yet. Oh, how is this supposed to train
if there's no

Did you commit
it? You should do that.

virtual. Well, I'm I should get UV
because it's fast. We don't have virtual

M's. You see, like we're in containers.
So, like if you're stacking virtual M's
So, like if you're stacking virtual M's
inside of containers, it's like you've
inside of containers, it's like you've
put an MV in like I don't know. That's
put an MV in like I don't know. That's
that's got to be illegal or something,
right? Like putting a bag of holding in
right? Like putting a bag of holding in
a portable hole.
Yeah, it's helpful if you're not in a
Yeah, it's helpful if you're not in a
container, but we like our
container, but we like our
containers. Even for local dev, I have
containers. Even for local dev, I have
container like because I have an
container like because I have an
identical setup then right here and on
identical setup then right here and on
the
the
cluster. It's like it's just it helps so
cluster. It's like it's just it helps so
much to just have the full

container. That is something I am
working on
working on
Jason. I am working on that. But that's
Jason. I am working on that. But that's
only in
only in
dev. That is only in the dev branch.
Uh there is technically you do kind of
Uh there is technically you do kind of
need CUDA with the new stuff plasma.
need CUDA with the new stuff plasma.
There's um because we ship CUDA kernels
There's um because we ship CUDA kernels
and uh you need like a graceful CPU
and uh you need like a graceful CPU
fallback. So that is something that I am
fallback. So that is something that I am
working on. There will be a graceful
working on. There will be a graceful
fallback. I already figured out how to
fallback. I already figured out how to
do it. I just have to adjust some stuff
do it. I just have to adjust some stuff
in the setup.py
still. It took like four hours. It was
still. It took like four hours. It was
not fun.
Who agents?
There's one
There's one
M. No, hold on. Let me see what you did.
M some
M some
voids. So, this supposed to be one M and
voids. So, this supposed to be one M and
one void, except that the defaults will
one void, except that the defaults will
spawn two M's. So, it is two M's with
spawn two M's. So, it is two M's with
one void each, I
guess. Well, this is wrong.
The single the single space is for a
The single the single space is for a
single
single
agent. Each board is an agent.
Now, this is going to take absolutely
Now, this is going to take absolutely
forever because
forever because
um well, you have
um well, you have
one environment being passed.
Ah, now we get the error
again. All right.
3 to
three. Yeah. So, you set this to -3 to 3
three. Yeah. So, you set this to -3 to 3
and the policy is not doing anything to
and the policy is not doing anything to
clip this. So, you didn't even get to
clip this. So, you didn't even get to
this error, I assume, here. Um, but this
this error, I assume, here. Um, but this
would be you set it to like negative in
would be you set it to like negative in
inf or your policy has to clip it
inf or your policy has to clip it
somehow. So, we're going to set
Oops. Okay. So, you clip it, but you
Oops. Okay. So, you clip it, but you
clip it to the action space. So, this is
clip it to the action space. So, this is
too late cuz the check has already
occurred. You'd want to do something
occurred. You'd want to do something
like this.
I mean to be fair this is something that
I mean to be fair this is something that
I could improve on in the continuous
I could improve on in the continuous
API. Let me let me see about
that. Does this return any logs?
Yeah. One sec.
could be all right.
Well, this will run,
right? Those are just array lib leaks.
right? Those are just array lib leaks.
Yeah. Fine. Uh, float
episode. Let's see how you're doing your
logging. Is this Syon or is this um
logging. Is this Syon or is this um
bindings?
New C bindings.
Cool. So when does this termination get
Cool. So when does this termination get
called? Current void reward less
called? Current void reward less
than.99F.
So this is if they get to the edge of
So this is if they get to the edge of
the
the
screen. Is it possible for them to get
screen. Is it possible for them to get
this far? Cuz like don't they get cut
this far? Cuz like don't they get cut
off? Cuz like the puffer has some width
off? Cuz like the puffer has some width
to
it. Yeah. So the puffer is like isn't it
it. Yeah. So the puffer is like isn't it
going to get cut off way before.99?
Rewards are cumulative.
Rewards are cumulative.
That's
sure current. This is current void
sure current. This is current void

equal. Hey bro, what are you doing? I'm
equal. Hey bro, what are you doing? I'm
currently helping Plasma here debug this
currently helping Plasma here debug this
awesome new
environment in which there are lots of
environment in which there are lots of
puffer fish swimming around.
We're going to get reinforcement
We're going to get reinforcement
learning working on
learning working on
this. We're going to get this thing
debugged. Can we move and just try
debugged. Can we move and just try
something real
quick? Make sure it's not a thing that I
quick? Make sure it's not a thing that I
could like easily guess. Oh, also you
could like easily guess. Oh, also you
have to uh manually for now purge old
have to uh manually for now purge old
builds until I figure out a way to clean
builds until I figure out a way to clean
this
out. And now it's done
this. That is a new annoying quirk. I
this. That is a new annoying quirk. I
will figure out how to fix that.
will figure out how to fix that.
Okay. So, the thing I suggested was
Okay. So, the thing I suggested was
completely
wrong. A video for
wrong. A video for
you and make videos teaching people
you and make videos teaching people
RL. Well, I made a couple of them. The
RL. Well, I made a couple of them. The
thesis defense did really well. The one
thesis defense did really well. The one
after didn't. So, I just figured um
after didn't. So, I just figured um
mostly I just stream all the dev live
mostly I just stream all the dev live
now and I answer stuff while I'm working
now and I answer stuff while I'm working
on things. It takes a long time to make
on things. It takes a long time to make
videos and really the main objective
videos and really the main objective
here is to push RL forward. I can't be
here is to push RL forward. I can't be
doing research if I'm making videos all
doing research if I'm making videos all
day.
Okay, this is never getting called.
Current void reward
Current void reward
is reward
is reward
minus. This is a normalized thing.
All right. These rewards seem completely
All right. These rewards seem completely
wrong to me,
wrong to me,
right? Like it's mostly getting a ton of

Uh well it depends how much you go into
Uh well it depends how much you go into
it right like uh CS231N is a course I
it right like uh CS231N is a course I
recommend everyone they have you do
recommend everyone they have you do
something similar we have um a
something similar we have um a
inferenceon one in pure C and puffer
inferenceon one in pure C and puffer
liib as
liib as
well I don't know if the right thing to
well I don't know if the right thing to
do is you get an intern as a research
student typically you just have to like
student typically you just have to like
meet and talk with professors for the
meet and talk with professors for the
most part
most part
Um it's very difficult to get a research
Um it's very difficult to get a research
internship uh as an undergraduate at
internship uh as an undergraduate at
like a a big lab or somewhere. You can
like a a big lab or somewhere. You can
get applied stuff, not really research
get applied stuff, not really research
stuff unless you're like you have uh
stuff unless you're like you have uh
some solid publication history and then
some solid publication history and then
yes, you can potentially do
yes, you can potentially do
that. But best bet is to do like uh
that. But best bet is to do like uh
stuff in academic labs.
So, I don't know what this reward
So, I don't know what this reward
function is supposed to be,
function is supposed to be,
man. But, um, whatever it is currently,
man. But, um, whatever it is currently,
maybe I can figure it
out. Let's see. So, reward is zero.
It also you don't have to make them
It also you don't have to make them
respawn ever, right? The the actual ones
respawn ever, right? The the actual ones
in voids don't ever respawn. I think you
in voids don't ever respawn. I think you
were just looking for a way to get logs
were just looking for a way to get logs
in, weren't you?
You can get actions into it with eval no
You can get actions into it with eval no
problem either
way. Heck, this thing still isn't
Well, that's
weird with diff optimization algorithms.
Um, I mean, yeah, like depending on the
Um, I mean, yeah, like depending on the
type of thing, it can either
be it's like anything from a basic
be it's like anything from a basic
exercise up to you built PyTorch,
right? Resnet and VGG from pre-trained
weights. That seems more substantial.
I mean, what what is your goal though in
I mean, what what is your goal though in
um like what's your goal in showing me
this? Like I can technically review
this? Like I can technically review
whatever ML stuff. Yeah. But we mainly
whatever ML stuff. Yeah. But we mainly
do uh reinforcement learning and
do uh reinforcement learning and
reinforcement learning adjacent things
reinforcement learning adjacent things
here.
I would just delete this.
just make
just make

Yeah, I highly recommend those. Yeah,
Yeah, I highly recommend those. Yeah,
for sure. If you don't want to die
for sure. If you don't want to die
squatting.
squatting.
Yeah, generally preferable to not.
And I like I like training to failure
And I like I like training to failure
sometimes as well. So, like it's better.
sometimes as well. So, like it's better.
What was the problem? I want I want to
What was the problem? I want I want to
know what was wrong with it. Oh, thanks.
know what was wrong with it. Oh, thanks.
Uh, I need to write myself a note to fix
Uh, I need to write myself a note to fix
that as
well. Uh, you pushed right. I I
well. Uh, you pushed right. I I
pulled. See?
So, uh, there were several issues. One
So, uh, there were several issues. One
was also like,
was also like,
uh, you didn't push yet.
So, the two main ones that were that he
So, the two main ones that were that he
didn't he did not initialize
didn't he did not initialize
um the number of agents in uh in the
um the number of agents in uh in the
environment itself. Actually, there were
environment itself. Actually, there were
three main ones. one had the single
three main ones. one had the single
observation space he was defining for
observation space he was defining for
all agents. It was the wrong shape. And
all agents. It was the wrong shape. And
then the uh environment was
then the uh environment was
exporting or the environment wasn't
exporting or the environment wasn't
exporting logs because it had it never
exporting logs because it had it never
got numbum agents in the initialization.
got numbum agents in the initialization.
So that needed to be fixed. And then uh
So that needed to be fixed. And then uh
additionally the log was an int. Like
additionally the log was an int. Like
the logs are intended to be all floats
the logs are intended to be all floats
right now. And we literally check
right now. And we literally check
numittes. How do we become an int? like
numittes. How do we become an int? like
I like how is it becoming an int because
I like how is it becoming an int because
I obviously put them all to floats when
I obviously put them all to floats when
I was when I was trying to make it work.
I was when I was trying to make it work.
Uh but that didn't make it work
Uh but that didn't make it work
because they have three different bugs.
because they have three different bugs.
Yeah, that's probably why. Uh okay. So
Yeah, that's probably why. Uh okay. So
observation shape was wrong. So So
observation shape was wrong. So So
plasma that that was that was one of one
plasma that that was that was one of one
of one of the I told you there's there
of one of the I told you there's there
are many like oneline gotchas. That was
are many like oneline gotchas. That was
one of them I think. So yeah. Cool. I'm
one of them I think. So yeah. Cool. I'm
I'm what I really just hope is that I
I'm what I really just hope is that I
can see the actions and the observations
can see the actions and the observations
and like I can actually see them being
and like I can actually see them being
passed down to see cuz with the Syon
passed down to see cuz with the Syon
they weren't. Yeah. Well, you can debug
they weren't. Yeah. Well, you can debug
now is the nice thing. So at least like
now is the nice thing. So at least like
you have break points. Exactly. Exactly.
you have break points. Exactly. Exactly.
And I saw you using GDB instead of uh
And I saw you using GDB instead of uh
PDB as well which is I did not know GDB
PDB as well which is I did not know GDB
can debug Python.
usually. Well, it'll it'll drop you into
usually. Well, it'll it'll drop you into
the C, which is nice, right? That's uh
generally just use PTB if it's if it's
generally just use PTB if it's if it's
in the Python
files. Yeah.
Um it's very nice. I
Um it's very nice. I
know. Yeah.
know. Yeah.
Have you pushed uh those changes? Yeah,
Have you pushed uh those changes? Yeah,
I pushed it. Okay. This is going to be a
I pushed it. Okay. This is going to be a
fun end once we have it like doing stuff
fun end once we have it like doing stuff
as well. Oh yeah, it's going to be a

super fun. I think for you suggestions,
super fun. I think for you suggestions,
don't try to make it delete agents. You
don't try to make it delete agents. You
don't need to do that. You don't need to
don't need to do that. You don't need to
reset the end after like end steps or
reset the end after like end steps or
anything. Um yeah, don't delete agents.
anything. Um yeah, don't delete agents.
Don't I guess I mean Yeah.
So the ends. So like when you were
So the ends. So like when you were
saying like don't delete them, are you
saying like don't delete them, are you
just saying like don't terminate them?
just saying like don't terminate them?
Yeah, you don't need to terminate them
Yeah, you don't need to terminate them
at all. Yeah. So just to make Yeah, just
at all. Yeah. So just to make Yeah, just
make them like just get bad get like get
make them like just get bad get like get
very bad reward and it's just going to
very bad reward and it's just going to
be you know Yeah. And you can just log
be you know Yeah. And you can just log
at fixed intervals is fine.
This maze solver really good.

did uh what I do like three sets of push
did uh what I do like three sets of push
presses today and then I've just been
presses today and then I've just been
doing light like light bench sets of 15
doing light like light bench sets of 15
to 20 just every time I get up. Aside
to 20 just every time I get up. Aside
from that.
Yeah. Um, do you do any like calisthenic
Yeah. Um, do you do any like calisthenic
stuffs or like pull-ups? Uh, I do some

pull-ups. That's about it. Mhm. Have you
pull-ups. That's about it. Mhm. Have you
tried weighted pull-ups? Uh, when I did
tried weighted pull-ups? Uh, when I did
weighted pull-ups, my best was a two
weighted pull-ups, my best was a two
plate weighted for one. So, 245s. Yeah.
plate weighted for one. So, 245s. Yeah.
That's That's insane. Yeah. But now, you
That's That's insane. Yeah. But now, you
know, I really like this thing. I don't
know, I really like this thing. I don't
know if I'll be able to hit it having

Yeah. Damn. Oh, is he going all the way
up? Uh, no, he
did. Yeah. Damn. Yeah, that's good.
Well, that thing's a lot of fun. Yeah. I
Well, that thing's a lot of fun. Yeah. I
mean, that that's good if you have the

budget for it. I'm running on budget.
budget for it. I'm running on budget.
So, what I do is I do like uh Do you
So, what I do is I do like uh Do you
know what front levers are? Yeah. I
know what front levers are? Yeah. I
don't do that type of calisthenics
don't do that type of calisthenics
stuff, but I know those. Yeah, I do that
stuff, but I know those. Yeah, I do that
and then I basically have all I need for
and then I basically have all I need for
calisthenics is a dip bars, a uh like a
calisthenics is a dip bars, a uh like a
chair and um like a pull-up bar with a
chair and um like a pull-up bar with a
weighted vest and that's all I need cuz
weighted vest and that's all I need cuz
then again I can just progressively
then again I can just progressively
overload. I mean technically all I need
overload. I mean technically all I need
is like just a base rack and a bench
is like just a base rack and a bench
with a bar but uh you know it's more fun
with a bar but uh you know it's more fun
to have it's more fun when you have a
to have it's more fun when you have a
bunch of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. You you have
bunch of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. You you have
your training you have your literally
your training you have your literally
your uh train environment training
your uh train environment training
facility not written in C though not
facility not written in C though not
written in C maybe I am though I don't
written in C maybe I am though I don't
know
know
yeah maybe
so uh we got your set oh
so uh we got your set oh
I just did so bet this is the
I just did so bet this is the
new this you'll find this interesting
new this you'll find this interesting
for
So this is what it currently looks like.
So this is what it currently looks like.
The puffer lib folder, the pi files in
The puffer lib folder, the pi files in
it. Interesting.
it. Interesting.
Very interesting. So
Very interesting. So
it's 3.3k total. Way fewer files. A lot
it's 3.3k total. Way fewer files. A lot
of stuff I moved all the little shitty
of stuff I moved all the little shitty
files I moved into just pufferlib.py.
files I moved into just pufferlib.py.
Okay. Oh, yeah. That's a new one. Yeah.
Okay. Oh, yeah. That's a new one. Yeah.
And then clean pufferell is going to go
And then clean pufferell is going to go
in here now. So then that'll bring us to
in here now. So then that'll bring us to
under 5k for the entire puffer python.
under 5k for the entire puffer python.
Like all the puffer python. So it's all
Like all the puffer python. So it's all
it's all going to be in the puffer lib
it's all going to be in the puffer lib
folder. Puffer lib. Puffer lib. Oh, I I
folder. Puffer lib. Puffer lib. Oh, I I
think I already showed you that I merged
think I already showed you that I merged
the demo file with clean puffl.
the demo file with clean puffl.
Uh no. Oh, so this is this is less than
Uh no. Oh, so this is this is less than
a thousand lines of actual code now. And
a thousand lines of actual code now. And
it has both. That's wild. You were you
it has both. That's wild. You were you
were Oh, you know what? No, I watched
were Oh, you know what? No, I watched
you editing it. I didn't I didn't look
you editing it. I didn't I didn't look
on the bottom to see what file you were
on the bottom to see what file you were
in, though. I just assumed you were in
in, though. I just assumed you were in
demo. Yeah. No, this is everything now.
demo. Yeah. No, this is everything now.
So, this is like there a couple bugs,
So, this is like there a couple bugs,
but it's like it's super condensed. And
but it's like it's super condensed. And
uh I mean, it's literally we're getting
uh I mean, it's literally we're getting
Well, except it's not
Well, except it's not
golfed. It's not golfed at all. That's
uh extreme extreme intensity because
uh extreme extreme intensity because
both of those files were kind of
both of those files were kind of
daunting. Yeah.
daunting. Yeah.
So the hope is this should just make it
So the hope is this should just make it
way easier now for people and like it's
way easier now for people and like it's
just a much thinner stack as well.
just a much thinner stack as well.
Um I think that honestly if I tried
Um I think that honestly if I tried
really hard I could probably cut another
really hard I could probably cut another
like 700 lines out of this thing but it
like 700 lines out of this thing but it
would take so much time. I'm gonna
would take so much time. I'm gonna
settle for cutting, you know, another
settle for cutting, you know, another
couple hundred out and we'll call it
couple hundred out and we'll call it
there.
So, I mean, I think it looks great.
So, I mean, I think it looks great.
Everything's going in in there
Everything's going in in there
basically.
basically.
Uh, something like that, Jason. Is in
Uh, something like that, Jason. Is in
fact

planned.
But you don't like the the paint thing?
But you don't like the the paint thing?
I think it's pretty good.
I think it's pretty good.
There is actually a plan to have
There is actually a plan to have
a a big TV I can point to camera
at. All right. So, we got boys nicely.
at. All right. So, we got boys nicely.
Yeah. Uh, what are we doing here? The
Yeah. Uh, what are we doing here? The
only other thing I really want to get
only other thing I really want to get
done today, I got like 20
done today, I got like 20
minutes. I don't know what the heck is
minutes. I don't know what the heck is
wrong
wrong
with our
with our
probability
function. I would have sworn that I'd
function. I would have sworn that I'd
fixed it with the other thing, but it
fixed it with the other thing, but it
didn't work.
When's the release, Joseph? As soon as I
When's the release, Joseph? As soon as I
damn will finish it.
damn will finish it.
All right, I will get get back to doing
All right, I will get get back to doing
that. Uh, it's tricky to get to get
that. Uh, it's tricky to get to get
Grock to play Pokemon. Very very tricky
Grock to play Pokemon. Very very tricky

Yeah, that that's fine. I'm just living
Yeah, that that's fine. I'm just living

I've been working towards this new
I've been working towards this new
release. We've got some stuff going.
release. We've got some stuff going.
How's the uh how's your M going?
How's the uh how's your M going?
Uh well, I kind of haven't been working
Uh well, I kind of haven't been working
on it for a while. I figured I should
on it for a while. I figured I should
probably study some, you know, linear
probably study some, you know, linear
calculus and all that so I could better
calculus and all that so I could better
understand things. And then linear
understand things. And then linear
algebra or multivariant calculus, not
algebra or multivariant calculus, not
linear calculus.
linear calculus.
So, probably good to know linear
So, probably good to know linear
algebra. No linear algebra. Well, you
algebra. No linear algebra. Well, you
only need the calc is not bad at all
only need the calc is not bad at all
because you only need derivative
because you only need derivative
calculus and you need it to the extent
calculus and you need it to the extent
of like I don't know knowing chain rule
of like I don't know knowing chain rule
and that's about derivatives. Yeah.
and that's about derivatives. Yeah.
Yeah. Partial. That's all you need. It's
Yeah. Partial. That's all you need. It's
just like a tiny tiny fraction. Uh
just like a tiny tiny fraction. Uh
linear algebra is bigger but honestly
linear algebra is bigger but honestly
the thing that's most useful is just
the thing that's most useful is just
being comfortable with tensor
being comfortable with tensor
operations.

Yeah. like you know
Yeah. like you know
matrix multiplication vector kind of
matrix multiplication vector kind of
operations. Yeah, there are a handful of

streaming constantly. Yeah, just just
streaming constantly. Yeah, just just
hit a like a bench. I don't know, like a
hit a like a bench. I don't know, like a

Oh my. Yeah, dude. Do like a full stream
Oh my. Yeah, dude. Do like a full stream
where you're trying to reach 2K.
where you're trying to reach 2K.
Not
Not
just that's how you know you know what
just that's how you know you know what
Rabdo is cuz that's how you get You want

don't do it only for bench. Do it for
don't do it only for bench. Do it for
like like bench plus squats plus
like like bench plus squats plus
pull-ups plus whatever. Do you have any
pull-ups plus whatever. Do you have any
idea how Okay, I've done like I think
idea how Okay, I've done like I think
I've done like one star equals one rep.
I've done like one star equals one rep.
We're not looking for historical. We're
We're not looking for historical. We're
looking for the the difference between
looking for the the difference between
when you start stream to end stream.
I could do that. I don't know.
I could do that. I don't know.
Yeah, I just Great idea. Why? Just one
Yeah, I just Great idea. Why? Just one
stream where you try to reach 2k reps or
stream where you try to reach 2k reps or
2k stars. One star is one rep. Yeah. Oh,
2k stars. One star is one rep. Yeah. Oh,
yeah. Yeah. The different Yeah. Yeah.
yeah. Yeah. The different Yeah. Yeah.
You're right. You're right. Maybe I'll
You're right. You're right. Maybe I'll
do that when I get all my new gym
do that when I get all my new gym
equipment.
Yeah. Like for every star during the
Yeah. Like for every star during the
stream, you do a rep. Mhm.
So, I see a lot of
So, I see a lot of
enviable terminals. What exactly is that
enviable terminals. What exactly is that
used for? Dun.
used for? Dun.
What? So you know the done flag like
What? So you know the done flag like
reward obs like was it OBS rewards

Yeah, I think terminal is end episode.
Yeah, I think terminal is end episode.
Truncated is end experiment. Uh it's not
Truncated is end experiment. Uh it's not

Okay. I
Okay. I
don't even really need these to be
don't even really need these to be
honest. Yeah, that's that's what I mean.
honest. Yeah, that's that's what I mean.
Like for boys, is there really an
Like for boys, is there really an
episode? There's just one. I honestly
episode? There's just one. I honestly
don't even think that it matters that
don't even think that it matters that
much. Um
much. Um
I Yeah, you could literally just delete
I Yeah, you could literally just delete
duns and everything. Well, the thing is
duns and everything. Well, the thing is
that there are Ms where like there are
that there are Ms where like there are
Ms that you like you can construct cases
Ms that you like you can construct cases
in which the duns matter, but usually
in which the duns matter, but usually
they don't.
Makes sense.
This is the last the last thing I want
This is the last the last thing I want
to fix today which I can't figure out is
to fix today which I can't figure out is
why the hell we're getting nans now.
why the hell we're getting nans now.
We're only like we're getting nans when
We're only like we're getting nans when
we're getting bad hyperparameters which
we're getting bad hyperparameters which

Do you have like epsilon for protection?
Do you have like epsilon for protection?
I always have protection.
So, more about this major release. Is
So, more about this major release. Is
this going to be a 3.0 branch on your
this going to be a 3.0 branch on your
repo? I think it's going to be
repo? I think it's going to be
25. It depends how good the baselines
25. It depends how good the baselines
are. If we get ridiculously good
are. If we get ridiculously good
baselines, it'll be 3 0.
baselines, it'll be 3 0.
If even if it's a 2.5 release, do you
If even if it's a 2.5 release, do you
still plan on making that the main
still plan on making that the main
GitHub branch? Absolutely.
GitHub branch? Absolutely.
Perfect. Um, I'd just love to get my
Perfect. Um, I'd just love to get my
hands on the new bindings and I just I
hands on the new bindings and I just I
don't touch the dev branch if I'm being
don't touch the dev branch if I'm being
honest.
honest.
Well, well, dev the thing with that is
Well, well, dev the thing with that is
like main is always going to be it gets
like main is always going to be it gets
up to like up to six months behind. My
up to like up to six months behind. My
dev cycles are usually four to six
dev cycles are usually four to six
months. Sometimes it's two to two to six
months. Sometimes it's two to two to six
months, but yeah, it just it kind of
months, but yeah, it just it kind of
depends.
depends.
I mean, you can probably at least I
I mean, you can probably at least I
remember with like the plugin I created,
remember with like the plugin I created,
I had like basically this bot, this
I had like basically this bot, this
GitHub actions that would um kind of re
GitHub actions that would um kind of re
like I can choose when to release stuff
like I can choose when to release stuff
and it can create for me like a change
and it can create for me like a change
log and everything automatically just
log and everything automatically just
for my commits. So that might be a thing
for my commits. So that might be a thing
you want to look at.
you want to look at.
What's that? So I there's GitHub. So, if
What's that? So I there's GitHub. So, if
you're using a specific kind of like
you're using a specific kind of like
commit format, there's a GitHub actions
commit format, there's a GitHub actions
bot that can uh like automatically
bot that can uh like automatically
generate you all like the change log, um
generate you all like the change log, um
all like the release notes and stuff of
all like the release notes and stuff of
like this is what was fixed, this was
like this is what was fixed, this was
what changed, this is what was added and
what changed, this is what was added and
stuff. Um it can do that all
stuff. Um it can do that all
automatically and you can kind of decide
automatically and you can kind of decide
when you want to release that and it
when you want to release that and it
does all the version bumping for you and
does all the version bumping for you and
everything like that.
But that's like if you want to follow
But that's like if you want to follow
kind of the release cycle of like uh uh
kind of the release cycle of like uh uh
something you do with like uh semantic
something you do with like uh semantic
versioning. But from what I'm hearing,
versioning. But from what I'm hearing,
you would just want to kind of go by
you would just want to kind of go by
like feel pretty much. Well, the thing
like feel pretty much. Well, the thing
is it would be 0.1 point 2.3, but then
is it would be 0.1 point 2.3, but then
open AI and everybody kind of screwed up
open AI and everybody kind of screwed up
the whole versioning thing by going in
the whole versioning thing by going in
0.5s or like one increments. But like
0.5s or like one increments. But like
now nobody gives a if you release
now nobody gives a if you release
if I release this as 2.1 nobody cares,
if I release this as 2.1 nobody cares,
right?
right?
I would argue I think that was more so
I would argue I think that was more so
the game industry that messed up the
the game industry that messed up the
major minor patch versioning.
major minor patch versioning.
I don't know. I know a lot of open-
I don't know. I know a lot of open-
source projects still use that and like
source projects still use that and like
like but that's the thing. Yeah. Like
like but that's the thing. Yeah. Like
people don't like the hype is when kind
people don't like the hype is when kind
of a newer like a 1.0 or a 2.0 kind of
of a newer like a 1.0 or a 2.0 kind of
gets released.
gets released.
Yeah. Big number goer essentially. Yeah.
Yeah. Big number goer essentially. Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. This is just getting
nans into where telling you drop an
nans into where telling you drop an
epsilon. There is an epsilon. That
epsilon. There is an epsilon. That
doesn't help you when you have a nan.
That's actually fair. I I was You got
That's actually fair. I I was You got
NAND on, man.
NAND on, man.
Oh, wait. Hang on. Is it in the It could
Oh, wait. Hang on. Is it in the It could
be in the hyper
be in the hyper

Okay. Is it max minus min? Oh, wait.
Okay. Is it max minus min? Oh, wait.
Hang on. This I think I know what it is.
Hang on. This I think I know what it is.
Damn it.
Yeah, right here.
Linky, we were missing epsilon
Linky, we were missing epsilon
protection.
Epsilon strikes again.
Epsilon strikes again.
We We were in
We We were in
fact missing the epsilon.
Now, I'm not the most knowledgeable
Now, I'm not the most knowledgeable
person, but I'll take a decent shot in
person, but I'll take a decent shot in
the
dark. Oh, and hang on. This
is Where did the other one go?
Okay, look. I can't be expected to not
Okay, look. I can't be expected to not
ever miss an epsilon. Okay, this is it's
ever miss an epsilon. Okay, this is it's
a small indie company.
That's why we're we're here. We got to
That's why we're we're here. We got to
make sure, you know, sanity checks
make sure, you know, sanity checks
happen.
want to get this thing to not crash for

disappears to run. We will see whether
disappears to run. We will see whether
it is stable or not. In
it is stable or not. In
fact, we will
um this
thing. Why does teams mess with your VIN
thing. Why does teams mess with your VIN
theme as well? Sketchy.
You can use like a terminal with a
You can use like a terminal with a
built-in multiplexers. There's a lot of
built-in multiplexers. There's a lot of
them. Yeah, going to get ghost TTY at
them. Yeah, going to get ghost TTY at
some point.
some point.
I was going to say you could just verify
I was going to say you could just verify
that it's on like
that it's on like
uh 256 color, true color or whatever. If
uh 256 color, true color or whatever. If
you're using like fancy coloring, you
you're using like fancy coloring, you
have to change the color scheme of your
have to change the color scheme of your
terminal.
I just match them. So like
this GPC
this GPC
norm
norm
unlinearize. Oh, I did it right, didn't
unlinearize. Oh, I did it right, didn't
I? Here, one
I? Here, one
here. Where's Yorm? Ah, why
arm? Very good. We shall
arm? Very good. We shall
see how this does.
Okay, that is
Okay, that is
enabled. We've
enabled. We've
got there's probably more training steps
got there's probably more training steps
worth of data on this graph than most
worth of data on this graph than most
PhD students do in their whole
PhD students do in their whole
PhDs. Actually, it's way more than that,
PhDs. Actually, it's way more than that,
come to think of it. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Way
come to think of it. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Way
more.
more.
So, is each line in like a different
So, is each line in like a different
environment? Each one of these is an
environment? Each one of these is an
experiment run on neural MMO in which it
experiment run on neural MMO in which it
played 2,000 years worth of games.
Okay. And some cut short because why?
Okay. And some cut short because why?
Because like like what's your
Because like like what's your
termination condition? I guess it just
termination condition? I guess it just
wasn't working or some of them crashed
wasn't working or some of them crashed
or whatever.
or whatever.
But like yeah, the full ones on these
But like yeah, the full ones on these
are 100 billion steps, which I believe
are 100 billion steps, which I believe
is it 500 bytes
is it 500 bytes
each. So is that
each. So is that
um I think it's 500 terabytes of data
um I think it's 500 terabytes of data
each. Is that correct? 500 gigabytes or
each. Is that correct? 500 gigabytes or
500 terabytes? 500 terabytes.
500 terabytes? 500 terabytes.
It's a lot of data.
It's a lot of data.
Yeah. for so you said like you have five
Yeah. for so you said like you have five
million you know for a single run right
million you know for a single run right
it's a lot of data
yeah and this you can see the
yeah and this you can see the
progression where I think the 20
progression where I think the 20
baseline is around 2.5 2.6 six or
baseline is around 2.5 2.6 six or
something. So you can see the
something. So you can see the
progression
and uh Y I just want to make sure Y is
and uh Y I just want to make sure Y is
the reward and
the reward and
then X is
then X is
the episodes
the episodes
X is total steps trained
steps. It's quite nice. Mhm.
Hopefully maybe maybe with mine we can
Hopefully maybe maybe with mine we can
once it's done once voids is actually
once it's done once voids is actually
working we can sweep it and see what
working we can sweep it and see what
happens. Yeah. Yours is not going to
happens. Yeah. Yours is not going to
take a 100red billion steps to train. I
take a 100red billion steps to train. I
can guarant. Yeah. I know. Of course. Of
can guarant. Yeah. I know. Of course. Of
course.
But there's so much cool stuff that you
But there's so much cool stuff that you
can do with voids cuz like Yeah. I don't
can do with voids cuz like Yeah. I don't
know. It depends how much you want to do
know. It depends how much you want to do
with it. But like one thing that would
with it. But like one thing that would
be hilarious would just be like to put
be hilarious would just be like to put
it in the on the web page somehow. Not
it in the on the web page somehow. Not
just like as a thing you click into, but
just like as a thing you click into, but
have the puffers just swim around the
have the puffers just swim around the
web page. Yeah. As like an idol
web page. Yeah. As like an idol
animation or something. I don't know. I
animation or something. I don't know. I
mean, do you know it's kind of ripped
mean, do you know it's kind of ripped
off from David Ha.
off from David Ha.
David Ha. David Ha has this
David Ha. David Ha has this
awesome Does he still have it onto? No.
awesome Does he still have it onto? No.
See, he used to have all these like
See, he used to have all these like
multi-agent things. He used to do all
multi-agent things. He used to do all
this stuff. Now he does he runs like the

So, funny thing about that, uh, if

they'd actually if they'd given me a

You should have gotten the puffer

baseline working
properly. Puffer is just going to

There's so many implementation

a you don't have to you don't have to
a you don't have to you don't have to

port any of it. You just need the you
just need the environment and the
just need the environment and the

and it'll do better.
Like that's the idea. The goal is not
Like that's the idea. The goal is not
that we do exactly what whatever whoever
that we do exactly what whatever whoever
else does. The goal is that you just you
else does. The goal is that you just you
take your thing, you run it on puffer,
take your thing, you run it on puffer,
maybe you do a sweep, and we just
maybe you do a sweep, and we just
win like across the board. And it's
win like across the board. And it's
pretty well there. Like we're solving a
pretty well there. Like we're solving a
ton of different problems at this point.
How do I not make this multinnomial
explode? If you give this thing ins, it
explode? If you give this thing ins, it

I don't think it'll work without their

I think we'll do pretty damn well.
Do I just mask out imps
here? I think I just mask out

Well, but like you can use that version

of the codebase with puffer, right? We

just have like a gymlike interface or a
just have like a gymlike interface or a

Do they have Okay, I'm thinking the one
Do they have Okay, I'm thinking the one

ideally. So, if you had one of those,
ideally. So, if you had one of those,
you could just plug it into Puffer like
you could just plug it into Puffer like
because you could just match the VEC
because you could just match the VEC
interface to it. Um, and then you could
interface to it. Um, and then you could
still use our trainer and our sweeps and
still use our trainer and our sweeps and
stuff and our algorithm and we you'd
stuff and our algorithm and we you'd
still
win. Oh, wait. Is it
win. Oh, wait. Is it
not I forget if it's not process safe or
not I forget if it's not process safe or
not thread safe? Net hack. You'd have to
not thread safe? Net hack. You'd have to
check on

don't know.

I will spend at least three days
I will spend at least three days
seriously trying to make a a net hack
seriously trying to make a a net hack
based on work and puffer. I just think
based on work and puffer. I just think
it'll be hard. Okay, I'm very happy with
it'll be hard. Okay, I'm very happy with
that and I will very well help you when
that and I will very well help you when
you want uh when you want to see that
happen. Net hack isn't thread safe and
happen. Net hack isn't thread safe and
but NLE
is
is
interesting. I mean, you can always just
interesting. I mean, you can always just
run like the 16 processes or whatever uh
run like the 16 processes or whatever uh
with Puffer, but you're just you're
with Puffer, but you're just you're
limited to batch size 16, which
sucks. They make a copy of DL for each
sucks. They make a copy of DL for each
instance,
huh? Interesting.
huh? Interesting.
I mean, so
like does that mean that you can run
like does that mean that you can run
them on the same process or
them on the same process or
No, can you like load that multiple
No, can you like load that multiple
times and run them on the same process

or is that still messed up? I actually
or is that still messed up? I actually
don't know how that
works. Look, if you have unique state
works. Look, if you have unique state
and you can load me a thousand copies of

Net Hack, I think we insta win.
Net Hack, I think we insta win.
If you can do like a thousand copies of

Let's say we did like single node. Well,
Let's say we did like single node. Well,
single node distributed doesn't really
single node distributed doesn't really
help you because you're going to be uh
help you because you're going to be uh
you're going to be CPU bound. Um, but
you're going to be CPU bound. Um, but
like even if we just ran on like one
like even if we just ran on like one

two GPU box with a Thread Ripper on it,
two GPU box with a Thread Ripper on it,
like a 64 uh CPU Thread Ripper, like we
like a 64 uh CPU Thread Ripper, like we
should probably just
win. They can run hundreds on 10 CPUs.
win. They can run hundreds on 10 CPUs.
Yeah, but if they're opening just a
Yeah, but if they're opening just a
separate process per M is lame, right?
separate process per M is lame, right?
And also Puffer Libs Vec doesn't like it
And also Puffer Libs Vec doesn't like it
when you do
when you do
that. Like I could make a hacked version
that. Like I could make a hacked version
of it that wouldn't be as bad for that,
of it that wouldn't be as bad for that,
but it's just way better if you cannot
but it's just way better if you cannot
have them be single like for process.
I will actually help you with that
I will actually help you with that
though if you if you seriously want to
though if you if you seriously want to
do net hack stuff and like we'll put in
do net hack stuff and like we'll put in
time then I will also put in some time
time then I will also put in some time
to like make that work
well and like in your assessment like
well and like in your assessment like
was the rapper done competently?
Let's see if this fixes it.
We'll see if this still crashes.
They should be torturous,

Ah, that's a lame excuse
though. That's not a real excuse.
Like heck, if you want uh if you want to

Wait, it wouldn't be that
Wait, it wouldn't be that

Hello. Welcome,

people here this is this is pufferlib.
people here this is this is pufferlib.
This is what I work on full-time. Um it
This is what I work on full-time. Um it
is very easy to use and very high

performance reinforcement learning. So
performance reinforcement learning. So
like this breakout agent trains in less

And you can play them all on this
And you can play them all on this

But yeah, this is an open source
But yeah, this is an open source
project. So if we have any more
project. So if we have any more
technical folks around here, you do not
technical folks around here, you do not
need RL experience. Some of our top
need RL experience. Some of our top
contributors came in with zero RL
contributors came in with zero RL
experience
experience
um and are now like contributing tons of
um and are now like contributing tons of
cools to uh to the project. Great way to
cools to uh to the project. Great way to
learn AI and
learn AI and
RL. The thing that's most helpful is
RL. The thing that's most helpful is
having a little bit of low-level
having a little bit of low-level
programming
programming
experience. We write all these in C. It
experience. We write all these in C. It
is very simple C like first year
is very simple C like first year
undergrad level C very simple. Um but
undergrad level C very simple. Um but
yeah we try to really make like all this
yeah we try to really make like all this
complicated stuff pretty easy to work
complicated stuff pretty easy to work
with.
This is research is what it is. This is
This is research is what it is. This is
not just like developing a game. Like we
not just like developing a game. Like we
develop games as part of
develop games as part of
research. No, I'm a PhD in reinforcement
research. No, I'm a PhD in reinforcement
learning. I've worked on this stuff for
learning. I've worked on this stuff for
many years. I'm now trying to make it
many years. I'm now trying to make it
faster, better, more stable. uh useful
faster, better, more stable. uh useful
for hobbyists, people just having fun
for hobbyists, people just having fun
training RL on stuff, but also for like
training RL on stuff, but also for like
legitimate academic research and for
legitimate academic research and for
industry problems as
well. So that's kind of how it works
well. So that's kind of how it works
around here.
We're just going to do this for now.
not import exceptions. Yeah, we have to
not import exceptions. Yeah, we have to
refactor a whole bunch of stuff Now,
I don't know why I made all these little
I don't know why I made all these little
tiny files in the first place.
tiny files in the first place.
Frankly, this is just going to be so
Frankly, this is just going to be so
much easier.
When you get back from meeting, do you
When you get back from meeting, do you
want to go over a problem of having with
want to go over a problem of having with
action shape errors? Absolutely. I
action shape errors? Absolutely. I
didn't know that you were
didn't know that you were
here. I can look at stuff now. I don't
here. I can look at stuff now. I don't
like this guy. Of course, as soon as I
like this guy. Of course, as soon as I
start looking at your thing, I'm sure
start looking at your thing, I'm sure
he's going to message me. But for all I
he's going to message me. But for all I
know, he might not show up. He might do
know, he might not show up. He might do
whatever. He said whenever he finishes
whatever. He said whenever he finishes
his previous meeting, but that was
his previous meeting, but that was
supposed to be 7 minutes
ago. I don't have a clean commit state
ago. I don't have a clean commit state
though at the moment. So maybe let me
though at the moment. So maybe let me
finish this refactor and if he hasn't
finish this refactor and if he hasn't
pinged me by then then I'll do
it. What's going on? This is
it. What's going on? This is
reinforcement learning dev. Uh I build
reinforcement learning dev. Uh I build
puffer lib. All the stuff's at
puffer lib. All the stuff's at
puffer.ai. We've got demos. You can play
puffer.ai. We've got demos. You can play
them here. You can see RL agents trained
them here. You can see RL agents trained
in your
in your
browser. And uh I stream all my dev on
browser. And uh I stream all my dev on
this project. So ultra high performance,
this project. So ultra high performance,
simple to use, reinforcement learning,
simple to use, reinforcement learning,
research, algorithms, infrastructure,
research, algorithms, infrastructure,
all that. All open source and uh we're
all that. All open source and uh we're
always looking for new
always looking for new
contributors. Many of our best ones came

poking a little bit of fun at at Google
poking a little bit of fun at at Google
like it's cuz kind of lighthearted. just
like it's cuz kind of lighthearted. just
like ah well you know we did that two
like ah well you know we did that two
months ago with like one
GPU bots had me
GPU bots had me
rolling. I mean it like I don't know
rolling. I mean it like I don't know
people made a the Gemini and whatever

people got kind of buttth hurt over it.
people got kind of buttth hurt over it.
It was like it was like a little joke
It was like it was like a little joke
because it's like yeah obviously they're
because it's like yeah obviously they're
not the same thing but it's still it was
not the same thing but it's still it was
kind of funny the way they posted it
kind of funny the way they posted it
where they're like ah yes artificial

Pokemon intelligence and stuff. So, all
Pokemon intelligence and stuff. So, all
right, congrats on second place. We did
right, congrats on second place. We did
it a couple months ago with uh with

students who are interested in RL? I
students who are interested in RL? I
love your PhD presentation. Hey, thanks.
love your PhD presentation. Hey, thanks.
Uh right here, right here for uh if
Uh right here, right here for uh if
you're getting into RL, like this is the
you're getting into RL, like this is the
place. We've got a quick start guide

right here. This is much more

technically accessible than like even

something like spinning up. Uh it'll
something like spinning up. Uh it'll
link you to a singledigit number of
link you to a singledigit number of

you most of the important stuff that's
you most of the important stuff that's
out
out
there. And honestly, the best way to get
there. And honestly, the best way to get
into RL is to like build an environment
into RL is to like build an environment
like build a new problem from scratch
like build a new problem from scratch
and then go through the process of
and then go through the process of
making RL work on it. And with Puffer
making RL work on it. And with Puffer
Lib you can make that process very very
Lib you can make that process very very
fast. So you can train it a million
fast. So you can train it a million
steps per second. So that takes you like
steps per second. So that takes you like
two days instead of two months and you
two days instead of two months and you
can get help the whole way through
can get help the whole way through
because we are always looking for like
because we are always looking for like
if you're looking to get into RL frankly
if you're looking to get into RL frankly
this is like we try to make this a place
this is like we try to make this a place
where as long as you want to open source
where as long as you want to open source
stuff we help stuff out it helps grow
stuff we help stuff out it helps grow
the project and all the new Ms that
the project and all the new Ms that
people build in the process of this
people build in the process of this
become essentially tests for all the
become essentially tests for all the
algorithms that we build. Uh so it also
algorithms that we build. Uh so it also
helps advance the research as well.
I'm just nobody. You got fire.
What? I don't know what you're referring
What? I don't know what you're referring

That's a fun overview. It's mostly still

all relevant as well.
I hope people watch that thing. I put a
I hope people watch that thing. I put a
lot of work into that. That was how I
lot of work into that. That was how I
decided, okay, I'm not going to be
decided, okay, I'm not going to be
making YouTube videos. Um, it's just not
making YouTube videos. Um, it's just not
worth it. I I should be spending my time
worth it. I I should be spending my time
actually doing research and just do all
actually doing research and just do all
this stuff live.
no attribute puffer. It should
right you have a channel on YouTube.
right you have a channel on YouTube.
Yep. Um, I I'm here YouTube, which it
Yep. Um, I I'm here YouTube, which it
just streams to all the platforms and
just streams to all the platforms and
then all the VODs just go to
YouTube. They're not edited or anything
YouTube. They're not edited or anything
and they get cut up every time, you
and they get cut up every time, you
know, there's an internet outage or I
know, there's an internet outage or I
have to like go do a thing or whatever,
have to like go do a thing or whatever,
but you can technically you have all the
but you can technically you have all the
the logs up there.
This has got to be like some weird
This has got to be like some weird
import order thing,
right? Import puffer
lib. It's probably like imports too much
lib. It's probably like imports too much
stuff or something.
Oh, I wonder if this
is It's probably from
is It's probably from
pufferlib.pufferlib import star,
right? Yeah, that's
it. Yeah, that's why I messed up.
Yeah, maybe we will just leave it
Yeah, maybe we will just leave it
like like this.
3:15 Easter. Yeah, I don't know.
3:15 Easter. Yeah, I don't know.
I was supposed to have a meeting uh 15
I was supposed to have a meeting uh 15
minutes ago, but
iceberg vid is like a good
iceberg vid is like a good
overview the post on that I like I
overview the post on that I like I
should brought up on puffer.ai as well
should brought up on puffer.ai as well
that blog
that blog
post I mean I made those for new people
post I mean I made those for new people
looking to get into this
stuff most of the environments on

puffer.ai
AI.
Um, like most of those are from
Um, like most of those are from
contributors.
What happened here?
Oh,
Nice.
Yes. Okay, that's
Yes. Okay, that's
clean. Now, you can argue whether I'm
clean. Now, you can argue whether I'm
making it actually better or not doing
making it actually better or not doing
this
stuff, but I don't know. I I like it
stuff, but I don't know. I I like it
more this
more this
way. And it makes it way
way. And it makes it way
[Music]
[Music]
easier. It cleans up the name
easier. It cleans up the name
spaces. I should have done this a long
spaces. I should have done this a long
time ago.
Whether that's stable or not, who knows?
Whether that's stable or not, who knows?
But this is a dev branch, so who
cares? So now we have a whole bunch of
cares? So now we have a whole bunch of
stuff in this 450 line file instead of
stuff in this 450 line file instead of
having like five separate fiddly little
having like five separate fiddly little
files.
And if we look at what's in
uh in Pupper now, we've got
uh in Pupper now, we've got
emulation.py, we've got a little Sython
emulation.py, we've got a little Sython
code extensions, we've got
code extensions, we've got
models, got
pufferlib.py, got a CUDA kernel, we've
pufferlib.py, got a CUDA kernel, we've
got some C stuff in here. We have our
got some C stuff in here. We have our
pietorch
pietorch
stuff. We've got spaces. Got
stuff. We've got spaces. Got
sweeps. The only thing that I don't know
sweeps. The only thing that I don't know
about is
utils.
Hello.
Um, right. So, the thing I was doing
Um, right. So, the thing I was doing
before was I was just looking for dead
before was I was just looking for dead
code in here.
Yeah. So, this validate args, we get rid
Yeah. So, this validate args, we get rid
of
this. Do we still use get init
args? Okay, that's actually a little
args? Okay, that's actually a little
suspicious. Oh, you know what we did? We
suspicious. Oh, you know what we did? We
changed it to anything in the config
changed it to anything in the config
instead of anything in this init. So we
instead of anything in this init. So we
simplified a little
bit. I know we use unroll nested dict a
bit. I know we use unroll nested dict a
bunch.
We use this a
bunch. We still have this
install. No, we do not have
uh but we might have install and
uh but we might have install and
import. No, we don't use this
either for this.
Okay, we still use
this check.
En this gets used in
utils and in vector but I think vector
utils and in vector but I think vector
has its own checks.
Okay. So, this we don't use this
anymore. Why are you ignoring? Cuz
anymore. Why are you ignoring? Cuz
you're just saying random stuff in my
chat.
chat.
Uh, make zeros.
Okay. So this is I think we do use this
Okay. So this is I think we do use this
for tests,
right? So it would be compare space
right? So it would be compare space
samples I
guess. Yeah. So this is only used in
guess. Yeah. So this is only used in
tests it looks like.
So, we should move all of this stuff
into. We should move like this
into. We should move like this
stuff. How about compare arrays? Hang
on. So, all of this stuff needs to get
on. So, all of this stuff needs to get
moved here.
Get DT type
bounce. Okay, so this actually does get
bounce. Okay, so this actually does get
used.
So, I think we just take this stuff
So, I think we just take this stuff
here and we put this into like
here and we put this into like
a
temporary. We use this in two different
temporary. We use this in two different
places. I'll put this in test I for
places. I'll put this in test I for
now. Maybe
And I'll add a todo fix
And I'll add a todo fix
this was in
this was in
utils
only. Okay. So then there's get dtype
only. Okay. So then there's get dtype
bounce.
bounce.
This is only used in
emulation.py. Emulate native eyes.
is dict space. We use this type of
stuff. Nope.
There's no way this is
used. Yeah, I just like left a bunch of
used. Yeah, I just like left a bunch of
garbage in here.
Okay, so this actually does get
used only in tests.
This is in
um we have that in in clean puffer. We
um we have that in in clean puffer. We
do not use this
profiler or this or this. We replace all
profiler or this or this. We replace all
of this actually.
of this actually.
And then I believe we do use
suppress. We do use
suppress. We do use
suppress in several M's that are
suppress in several M's that are
annoying. Okay. Order dict doesn't get
annoying. Okay. Order dict doesn't get
used.
used.
Null context doesn't get used. Time
Null context doesn't get used. Time
doesn't get used.
doesn't get used.
OS OS gets used.
OS OS gets used.
Pickle subprocess
direct. Yeah, we use these redirects
direct. Yeah, we use these redirects
still ring io. We use
still ring io. We use
this
still wrap.
Now what we do is we take all
this and we move it to Here.
That's nicely
organized. 510
organized. 510
lines. Not bad.
I'm surprised you're using grap instead
I'm surprised you're using grap instead
of something like
of something like
telescope. I just don't use that many
telescope. I just don't use that many
tools.
Like I've like never really bothered to
Like I've like never really bothered to
get into using
get into using
very many tools like at
very many tools like at
all. I don't know. I use a pretty small
all. I don't know. I use a pretty small
set of pretty simple things.
Cool. That now that now works. That
Cool. That now that now works. That
should be a big uh commit diff.
Yeah. Minus 300.
code size getting smaller is
code size getting smaller is
good. So, aside from this, I think we
good. So, aside from this, I think we
only
only
have we only have uh clean puffl, right?
which is only like another
which is only like another
thousand. Oh, and this is also not the
thousand. Oh, and this is also not the
um the full line count, right? This
um the full line count, right? This
includes like whites space.
So once that gets moved
So once that gets moved
in, I mean 4,000 linesish for all the
in, I mean 4,000 linesish for all the
puffer pythons pretty
puffer pythons pretty
solid. I think it can even get smaller
solid. I think it can even get smaller
than this if we like work on some
things. And then obviously the uh most
things. And then obviously the uh most
of the expansion is in C.
of the expansion is in C.
And really if you think about it
And really if you think about it
like the actual stack that we use is
like the actual stack that we use is
probably half of this and the rest is
probably half of this and the rest is
like for emulation for stuff like
like for emulation for stuff like
Atari. There's probably stuff in PyTorch
Atari. There's probably stuff in PyTorch
we can delete as well. But this is I
we can delete as well. But this is I
mean this is like a pretty darn
good pretty darn good setup.
Let's um let's start taking a look at
Let's um let's start taking a look at
your
your
stuff. Plasma, let's start taking a look
stuff. Plasma, let's start taking a look
at your uh your code here cuz I don't
at your uh your code here cuz I don't
know where these guys
are. I don't know. This is like the
are. I don't know. This is like the
second or third time they've done this.
second or third time they've done this.
Well,
Please direct me as to where I should
look.
Perfect. I've been waiting for this one
Perfect. I've been waiting for this one
for a
for a
while. I've actually I really wanted
while. I've actually I really wanted
this amp to play around
with. Buffers, of course. Bonus points.
Is this um PR review or is there are
Is this um PR review or is there are
there issues that need to be
fixed? Okay, so this is the second time
fixed? Okay, so this is the second time
now I've seen this. Why Why does
now I've seen this. Why Why does
everybody have
everybody have
these? Like did you get these from
these? Like did you get these from
captain or from
uh these came from somewhere, right? Oh,
uh these came from somewhere, right? Oh,
from Bet. Yeah, this is from Damn it.
from Bet. Yeah, this is from Damn it.
Yeah, Bet didn't It's a lot easier than
Yeah, Bet didn't It's a lot easier than
this. Um yeah, Bet didn't understand the
this. Um yeah, Bet didn't understand the
way that we were doing stuff with our
way that we were doing stuff with our
VEC API when he did this. I can show you
VEC API when he did this. I can show you
how that works.
Yeah, this is about what it should look
Yeah, this is about what it should look
like. Something like this. I would
like. Something like this. I would
expect to see like a numbum agents param
expect to see like a numbum agents param
in here or something if it's not just
in here or something if it's not just
hardcoded. Oh, it's hardcoded. Okay.
hardcoded. Oh, it's hardcoded. Okay.
Well, it's hardcoded
Well, it's hardcoded
here. Huh.
here. Huh.
There probably should be a agents
here, but you want me to do uh leave
here, but you want me to do uh leave
comments on this so it's easier for you
comments on this so it's easier for you
to track
stuff. Just trying to get everything
stuff. Just trying to get everything
working. Okay, then let's let's actually
working. Okay, then let's let's actually
we we can do even uh I'm not looking for
we we can do even uh I'm not looking for
a review as of yet. Okay. So, what what
a review as of yet. Okay. So, what what
is it that you'd like me to look at
is it that you'd like me to look at
then? Like what is the thing that
then? Like what is the thing that
doesn't
work? Action shape bug. Gotcha. Gotcha.
work? Action shape bug. Gotcha. Gotcha.
Okay. I have multiple contributors and I
Okay. I have multiple contributors and I
I didn't remember whether it was you who
I didn't remember whether it was you who
had the action bug. Okay, cool.
weird. All right, but this is
weird. All right, but this is
built. Um, what was it?
Dash
local is in a
branch. Probably in a branch,
branch. Probably in a branch,
right? Create voids.
Okay, we should have
voids. Uh, is this thing supposed to
build? You wanna just push to your Yeah,
build? You wanna just push to your Yeah,
just push to your thing and I'll pull
just push to your thing and I'll pull
Just push to that branch and I'll pull
Just push to that branch and I'll pull
this real
Yeah, no worries.
It's like random stuff and then people
It's like random stuff and then people
shilling a crypto
shilling a crypto
scam. That's funny.
Oh yeah, in the meantime we can check.
Oh yeah, in the meantime we can check.
Um Oh, this is still crashing,
Um Oh, this is still crashing,
right? Wait, hang
right? Wait, hang
on. Didn't we start another sweep? What
on. Didn't we start another sweep? What
happened?
Oh, wait. The This is Pong. Yeah, we
Oh, wait. The This is Pong. Yeah, we
started a Pong sweep. That must have
crashed. That's
crashed. That's
annoying. I thought that that would have
annoying. I thought that that would have
fixed
it. Yeah, this is or breakout sweep.
Yeah, policy gradient
loss binary. Search
loss binary. Search
for
multinnomial. So it is screwing up in
multinnomial. So it is screwing up in
the multinnomial kernel.
Still kind of weird.
up a multinnomial kernel is
weird.
weird.
Enduro, you mean voids, right?
Dude, I love
Dude, I love
this. This is so
this. This is so
good. Oh man, I wanted one of these for
good. Oh man, I wanted one of these for
so long.
so long.
And it's funny because like I
And it's funny because like I
technically built something that you
technically built something that you
could sort of argue would work in uh in
could sort of argue would work in uh in
the grid system, but this is going to be

not import binding. So I I have to
compile this, right?
Uh, you did not add a binding here
Uh, you did not add a binding here
yet. Oh, how is this supposed to train
yet. Oh, how is this supposed to train
if there's no

man. Wait, how is this supposed to train
man. Wait, how is this supposed to train

because it's fast. We don't have virtual
M's. You see, like we're in containers.
M's. You see, like we're in containers.
So, like if you're stacking virtual M's
So, like if you're stacking virtual M's
inside of containers, it's like you've
inside of containers, it's like you've
put an MV in like I don't know. That's
put an MV in like I don't know. That's
that's got to be illegal or something,
right? Like putting a bag of holding in
right? Like putting a bag of holding in
a portable hole.
Yeah, it's helpful if you're not in a
Yeah, it's helpful if you're not in a
container, but we like our
container, but we like our
containers. Even for local dev, I have
containers. Even for local dev, I have
container like because I have an
container like because I have an
identical setup then right here and on
identical setup then right here and on
the
the
cluster. It's like it's just it helps so
cluster. It's like it's just it helps so
much to just have the full

container. That is something I am
working on
working on
Jason. I am working on that. But that's
Jason. I am working on that. But that's
only in
only in
dev. That is only in the dev branch.
Uh there is technically you do kind of
Uh there is technically you do kind of
need CUDA with the new stuff plasma.
need CUDA with the new stuff plasma.
There's um because we ship CUDA kernels
There's um because we ship CUDA kernels
and uh you need like a graceful CPU
and uh you need like a graceful CPU
fallback. So that is something that I am
fallback. So that is something that I am
working on. There will be a graceful
working on. There will be a graceful
fallback. I already figured out how to
fallback. I already figured out how to
do it. I just have to adjust some stuff
do it. I just have to adjust some stuff
in the setup.py
still. It took like four hours. It was
still. It took like four hours. It was
not fun.
Who agents?
There's one
There's one
M. No, hold on. Let me see what you did.
M some
M some
voids. So, this supposed to be one M and
voids. So, this supposed to be one M and
one void, except that the defaults will
one void, except that the defaults will
spawn two M's. So, it is two M's with
spawn two M's. So, it is two M's with
one void each, I
guess. Well, this is wrong.
The single the single space is for a
The single the single space is for a
single
single
agent. Each board is an agent.
Now, this is going to take absolutely
Now, this is going to take absolutely
forever because
forever because
um well, you have
um well, you have
one environment being passed.
Ah, now we get the error
again. All right.
3 to
three. Yeah. So, you set this to -3 to 3
three. Yeah. So, you set this to -3 to 3
and the policy is not doing anything to
and the policy is not doing anything to
clip this. So, you didn't even get to
clip this. So, you didn't even get to
this error, I assume, here. Um, but this
this error, I assume, here. Um, but this
would be you set it to like negative in
would be you set it to like negative in
inf or your policy has to clip it
inf or your policy has to clip it
somehow. So, we're going to set
Oops. Okay. So, you clip it, but you
Oops. Okay. So, you clip it, but you
clip it to the action space. So, this is
clip it to the action space. So, this is
too late cuz the check has already
occurred. You'd want to do something
occurred. You'd want to do something
like this.
I mean to be fair this is something that
I mean to be fair this is something that
I could improve on in the continuous
I could improve on in the continuous
API. Let me let me see about
that. Does this return any logs?
Yeah. One sec.
could be all right.
Well, this will run,
right? Those are just array lib leaks.
right? Those are just array lib leaks.
Yeah. Fine. Uh, float
episode. Let's see how you're doing your
logging. Is this Syon or is this um
logging. Is this Syon or is this um
bindings?
New C bindings.
Cool. So when does this termination get
Cool. So when does this termination get
called? Current void reward less
called? Current void reward less
than.99F.
So this is if they get to the edge of
So this is if they get to the edge of
the
the
screen. Is it possible for them to get
screen. Is it possible for them to get
this far? Cuz like don't they get cut
this far? Cuz like don't they get cut
off? Cuz like the puffer has some width
off? Cuz like the puffer has some width
to
it. Yeah. So the puffer is like isn't it
it. Yeah. So the puffer is like isn't it
going to get cut off way before.99?
Rewards are cumulative.
Rewards are cumulative.
That's
sure current. This is current void
sure current. This is current void
reward. And then this is set with a hard

currently helping Plasma here debug this

We're going to get reinforcement
We're going to get reinforcement

debugged. Can we move and just try
debugged. Can we move and just try
something real
quick? Make sure it's not a thing that I
quick? Make sure it's not a thing that I
could like easily guess. Oh, also you
could like easily guess. Oh, also you
have to uh manually for now purge old
have to uh manually for now purge old
builds until I figure out a way to clean

this
out. And now it's done
this. That is a new annoying quirk. I

will figure out how to fix that.
will figure out how to fix that.
Okay. So, the thing I suggested was

completely
wrong. A video for

RL. Well, I made a couple of them. The
RL. Well, I made a couple of them. The
thesis defense did really well. The one
thesis defense did really well. The one
after didn't. So, I just figured um
after didn't. So, I just figured um
mostly I just stream all the dev live
mostly I just stream all the dev live
now and I answer stuff while I'm working
now and I answer stuff while I'm working
on things. It takes a long time to make
on things. It takes a long time to make
videos and really the main objective
videos and really the main objective
here is to push RL forward. I can't be
here is to push RL forward. I can't be
doing research if I'm making videos all
doing research if I'm making videos all
day.
Okay, this is never getting called.
Current void reward
Current void reward
is reward
is reward
minus. This is a normalized thing.
All right. These rewards seem completely
All right. These rewards seem completely
wrong to me,
wrong to me,
right? Like it's mostly getting a ton of

Uh well it depends how much you go into

liib as

well I don't know if the right thing to
well I don't know if the right thing to
do is you get an intern as a research
student typically you just have to like
student typically you just have to like
meet and talk with professors for the
meet and talk with professors for the
most part
most part
Um it's very difficult to get a research
Um it's very difficult to get a research
internship uh as an undergraduate at
internship uh as an undergraduate at
like a a big lab or somewhere. You can
like a a big lab or somewhere. You can
get applied stuff, not really research
get applied stuff, not really research
stuff unless you're like you have uh
stuff unless you're like you have uh
some solid publication history and then
some solid publication history and then
yes, you can potentially do
yes, you can potentially do
that. But best bet is to do like uh
that. But best bet is to do like uh
stuff in academic labs.
So, I don't know what this reward
So, I don't know what this reward
function is supposed to be,
function is supposed to be,
man. But, um, whatever it is currently,
man. But, um, whatever it is currently,
maybe I can figure it
out. Let's see. So, reward is zero.
It also you don't have to make them
It also you don't have to make them
respawn ever, right? The the actual ones
respawn ever, right? The the actual ones
in voids don't ever respawn. I think you
in voids don't ever respawn. I think you
were just looking for a way to get logs
were just looking for a way to get logs
in, weren't you?
You can get actions into it with eval no
You can get actions into it with eval no
problem either
way. Heck, this thing still isn't
Well, that's
weird with diff optimization algorithms.
Um, I mean, yeah, like depending on the
Um, I mean, yeah, like depending on the
type of thing, it can either
be it's like anything from a basic
be it's like anything from a basic
exercise up to you built PyTorch,
right? Resnet and VGG from pre-trained
weights. That seems more substantial.
I mean, what what is your goal though in
I mean, what what is your goal though in
um like what's your goal in showing me
this? Like I can technically review
this? Like I can technically review
whatever ML stuff. Yeah. But we mainly

So
now yes that is why it is called single
Did I rename it to like agent or
Did I rename it to like agent or
something? I think I used this notation
something? I think I used this notation
from petting zoo though. I think that's

why I used this.
Oh, you know what this is? This is
Oh, you know what this is? This is
numbum m. Hang on. This is numbum m. Uh,
numbum m. Hang on. This is numbum m. Uh,
does this beckonet not do
It shouldn't matter when you call that
technically. I know I could be wrong. I
technically. I know I could be wrong. I
don't
know. Ah, because numbum agents is

What do you think of a new style of RL?
What do you think of a new style of RL?
Maybe instead of a neural network, you
Maybe instead of a neural network, you
could evolve a code
could evolve a code
base using
LMS. Uh, that's like Voyager style
LMS. Uh, that's like Voyager style
stuff. Yeah, that paper is mostly a
stuff. Yeah, that paper is mostly a
sham. and uh LM still absolutely suck at
sham. and uh LM still absolutely suck at
coding. Give it a couple of generations
coding. Give it a couple of generations
and maybe but even then like scripting
and maybe but even then like scripting
just doesn't work for all problems. Like
just doesn't work for all problems. Like
um it's good in some cases and bad in
um it's good in some cases and bad in
others. You're still going to want
others. You're still going to want
action
models, right? So you're getting log
here. That's a step up. It is actually
here. That's a step up. It is actually
calling your log function.
Yes, you need different like
Yes, you need different like
it's like go ahead and script me a Dota
it's like go ahead and script me a Dota

how? It's hard.

M's not get

I can imagine Dota being

doable if you have entity
doable if you have entity
base observation. You could maybe evolve
base observation. You could maybe evolve
an enormous
an enormous
codebase. It would be really freaking
codebase. It would be really freaking
hard. You know what? Actually, I have an
hard. You know what? Actually, I have an
example for you. Tesla tried really hard
example for you. Tesla tried really hard
to do this. uh they wrote 300,000 lines
to do this. uh they wrote 300,000 lines
of C++ and then replaced it with a

neural network. So there you
go. So that is and that is written by
go. So that is and that is written by
programmers that are much better at
programmers that are much better at
least you would hope many of them are uh
least you would hope many of them are uh
much better than current LLMs which are
much better than current LLMs which are
awful.
maybe driven by the observation space
maybe driven by the observation space
that is with them having classifiers and
that is with them having classifiers and
stuff for object
stuff for object
recognition. Still end up having 300,000
recognition. Still end up having 300,000
lines of
C++. It's very hard to script
C++. It's very hard to script
everything. And then there are places
everything. And then there are places
where it's actually way easier to script
where it's actually way easier to script
things, right?
I'm going to go put a breakpoint in
I'm going to go put a breakpoint in
inside the freaking Python binding
inside the freaking Python binding
itself because I don't know how this has

managed to be a thing. This is

Yeah. Um like air out like that should
Yeah. Um like air out like that should
be float. Well, it's tough cuz then you
be float. Well, it's tough cuz then you

you'll get to play with this. Yeah, cuz
you'll get to play with this. Yeah, cuz

well, your head was

Yeah, I can see it now. Yeah, the rack

safety straps. Those are really good.
safety straps. Those are really good.
Yeah, I highly recommend those. Yeah,
Yeah, I highly recommend those. Yeah,
for sure. If you don't want to die

squatting.
squatting.
Yeah, generally preferable to not.
And I like I like training to failure
And I like I like training to failure
sometimes as well. So, like it's better.
sometimes as well. So, like it's better.
What was the problem? I want I want to
What was the problem? I want I want to
know what was wrong with it. Oh, thanks.
know what was wrong with it. Oh, thanks.
Uh, I need to write myself a note to fix
Uh, I need to write myself a note to fix
that as
well. Uh, you pushed right. I I
well. Uh, you pushed right. I I
pulled. See?
So, uh, there were several issues. One
So, uh, there were several issues. One
was also like,
was also like,
uh, you didn't push yet.
So, the two main ones that were that he
So, the two main ones that were that he
didn't he did not initialize
didn't he did not initialize
um the number of agents in uh in the
um the number of agents in uh in the
environment itself. Actually, there were
environment itself. Actually, there were
three main ones. one had the single
three main ones. one had the single
observation space he was defining for
observation space he was defining for
all agents. It was the wrong shape. And
all agents. It was the wrong shape. And
then the uh environment was
then the uh environment was
exporting or the environment wasn't
exporting or the environment wasn't
exporting logs because it had it never
exporting logs because it had it never
got numbum agents in the initialization.
got numbum agents in the initialization.
So that needed to be fixed. And then uh
So that needed to be fixed. And then uh
additionally the log was an int. Like
additionally the log was an int. Like
the logs are intended to be all floats
the logs are intended to be all floats
right now. And we literally check
right now. And we literally check
numittes. How do we become an int? like
numittes. How do we become an int? like
I like how is it becoming an int because
I like how is it becoming an int because
I obviously put them all to floats when
I obviously put them all to floats when
I was when I was trying to make it work.
I was when I was trying to make it work.
Uh but that didn't make it work
Uh but that didn't make it work
because they have three different bugs.
because they have three different bugs.
Yeah, that's probably why. Uh okay. So
Yeah, that's probably why. Uh okay. So
observation shape was wrong. So So
observation shape was wrong. So So
plasma that that was that was one of one
plasma that that was that was one of one
of one of the I told you there's there
of one of the I told you there's there
are many like oneline gotchas. That was
are many like oneline gotchas. That was
one of them I think. So yeah. Cool. I'm
one of them I think. So yeah. Cool. I'm
I'm what I really just hope is that I
I'm what I really just hope is that I
can see the actions and the observations
can see the actions and the observations
and like I can actually see them being
and like I can actually see them being
passed down to see cuz with the Syon
passed down to see cuz with the Syon
they weren't. Yeah. Well, you can debug
they weren't. Yeah. Well, you can debug
now is the nice thing. So at least like
now is the nice thing. So at least like
you have break points. Exactly. Exactly.
you have break points. Exactly. Exactly.
And I saw you using GDB instead of uh
And I saw you using GDB instead of uh
PDB as well which is I did not know GDB
PDB as well which is I did not know GDB
can debug Python.
usually. Well, it'll it'll drop you into
usually. Well, it'll it'll drop you into
the C, which is nice, right? That's uh
generally just use PTB if it's if it's
generally just use PTB if it's if it's
in the Python
files. Yeah.
Um it's very nice. I
Um it's very nice. I
know. Yeah.
know. Yeah.
Have you pushed uh those changes? Yeah,
Have you pushed uh those changes? Yeah,
I pushed it. Okay. This is going to be a

fun end once we have it like doing stuff
as well. Oh yeah, it's going to be a

super fun. I think for you suggestions,
super fun. I think for you suggestions,
don't try to make it delete agents. You
don't try to make it delete agents. You
don't need to do that. You don't need to
don't need to do that. You don't need to
reset the end after like end steps or
reset the end after like end steps or
anything. Um yeah, don't delete agents.
anything. Um yeah, don't delete agents.
Don't I guess I mean Yeah.
So the ends. So like when you were
So the ends. So like when you were
saying like don't delete them, are you
saying like don't delete them, are you
just saying like don't terminate them?
just saying like don't terminate them?
Yeah, you don't need to terminate them
Yeah, you don't need to terminate them
at all. Yeah. So just to make Yeah, just
at all. Yeah. So just to make Yeah, just
make them like just get bad get like get
make them like just get bad get like get
very bad reward and it's just going to
very bad reward and it's just going to
be you know Yeah. And you can just log
be you know Yeah. And you can just log
at fixed intervals is fine.
This maze solver really good.
This maze solver really good.
Yeah, looks pretty good.

Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't know. I
I don't know. I
did uh what I do like three sets of push
did uh what I do like three sets of push
presses today and then I've just been
presses today and then I've just been
doing light like light bench sets of 15
doing light like light bench sets of 15
to 20 just every time I get up. Aside
to 20 just every time I get up. Aside
from that.
Yeah. Um, do you do any like calisthenic
Yeah. Um, do you do any like calisthenic
stuffs or like pull-ups? Uh, I do some
stuffs or like pull-ups? Uh, I do some
pull-ups. That's about it. Mhm. Have you
pull-ups. That's about it. Mhm. Have you
tried weighted pull-ups? Uh, when I did
tried weighted pull-ups? Uh, when I did
weighted pull-ups, my best was a two
weighted pull-ups, my best was a two
plate weighted for one. So, 245s. Yeah.
plate weighted for one. So, 245s. Yeah.
That's That's insane. Yeah. But now, you
That's That's insane. Yeah. But now, you
know, I really like this thing. I don't
know, I really like this thing. I don't
know if I'll be able to hit it having
know if I'll be able to hit it having
just benched, but this thing in the
just benched, but this thing in the
background, this is great. The the
background, this is great. The the
stepping thing, the
step. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I
step. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I
saw that. Was like
saw that. Was like
sick. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's like it's
sick. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's like it's
like it's it's like a salmon ladder, but
like it's it's like a salmon ladder, but
not like like a static salmon ladder.
not like like a static salmon ladder.
Yeah. Damn. Oh, is he going all the way
Yeah. Damn. Oh, is he going all the way
up? Uh, no, he
did. Yeah. Damn. Yeah, that's good.
Well, that thing's a lot of fun. Yeah. I
Well, that thing's a lot of fun. Yeah. I
mean, that that's good if you have the
mean, that that's good if you have the
budget for it. I'm running on budget.
budget for it. I'm running on budget.
So, what I do is I do like uh Do you
So, what I do is I do like uh Do you
know what front levers are? Yeah. I
know what front levers are? Yeah. I
don't do that type of calisthenics
don't do that type of calisthenics
stuff, but I know those. Yeah, I do that
stuff, but I know those. Yeah, I do that
and then I basically have all I need for
and then I basically have all I need for
calisthenics is a dip bars, a uh like a
calisthenics is a dip bars, a uh like a
chair and um like a pull-up bar with a
chair and um like a pull-up bar with a
weighted vest and that's all I need cuz
weighted vest and that's all I need cuz
then again I can just progressively
then again I can just progressively
overload. I mean technically all I need
overload. I mean technically all I need
is like just a base rack and a bench
is like just a base rack and a bench
with a bar but uh you know it's more fun
with a bar but uh you know it's more fun
to have it's more fun when you have a
to have it's more fun when you have a
bunch of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. You you have
bunch of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. You you have
your training you have your literally

know
yeah maybe
so uh we got your set oh
so uh we got your set oh
I just did so bet this is the
I just did so bet this is the
new this you'll find this interesting
new this you'll find this interesting
for
So this is what it currently looks like.
So this is what it currently looks like.
The puffer lib folder, the pi files in
The puffer lib folder, the pi files in
it. Interesting.
it. Interesting.
Very interesting. So
Very interesting. So
it's 3.3k total. Way fewer files. A lot
it's 3.3k total. Way fewer files. A lot
of stuff I moved all the little shitty
of stuff I moved all the little shitty
files I moved into just pufferlib.py.
files I moved into just pufferlib.py.
Okay. Oh, yeah. That's a new one. Yeah.
Okay. Oh, yeah. That's a new one. Yeah.
And then clean pufferell is going to go
And then clean pufferell is going to go
in here now. So then that'll bring us to
in here now. So then that'll bring us to
under 5k for the entire puffer python.
under 5k for the entire puffer python.
Like all the puffer python. So it's all
Like all the puffer python. So it's all
it's all going to be in the puffer lib
it's all going to be in the puffer lib
folder. Puffer lib. Puffer lib. Oh, I I
folder. Puffer lib. Puffer lib. Oh, I I
think I already showed you that I merged
think I already showed you that I merged
the demo file with clean puffl.
the demo file with clean puffl.
Uh no. Oh, so this is this is less than
Uh no. Oh, so this is this is less than
a thousand lines of actual code now. And
a thousand lines of actual code now. And
it has both. That's wild. You were you
it has both. That's wild. You were you
were Oh, you know what? No, I watched
were Oh, you know what? No, I watched
you editing it. I didn't I didn't look
you editing it. I didn't I didn't look
on the bottom to see what file you were
on the bottom to see what file you were
in, though. I just assumed you were in
in, though. I just assumed you were in
demo. Yeah. No, this is everything now.
demo. Yeah. No, this is everything now.
So, this is like there a couple bugs,
So, this is like there a couple bugs,
but it's like it's super condensed. And
but it's like it's super condensed. And
uh I mean, it's literally we're getting
uh I mean, it's literally we're getting
Well, except it's not
Well, except it's not
golfed. It's not golfed at all. That's
uh extreme extreme intensity because
uh extreme extreme intensity because
both of those files were kind of
both of those files were kind of
daunting. Yeah.
daunting. Yeah.
So the hope is this should just make it
So the hope is this should just make it
way easier now for people and like it's
way easier now for people and like it's
just a much thinner stack as well.
just a much thinner stack as well.
Um I think that honestly if I tried
Um I think that honestly if I tried
really hard I could probably cut another
really hard I could probably cut another
like 700 lines out of this thing but it
like 700 lines out of this thing but it
would take so much time. I'm gonna
would take so much time. I'm gonna
settle for cutting, you know, another
settle for cutting, you know, another
couple hundred out and we'll call it
couple hundred out and we'll call it
there.
So, I mean, I think it looks great.
So, I mean, I think it looks great.
Everything's going in in there
Everything's going in in there
basically.
basically.

But you don't like the the paint thing?
I think it's pretty good.
I think it's pretty good.
There is actually a plan to have
There is actually a plan to have
a a big TV I can point to camera
at. All right. So, we got boys nicely.
at. All right. So, we got boys nicely.
Yeah. Uh, what are we doing here? The
Yeah. Uh, what are we doing here? The
only other thing I really want to get
only other thing I really want to get
done today, I got like 20
done today, I got like 20
minutes. I don't know what the heck is
minutes. I don't know what the heck is
wrong
wrong
with our
with our
probability
function. I would have sworn that I'd
function. I would have sworn that I'd
fixed it with the other thing, but it
fixed it with the other thing, but it
didn't work.
When's the release, Joseph? As soon as I
When's the release, Joseph? As soon as I
damn will finish it.
damn will finish it.
All right, I will get get back to doing
All right, I will get get back to doing
that. Uh, it's tricky to get to get
that. Uh, it's tricky to get to get
Grock to play Pokemon. Very very tricky

How's the uh how's your M going?
How's the uh how's your M going?
Uh well, I kind of haven't been working
Uh well, I kind of haven't been working
on it for a while. I figured I should
on it for a while. I figured I should
probably study some, you know, linear
probably study some, you know, linear
calculus and all that so I could better
calculus and all that so I could better
understand things. And then linear
understand things. And then linear
algebra or multivariant calculus, not
algebra or multivariant calculus, not
linear calculus.
linear calculus.
So, probably good to know linear
So, probably good to know linear
algebra. No linear algebra. Well, you
algebra. No linear algebra. Well, you
only need the calc is not bad at all
only need the calc is not bad at all
because you only need derivative
because you only need derivative
calculus and you need it to the extent
calculus and you need it to the extent
of like I don't know knowing chain rule
of like I don't know knowing chain rule
and that's about derivatives. Yeah.
and that's about derivatives. Yeah.
Yeah. Partial. That's all you need. It's
Yeah. Partial. That's all you need. It's
just like a tiny tiny fraction. Uh
just like a tiny tiny fraction. Uh
linear algebra is bigger but honestly
linear algebra is bigger but honestly
the thing that's most useful is just
the thing that's most useful is just
being comfortable with tensor

I've done like one star equals one rep.
We're not looking for historical. We're
We're not looking for historical. We're
looking for the the difference between
looking for the the difference between
when you start stream to end stream.
I could do that. I don't know.
I could do that. I don't know.
Yeah, I just Great idea. Why? Just one
Yeah, I just Great idea. Why? Just one
stream where you try to reach 2k reps or
stream where you try to reach 2k reps or
2k stars. One star is one rep. Yeah. Oh,
2k stars. One star is one rep. Yeah. Oh,
yeah. Yeah. The different Yeah. Yeah.
yeah. Yeah. The different Yeah. Yeah.
You're right. You're right. Maybe I'll
You're right. You're right. Maybe I'll
do that when I get all my new gym
do that when I get all my new gym
equipment.
Yeah. Like for every star during the

stream, you do a rep. Mhm.
So, I see a lot of
So, I see a lot of
enviable terminals. What exactly is that
enviable terminals. What exactly is that
used for? Dun.
used for? Dun.
What? So you know the done flag like
What? So you know the done flag like
reward obs like was it OBS rewards

Yeah, I think terminal is end episode.
Yeah, I think terminal is end episode.
Truncated is end experiment. Uh it's not
Truncated is end experiment. Uh it's not

Like for boys, is there really an
Like for boys, is there really an
episode? There's just one. I honestly

don't even think that it matters that
don't even think that it matters that
much. Um
much. Um
I Yeah, you could literally just delete
I Yeah, you could literally just delete
duns and everything. Well, the thing is
duns and everything. Well, the thing is
that there are Ms where like there are
that there are Ms where like there are
Ms that you like you can construct cases
Ms that you like you can construct cases
in which the duns matter, but usually
in which the duns matter, but usually
they don't.
Makes sense.
This is the last the last thing I want
This is the last the last thing I want
to fix today which I can't figure out is
to fix today which I can't figure out is
why the hell we're getting nans now.
why the hell we're getting nans now.
We're only like we're getting nans when

Do you have like epsilon for protection?
Do you have like epsilon for protection?
I always have protection.
So, more about this major release. Is
So, more about this major release. Is
this going to be a 3.0 branch on your
this going to be a 3.0 branch on your
repo? I think it's going to be
repo? I think it's going to be
25. It depends how good the baselines
25. It depends how good the baselines
are. If we get ridiculously good
are. If we get ridiculously good
baselines, it'll be 3 0.
baselines, it'll be 3 0.
If even if it's a 2.5 release, do you
If even if it's a 2.5 release, do you
still plan on making that the main
still plan on making that the main
GitHub branch? Absolutely.
GitHub branch? Absolutely.
Perfect. Um, I'd just love to get my
Perfect. Um, I'd just love to get my
hands on the new bindings and I just I

don't touch the dev branch if I'm being
don't touch the dev branch if I'm being
honest.

Well, well, dev the thing with that is
Well, well, dev the thing with that is
like main is always going to be it gets

I mean, you can probably at least I

I had like basically this bot, this

you want to look at.
you want to look at.
What's that? So I there's GitHub. So, if

you're using a specific kind of like
you're using a specific kind of like

generate you all like the change log, um

But that's like if you want to follow

kind of the release cycle of like uh uh
kind of the release cycle of like uh uh
something you do with like uh semantic

versioning. But from what I'm hearing,
versioning. But from what I'm hearing,
you would just want to kind of go by
you would just want to kind of go by
like feel pretty much. Well, the thing
like feel pretty much. Well, the thing
is it would be 0.1 point 2.3, but then
is it would be 0.1 point 2.3, but then
open AI and everybody kind of screwed up
open AI and everybody kind of screwed up
the whole versioning thing by going in
the whole versioning thing by going in
0.5s or like one increments. But like
0.5s or like one increments. But like
now nobody gives a if you release
now nobody gives a if you release
if I release this as 2.1 nobody cares,
if I release this as 2.1 nobody cares,

I would argue I think that was more so

Okay, look. I can't be expected to not

I was going to say you could just verify

that it's on like
that it's on like

played 2,000 years worth of games.
Okay. And some cut short because why?

But like yeah, the full ones on these

are 100 billion steps, which I believe
are 100 billion steps, which I believe
is it 500 bytes
is it 500 bytes
each. So is that
each. So is that
um I think it's 500 terabytes of data
um I think it's 500 terabytes of data

500 terabytes? 500 terabytes.
500 terabytes? 500 terabytes.
It's a lot of data.
It's a lot of data.
Yeah. for so you said like you have five
Yeah. for so you said like you have five
million you know for a single run right
million you know for a single run right
it's a lot of data
yeah and this you can see the
yeah and this you can see the
progression where I think the 20
progression where I think the 20
baseline is around 2.5 2.6 six or
baseline is around 2.5 2.6 six or
something. So you can see the
something. So you can see the
progression
and uh Y I just want to make sure Y is

then X is
then X is

Hopefully maybe maybe with mine we can

once it's done once voids is actually
once it's done once voids is actually
working we can sweep it and see what

take a 100red billion steps to train. I
take a 100red billion steps to train. I
can guarant. Yeah. I know. Of course. Of
can guarant. Yeah. I know. Of course. Of
course.
But there's so much cool stuff that you
But there's so much cool stuff that you
can do with voids cuz like Yeah. I don't
can do with voids cuz like Yeah. I don't
know. It depends how much you want to do
know. It depends how much you want to do
with it. But like one thing that would

be hilarious would just be like to put
be hilarious would just be like to put
it in the on the web page somehow. Not

just like as a thing you click into, but
just like as a thing you click into, but
have the puffers just swim around the

See, he used to have all these like
See, he used to have all these like
multi-agent things. He used to do all
multi-agent things. He used to do all
this stuff. Now he does he runs like the
this stuff. Now he does he runs like the
national lab for AI in Japan.

Um he's kind of like their AI celebrity.
Um he's kind of like their AI celebrity.
Wow. I mean he's But the thing is he's
Wow. I mean he's But the thing is he's
legitimate. He's not just like he's done
legitimate. He's not just like he's done
like all sorts of cool work. He's Yeah,
like all sorts of cool work. He's Yeah,
he's not Sam Alman.
he's not Sam Alman.
Yeah, Alman is Man, it's freaking I wish
Yeah, Alman is Man, it's freaking I wish
it just I wish OpenAI had stayed like

Like, it was such a cool place. It's the

love So, did you work on the on the
love So, did you work on the on the
agents thing where they did the

hideand-seek thing? Cuz that was sick.
hideand-seek thing? Cuz that was sick.
So, funny thing about that, uh, if
So, funny thing about that, uh, if
they'd actually if they'd given me a
they'd actually if they'd given me a
full-time offer, I would have. I told
full-time offer, I would have. I told
them exactly what was going to go wrong
them exactly what was going to go wrong
with that project, and lo and behold, a
with that project, and lo and behold, a
year later, it went wrong in exactly the
year later, it went wrong in exactly the
way I told them.
way I told them.
Wow. It's it's it's such a cool project
Wow. It's it's it's such a cool project
though because the there were some

that I and that I told them would work.
that I and that I told them would work.
This stuff is all the appendix like the
This stuff is all the appendix like the
whole appendix of that paper is about
whole appendix of that paper is about
transfer learning. I told them it
transfer learning. I told them it
wouldn't work. I told them why it
wouldn't work. I told them why it
wouldn't work and lo and behold it
wouldn't work and lo and behold it
mostly didn't work.
mostly didn't work.
Yeah. Um but emergent tool use is a fun
Yeah. Um but emergent tool use is a fun
is a is a very cool project. Now the
is a is a very cool project. Now the
thing is if I had done it in puffer lib

3DMs. We'll expand to three Oh, we do
3DMs. We'll expand to three Oh, we do
already. Yeah, we have 3Ds.
Which ones?
I mean, don't we have a I could I'm

yeah, this is a 3D puzzler and right I
yeah, this is a 3D puzzler and right I

the 3D 2D distinction doesn't actually
the 3D 2D distinction doesn't actually
matter all that much like you know

Yeah, you are.
Um I think it's kebab case.
Uh it shouldn't be.

Is it just render then?
I don't know why he did this like this.
I don't know why he did this like this.
It's kind of silly. No, it's just it's
It's kind of silly. No, it's just it's
it's improperly named.
I don't know why it's a bull.
All right. Well, we'll have to fix it.
All right. Well, we'll have to fix it.
Render impulse wars is really cool. Uh,
Render impulse wars is really cool. Uh,
we got to get that thing working
we got to get that thing working

10. But when I'm doing freaking like
10. But when I'm doing freaking like
this type of shitty pre-release work,
this type of shitty pre-release work,
it's like it's more of a marathon where

the least productive times for me are
