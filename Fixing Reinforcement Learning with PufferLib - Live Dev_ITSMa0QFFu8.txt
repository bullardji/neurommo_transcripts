I love internet
I love internet
crashes just love me some internet
crashes just love me some internet
crashes stupid Linux drivers I
crashes stupid Linux drivers I
swear so
bad
bad
G so
G so
dumb well we're back
well e
oops let's see where stuff
oops let's see where stuff
went um
personal e
I wish wish I could evaluate one of
I wish wish I could evaluate one of
their
checkpoints I mean they run for like a
checkpoints I mean they run for like a
billion freaking steps I could do that
billion freaking steps I could do that
overnight I
guess
like the fact this is not consistent is
like the fact this is not consistent is
very
annoying I don't know why Wan be is this
annoying I don't know why Wan be is this
like a wanb setting that it's like
like a wanb setting that it's like
screwing with all my sampling
ah
jeez trying to think what I can
run it's like it's annoying because it's
run it's like it's annoying because it's
like oh just solve like a 100 scenes or
like oh just solve like a 100 scenes or
whatever and it'll work on way more but
whatever and it'll work on way more but
it doesn't freaking
eval
for e
um let me
think oh I'm just
tired start
here we
here we
[Music]
[Music]
go for
now we perf optimize the heck out of
now we perf optimize the heck out of
this
thing shouldn't take long I've already
thing shouldn't take long I've already
done the work I just have
done the work I just have
to fix the stuff that they slow
down goes to
one this goes to
one this goes to
oops 7
oops 7
six uh 16 K
maybe probably be good for
them oh yeah this
them oh yeah this
matches and
six e
up to me now
up to me now
to make of this work
solid
as Bas lines
let's see what we get perf
let's see what we get perf
wise oh for [ __ ] sake
Madrona
Madrona
freaking going Port this thing to CPU
freaking going Port this thing to CPU
and it's going to be faster
that'd be
that'd be
funny I do not have time to do that now
funny I do not have time to do that now
though that'll be after I clear and
though that'll be after I clear and
carbs and client
carbs and client
work every damn thing
else isn't it
384 yeah typ of the bat
size let's see what this gets
us how's the end keep freaking getting
us how's the end keep freaking getting
slower
slower
what the
hell dude the end every single time I
hell dude the end every single time I
check back the end is like somehow
check back the end is like somehow
slower it's supposed to be a million
slower it's supposed to be a million
steps a second and it's somehow slower
steps a second and it's somehow slower
every G like damn time
what e
I this should not be
how does this seem like how is it
slower
e e
I don't know how it is that every single
I don't know how it is that every single
time it's like something changes that
time it's like something changes that
shouldn't matter it's Sim is just 10x
shouldn't matter it's Sim is just 10x
slower again like this engine is just
slower again like this engine is just
not
good either that or they're using it
good either that or they're using it
wrong so
it's like good in theory if you have
it's like good in theory if you have
everything configured perfectly but as
everything configured perfectly but as
soon as you want to do like variable
soon as you want to do like variable
numbers of Agents or different scenes or
numbers of Agents or different scenes or
whatever it just
breaks okay we're going to do
breaks okay we're going to do
Network I'm changing their net
Network I'm changing their net
again getting rid of Dropout layer norm
again getting rid of Dropout layer norm
and all that s
H get get out of here we don't need
this
this
there
there okay and then if I do
this back to 250
200 what does a guy have to do to get
200 what does a guy have to do to get
his old perf back like I don't know what
his old perf back like I don't know what
the
the
heck like every single time
something it what is it 32
right that's
oh that doesn't
matter so
matter so
how what the heck was it
how what the heck was it
man what did they
change network
think I changed a couple other things
maybe I think I did like this
maybe at input
maybe at input
dim for
think I just did like
this how many more viewers are there six
this how many more viewers are there six
we lost internet for a
we lost internet for a
bit freaking Linux drivers I swear
yeah after it
yeah after it
crashed stupid I got to fix the drivers
crashed stupid I got to fix the drivers
I don't know what's wrong with
I don't know what's wrong with
it
yeah I don't care I'm doing work I'm
yeah I don't care I'm doing work I'm
trying to make progress on this
thing it's really freaking
obnoxious it's like every time I like I
obnoxious it's like every time I like I
turn like every time I look away the
turn like every time I look away the
perace back to what like the original
garbage yeah you
troll this was 250 mil this was
troll this was 250 mil this was
250 I don't know why it's no longer 250
250 I don't know why it's no longer 250
and it drives me insane
and it drives me insane
I work and I perf optimize stuff and it
I work and I perf optimize stuff and it
gets
gets
slow
somehow oh was it
somehow oh was it
this might have been this
okay that's it back to
okay that's it back to
perf it'll go up a little more with more
perf it'll go up a little more with more
num
worlds

e e
50k steps per
50k steps per
second with full
second with full
optimizations look if you tell me your m
optimizations look if you tell me your m
is a million steps per second and I
is a million steps per second and I
strip all the overhead and it's 50k like
strip all the overhead and it's 50k like
I can't do anything about that it's just
I can't do anything about that it's just
like your en isn't as fast as you
like your en isn't as fast as you
thought sorry
what you me is there a screenshot right
here it drops from 250 instantly just
here it drops from 250 instantly just
when you use their train
data you know I'm going to try something
data you know I'm going to try something
real
quick well yeah I mean that's the claim
quick well yeah I mean that's the claim
with GPU drive it's a million steps per
with GPU drive it's a million steps per

see those conditions
see those conditions
unfortunately
um I do this I don't I don't care at
um I do this I don't I don't care at
this point I'm just going to try to well
this point I'm just going to try to well
maybe get this one I'll
maybe get this one I'll
leave I just do this
just do your web dev and C it'll be
great does do

I don't understand
this oh is it building the wrong spot

can't do it
yeah I literally can't do [ __ ] for them

do not on the the main scenes at least
do not on the the main scenes at least
you'd have to filter

as far as I can

you just pretty much need a programming
you just pretty much need a programming
background to get into it that's about
it I really don't know what to do about
it I really don't know what to do about
this though because this number is not
this though because this number is not
going to go any higher
and the you got to know how to code
and the you got to know how to code
that's
it I can teach people how to write
it I can teach people how to write
better code but not how to
better code but not how to
code what did you I this is not on me
code what did you I this is not on me
now this is on the
now this is on the
Sim all I did was load their main data
Sim all I did was load their main data
files so it seems that whatever they
files so it seems that whatever they
have in the examples is like Optimal
have in the examples is like Optimal
conditions
conditions
um and whatever's in the training is not
optimal M really don't know what to do
optimal M really don't know what to do
with this is the thing because
with this is the thing because
like you can't really do anything with
like you can't really do anything with
50k it's too
slow I mean that's like a billion an
slow I mean that's like a billion an
hour to a billion 10
hour to a billion 10
hours well you were running I was
hours well you were running I was
running the example scene just different
running the example scene just different
data files that they gave me for testing
data files that they gave me for testing
but it seems like their actual data
but it seems like their actual data
files are substantially
slower I mean unless I'm do I don't
slower I mean unless I'm do I don't
think I'm doing anything stupid here
well I mean I could rewrite this an and
well I mean I could rewrite this an and
it would be a million steps a
it would be a million steps a
second I I'm not doing it now obviously
second I I'm not doing it now obviously
but we can look at it it's
but we can look at it it's
like I don't think it's that
like I don't think it's that
crazy like we could do the render very
crazy like we could do the render very
easily I think that the main thing
easily I think that the main thing
it's so there's a 700 some modline Sim
it's just using all this weird entity
it's just using all this weird entity
component
Shenanigans I mean this is just
like there's like basic collision and
like there's like basic collision and
stuff but
we could do this with or probably even
we could do this with or probably even
without box
2D maybe
with madron we don't need
with madron we don't need
this that's
this that's
nothing 500 lines of oh these are just
nothing 500 lines of oh these are just
structs
most of which are
redundant
redundant
OB
OB
tiny okay this has some
tiny okay this has some
code yeah but this is
rendering
manager this is
rendering seems
right and then there's CPU stuff I
right and then there's CPU stuff I
wouldn't worry about
wouldn't worry about
this level gen not that
this level gen not that
bad they got a Cann in
bad they got a Cann in
here in
it I mean there's like
it I mean there's like
maybe 2,000 lines of like real code in
maybe 2,000 lines of like real code in
here or
less map
less map
R yeah it's not that
bad it would probably need either box 2D
bad it would probably need either box 2D
or we'd have to do our Min version of
it
for
e
e
e e
H chatting with e jene
I
mean I wonder if anybody in the Discord
mean I wonder if anybody in the Discord
would actually like to help with
would actually like to help with
this I could definitely get it set up in
started it's like I'm tempted to do this
started it's like I'm tempted to do this
one myself but this one would take I
one myself but this one would take I
mean it would take a bit of
work render probably wouldn't be that
work render probably wouldn't be that
bad could probably make it substantially
bad could probably make it substantially
better as well
this does
work
work
well no we could definitely get at a
well no we could definitely get at a
million we can definitely get this a
million we can definitely get this a
million it's not like it's not that
million it's not like it's not that
heavy of an Environ ironment
it's just a pain because it's like it's
it's just a pain because it's like it's
hard to get people from Academia to
hard to get people from Academia to
actually help on this type of stuff cuz
actually help on this type of stuff cuz
there're always like papers papers
there're always like papers papers
papers and it's
papers and it's
like you can't you got to invest in your
like you can't you got to invest in your
infra or it's just going to be too slow
infra or it's just going to be too slow
for you to do anything and you're just
for you to do anything and you're just
going to be sad and that's just how it's
going to be sad and that's just how it's
going to be
I
I
mean I'm trying to think what I can even
mean I'm trying to think what I can even
do with
this I can technically run a hyper
this I can technically run a hyper
parameter
parameter
sweep like the with these
sweep like the with these
pams what we got Lambda Gamma entropy
maybe it finds something
right I mean I may as well it's kind of
right I mean I may as well it's kind of
free but it's just like it's pretty
silly no I mean maybe I can find him
silly no I mean maybe I can find him
somewhat better hyper
parameters they like look they literally
parameters they like look they literally
haven't tuned the hyper parameters at
haven't tuned the hyper parameters at
all because of how slow it is you see
all because of how slow it is you see
this zero hyper parameter
this zero hyper parameter
tuning
tuning
zero it's like the most important thing
zero it's like the most important thing
to do in the field and they can't even
to do in the field and they can't even
do it because the thing is too slow
I mean I could tune on the example M's
I mean I could tune on the example M's
and hope that that transfers but you
and hope that that transfers but you
know I doubt
it yeah the thing that actually fix the
it yeah the thing that actually fix the
problem here would
be May maybe I could do it if I were
be May maybe I could do it if I were
like on point I could maybe do it in a
like on point I could maybe do it in a
couple
weeks it's a fair bit of work to put in
weeks it's a fair bit of work to put in
for a for a
collab and the thing is people are so
collab and the thing is people are so
freaking dumb that they'll like they'll
freaking dumb that they'll like they'll
count um High per against you like even
count um High per against you like even
so GPU drive at the very least they
so GPU drive at the very least they
released it training at like 30,000 30
released it training at like 30,000 30
something thousand steps per second I
something thousand steps per second I
got a DM I got people like telling me
got a DM I got people like telling me
that like it's too simple because it was
that like it's too simple because it was
90% solved on day one whereas this other
90% solved on day one whereas this other
SIM has been out for years and isn't
SIM has been out for years and isn't
solved and the other SIM runs 10 steps
solved and the other SIM runs 10 steps
per second so it's fundamentally
per second so it's fundamentally
impossible you
know yeah
I mean I wonder how much time it would
I mean I wonder how much time it would
take to get the basics in place you
know I really don't like the Box 2D
know I really don't like the Box 2D
dependency as the problem I really don't
dependency as the problem I really don't
like the freaking physics Sim dependency
like the freaking physics Sim dependency
it's such a pain
honestly
like we should just have our own like
like we should just have our own like
basic set of physics utils it really
basic set of physics utils it really
wouldn't be that
hard we just drop them right in the file
hard we just drop them right in the file
for whatever we just like a b like BAS
for whatever we just like a b like BAS
basic bounding box checks and stuff like
basic bounding box checks and stuff like
that you know just like angled bounding
that you know just like angled bounding
box checks stuff like
box checks stuff like
that couple couple
strs I don't know I kind of want to set
strs I don't know I kind of want to set
up some other some better hyper prams
up some other some better hyper prams
stuff at the moment I'm trying to think
stuff at the moment I'm trying to think
I got to do uh client stuff on physics
I got to do uh client stuff on physics
tomorrow for
tomorrow for
sure upgrade from ssw dude have you seen
sure upgrade from ssw dude have you seen
the stuff I've been building we're
the stuff I've been building we're
already
there we've been there a
while it's not even a difficulty thing
while it's not even a difficulty thing
at this point it's a time thing
it's just that 2,000 3,000 lines of code
it's just that 2,000 3,000 lines of code
is 50 lines a page 40 to 60 pages of
is 50 lines a page 40 to 60 pages of
code it's just still a bunch of code to
write more gpus less
write more gpus less
problems I still got to go receip that
problems I still got to go receip that
freaking is it just box five that's
freaking is it just box five that's
acting up that guy or is there other
acting up that guy or is there other
ones obviously four is
dead currently okay I'll go see if I can
dead currently okay I'll go see if I can
reat it I really hope that the GPU isn't
reat it I really hope that the GPU isn't
like somehow
screwed do you have a PR
can we get captain to try it on his M to
can we get captain to try it on his M to
see if it speeds stuff
up pretty
exhausted this is
uh it's been a fair bit of
uh it's been a fair bit of
work I can't even like submit this as
work I can't even like submit this as
the thing it's like yeah their current
the thing it's like yeah their current
Network architecture is better and stuff
Network architecture is better and stuff
cuz they're hard bottlenecked on the end
anyways I stripped like all the
anyways I stripped like all the
overhead what's the
overhead what's the
problem I optimize this to a quar
problem I optimize this to a quar
million steps per second up from
million steps per second up from
35k on uh the example tasks but as soon
35k on uh the example tasks but as soon
as you load the train tasks it drops
as you load the train tasks it drops
right back down to
right back down to
50K it's just the engine is not
50K it's just the engine is not
good they have this very F fancy GPU
good they have this very F fancy GPU
engine that's great for what it's good
engine that's great for what it's good
at but this ain't it like they have
at but this ain't it like they have
because they have variable numbers of
because they have variable numbers of
agents and such it's just not good for
that I mean that's what they gave me
but I mean I was assured that it was
but I mean I was assured that it was
going to be
fast I mean unless there's some setting
fast I mean unless there's some setting
I'm missing but I don't think there
is I mean I was I shed repeatedly that
is I mean I was I shed repeatedly that
this thing
this thing
had I mean it it is in the optimal case
had I mean it it is in the optimal case
it's um I think for any like one scam
it's um I think for any like one scam
size you can probably get it to that
performance but like I think it will
performance but like I think it will
literally be the same amount of code as
literally be the same amount of code as
it is now if we just do it and
see just the N it's the fact that they
see just the N it's the fact that they
have to load everything into fix size
have to load everything into fix size
buffers and uh the train set the train
buffers and uh the train set the train
set is less agent D is lower agent
set is less agent D is lower agent
density than the example set
density than the example set
something like
that that it could technically
that that it could technically
be the environment resets or I don't
be the environment resets or I don't
freaking know I'm tired
um
um
yeah I mean I did my part I optimized it
yeah I mean I did my part I optimized it
as much as it could be
as much as it could be
optimized it's it's up a little bit of
optimized it's it's up a little bit of
performance from
before I cut as much overhead as I could
before I cut as much overhead as I could
it scales now so if the Sim as fast
it scales now so if the Sim as fast
it'll go
it'll go
bur somewhat disappointing
though all I got time to do at the
though all I got time to do at the
moment is potentially queue up some um
queue up some experiments figure out
queue up some experiments figure out
maybe I can figure out a couple things
maybe I can figure out a couple things
on uh on carbs and go to
on uh on carbs and go to
bed I came up with another good test for
bed I came up with another good test for
it and some more potential modifications
it and some more potential modifications
but I think even the current version
but I think even the current version
will be
good is it hard to make up
good is it hard to make up
ends yeah they're loaded from Real uh
ends yeah they're loaded from Real uh
real traffic scenarios
so that's a data set like each of these
so that's a data set like each of these
is a real
scenario I don't
scenario I don't
know I'm going to go back to my puffer
know I'm going to go back to my puffer
container
okay let's see how our current
okay let's see how our current
experiments are
experiments are
going we found a few limitations with
going we found a few limitations with
the neoc carbs it's still better than
the neoc carbs it's still better than
the old thing by a huge amount but it's
the old thing by a huge amount but it's
not the god algorithm
not the god algorithm
yet it's going to take a little more
yet it's going to take a little more
work to be the god algorithm
yeah so this is an issue it's cost it
yeah so this is an issue it's cost it
might be pushing cost down here a little
might be pushing cost down here a little
bit we'll
bit we'll
see let
say uh
say uh
it's not filling in the parito front the
it's not filling in the parito front the
way I would like it
way I would like it
to it's only got 60 runs so maybe by the
to it's only got 60 runs so maybe by the
end we'll
end we'll
see I don't
know like to get this running on more
know like to get this running on more
things what was
things what was
um hang
um hang
on yeah I ran this one
on yeah I ran this one
here and hung on this
triple
Triad and a ban
actually can I see is there anything
actually can I see is there anything
suspicious about this triple Triad
suspicious about this triple Triad
curve I should check that
first
score how's the
score how's the
oh
oh
cost that high
oh it's just got one
point is there an infinite in um triple
point is there an infinite in um triple
Triad
Triad
this one looks
great oh there is an infinite isn't
great oh there is an infinite isn't
there hang
on damn
it anything with a noop is has an
it anything with a noop is has an
infinite
unfortunately if the game doesn't punish
unfortunately if the game doesn't punish
you for
it let's go look at
this select
card yeah you can spam select you can
card yeah you can spam select you can
spam uh you can spam select and you can
spam uh you can spam select and you can
spam no op
spam no op
okay
um we're going to have to change some
um we're going to have to change some
stuff I
think do you remove well there's no
think do you remove well there's no
reason to have a no
reason to have a no
Al literally there's no
reason e
so this reward is not enough
we could just cap the episode length
so we'll just
so we'll just
do if and
infinitees for
okay so we do
this
e
e
e e
yeah this is good
okay so we're going to try this
May it's not
used oh this is action
what going on
here e
the Leng KN get reset or something
and
clear add
vog
vog
set yeah this is gets reset
not really I'm just tired it's just
not really I'm just tired it's just
taking a while
oh I'm in that skill
issue that's just skill
isue so we get
isue so we get
[Music]
[Music]
action = to
-1 action
-1 action
equal
actions
this 4 13 5 3
doing all sorts of
stuff you have render
stuff you have render
render should have
um
tick going to go see you
tick going to go see you
later dude I got to go all the way the
later dude I got to go all the way the
[ __ ] down to the that's happening
[ __ ] down to the that's happening
tomorrow
I'm finishing this and going to
sleep okay um
oh I
oh I
see this goes here
this get stuck instantly it's
this get stuck instantly it's
weird it's probably in the mend
weird it's probably in the mend
code whatever I did to that
reset the
game for
I don't understand what's wrong with
this I don't know how I could have
this I don't know how I could have
possibly broken it
good I'm just going to go GDB this I
good I'm just going to go GDB this I
don't
know for
and screws up the
renderer e
oh okay so this is why the the model
oh okay so this is why the the model
needs to be retrained obviously cuz it's
needs to be retrained obviously cuz it's
going to try to place the
card forever we just going to try to
card forever we just going to try to
place this card
so it's probably just the human actions
so it's probably just the human actions
that are screwed up
and
interesting okay
okay it's not passing actions to the
okay it's not passing actions to the
freaking I I know what it is it's just
freaking I I know what it is it's just
not passing actions
too yeah I just screwed this
up so we just do
n it's just it's literally just this
okay and now if I do like
this
interesting I appear at the
interesting I appear at the
permissioning [ __ ] with my
Docker I just press three and it
Docker I just press three and it
selected card
two okay
selected minus one
got place
got place
card action minus
five I actually don't know how that
works for
how is this
working do this
okay and then minus
okay and then minus
5 hang
on there minus one
what the heck
oh
my4 still no
seriously
there's the Heap overflow
why is there no symbolizer
what the what's the damn package
literally L duh
literally L duh
that was
symbolizer
symbolizer
fine here's the
end and we get the
end and we get the
trace which
is six
card selected of player index
is there a minus five
somewhere e
you know is it this wait card placement
you know is it this wait card placement
minus
one it's got to be this
right no that's doesn't
right no that's doesn't
help that screws it up
instantly e
what in the
hell I mean this is
insane literally how is it this much of
insane literally how is it this much of
a
a
mess dude like how
maybe I do
maybe I do
this and then
four how about
this buffer are you kidding me
how oh wait hold on
did
action one
and it'll
set
set
right it's stuck cuz this is an old
right it's stuck cuz this is an old
model and it's mapping
actions y so there it go reset
we'll see if this fixes
we'll see if this fixes
it and then I can go to
it and then I can go to
bed having
bed having
accomplished a great many things
see if this instantly say
faults then we'll call
faults then we'll call
tonight soon as we get these experiments
tonight soon as we get these experiments
up been
running let's see if this egg
running let's see if this egg
faults some
[ __ ] oh
[ __ ] oh
ho so hopefully this makes it impossible
ho so hopefully this makes it impossible
to infinite
to infinite
loop I would
hope that's what was happening
hope that's what was happening
previously I
believe and was just infinite
believe and was just infinite
looping wasn't getting any logs
back there go wasn't logging
anything we'll
see like this for instance did bad to
see like this for instance did bad to
the pipers
it's just
stuck now we'll hope that this is not
stuck now we'll hope that this is not
you know all of them
do I do something that would break this
do I do something that would break this
or is this just a Bas of
or is this just a Bas of
hypers guess we'll find out in a second
hypers guess we'll find out in a second
but I do want to take a quick look to
but I do want to take a quick look to
make
sure game over gets set to one
episode return goes to negative
one so it must just be running out of
one so it must just be running out of
time here spamming uh spamming Act or
time here spamming uh spamming Act or
something it can spam
something it can spam
select but it should be getting a
select but it should be getting a
negative reward for
negative reward for
that hang on what could it actually be
doing think we'll wait for the next
doing think we'll wait for the next
experiment but if the next one is also
experiment but if the next one is also
like this then
yeah it gets punished for selecting bad
yeah it gets punished for selecting bad
actions
it shouldn't be able to have um a return
it shouldn't be able to have um a return
of negative one like this
one good thing I caught this
anyways now this is
anyways now this is
broken for
okay so episode return
let's see what it's doing
wa
okay
for resetting instantly without doing
for resetting instantly without doing
anything
oh I know what it
is it's funny that it figures that
out that it doesn't get Negative reward
out that it doesn't get Negative reward
if it
if it
spams that's really clever
spams that's really clever
actually freaking RL just
now you can't do it anymore can you
now you can't do it anymore can you
haha have defeated
you you semi
you you semi
sentient reinforcement learning
algorithm and now you shall run many
algorithm and now you shall run many
experiments for me
without
halting she'll run very very many
halting she'll run very very many
experiments without halting
and actually I can go set
and actually I can go set
the this can be
30 you only you only really need 10
30 you only you only really need 10
actions you be
actions you be
20 we'll leave it at 30
it just changed this Why didn't it uh
the
the
heck now whatever it'll be the
same rebuild this
same rebuild this
one there it
one there it
goes oh it is
rebuilding this one
perfect
perfect

sweep
oh and I'm so tired I got to get this
oh and I'm so tired I got to get this
done I just gave you my API token stupid
done I just gave you my API token stupid
thing give me AP I
thing give me AP I
took
have one my expense
episode return locked to
3.9 I mean what are the odds that that's
3.9 I mean what are the odds that that's
literally uh I just saw the actual
literally uh I just saw the actual
training work okay
training work okay
that could
that could
be what you get for spamming bad
actions that would say that there's no
actions that would say that there's no
the seating is working which would be
the seating is working which would be
interesting
I'm going to watch it for a few
I'm going to watch it for a few
minutes see if it's
working I'm going to say that this is
working I'm going to say that this is
still possibly just very bad hypers
let's see if this gets stuck at 39
it does but after a bit of
it does but after a bit of
uh uh it's not like locked to
uh uh it's not like locked to
it it could just be that like too high
it it could just be that like too high
learning rate or too high whatever
learning rate or too high whatever
is you know
I want to at least see a decent set of
hypers that's too ambitious it's already
hypers that's too ambitious it's already
10 I'm going go reply to an email on
10 I'm going go reply to an email on
this side real
this side real
quick and
uh
for
e
e
e
e
e
e e
a quick
invite
okay e
it's
good
good
okay you know we're learning stuff here
okay you know we're learning stuff here
it's just uh there's some bad hypers in
it's just uh there's some bad hypers in
this environment that you can't get
this environment that you can't get
around apparently they just craft right
around apparently they just craft right
out that's fine
we are
we are
good
good
oops it's
late there we go
I will let this one run
overnight
overnight
um do I cue something else
um do I cue something else
up I guess I may as well
I don't think there's a num
Ms oh no there is num
M it's four
so it'll be 1 through eight I
so it'll be 1 through eight I
guess for this
this should be
like
like
eight 1 through eight 2 through
eight 1 through eight 2 through
eight 1 through
eight 1 through
eight I think one is still
eight I think one is still
fine yeah cuz it's Vector as two are
fine yeah cuz it's Vector as two are
good so we have the
good so we have the
rewards we got
58 um
58 um
and then
and then
maximize it's
maximize it's
Min com
Min com
c so I'll have to add a panel for this
c so I'll have to add a panel for this
but otherwise this should
but otherwise this should
be it should be
fine let's see if this this
runs oh wait I have something running
runs oh wait I have something running
already we're good to go for the evening
already we're good to go for the evening
I'll let that one finish before I do
I'll let that one finish before I do
anything else we'll be good got both
anything else we'll be good got both

it doesn't freaking

six uh 16 K
maybe probably be good for
them oh yeah this
them oh yeah this
matches and
six e
up to me now
up to me now
to make of this work
solid
as Bas lines
let's see what we get perf
let's see what we get perf

freaking going Port this thing to CPU
freaking going Port this thing to CPU
and it's going to be faster
that'd be
that'd be
funny I do not have time to do that now

else isn't it
384 yeah typ of the bat
size let's see what this gets
us how's the end keep freaking getting
us how's the end keep freaking getting
slower
slower
what the
hell dude the end every single time I
hell dude the end every single time I
check back the end is like somehow
check back the end is like somehow
slower it's supposed to be a million
slower it's supposed to be a million
steps a second and it's somehow slower
steps a second and it's somehow slower
every G like damn time
what e
I this should not be
how does this seem like how is it
slower
e e
I don't know how it is that every single
I don't know how it is that every single
time it's like something changes that
time it's like something changes that
shouldn't matter it's Sim is just 10x
shouldn't matter it's Sim is just 10x
slower again like this engine is just
slower again like this engine is just
not
good either that or they're using it

wrong so
it's like good in theory if you have

and all that s
H get get out of here we don't need
this
this
there
there okay and then if I do
this back to 250
200 what does a guy have to do to get
200 what does a guy have to do to get
his old perf back like I don't know what
his old perf back like I don't know what
the
the
heck like every single time
something it what is it 32
right that's
oh that doesn't
matter so
matter so
how what the heck was it
how what the heck was it
man what did they
change network
think I changed a couple other things
maybe I think I did like this
maybe at input
maybe at input
dim for
think I just did like
this how many more viewers are there six
this how many more viewers are there six
we lost internet for a
we lost internet for a
bit freaking Linux drivers I swear
yeah after it

crashed stupid I got to fix the drivers
crashed stupid I got to fix the drivers
I don't know what's wrong with
I don't know what's wrong with
it
yeah I don't care I'm doing work I'm
yeah I don't care I'm doing work I'm
trying to make progress on this
thing it's really freaking
obnoxious it's like every time I like I
obnoxious it's like every time I like I
turn like every time I look away the
turn like every time I look away the
perace back to what like the original
garbage yeah you
troll this was 250 mil this was

250 I don't know why it's no longer 250
and it drives me insane
and it drives me insane
I work and I perf optimize stuff and it
I work and I perf optimize stuff and it
gets

like you can't really do anything with
like you can't really do anything with
50k it's too
slow I mean that's like a billion an
slow I mean that's like a billion an
hour to a billion 10
hour to a billion 10
hours well you were running I was
hours well you were running I was
running the example scene just different
running the example scene just different
data files that they gave me for testing
data files that they gave me for testing
but it seems like their actual data
but it seems like their actual data
files are substantially
slower I mean unless I'm do I don't
slower I mean unless I'm do I don't
think I'm doing anything stupid here
well I mean I could rewrite this an and
well I mean I could rewrite this an and
it would be a million steps a
it would be a million steps a
second I I'm not doing it now obviously
second I I'm not doing it now obviously
but we can look at it it's
but we can look at it it's
like I don't think it's that
like I don't think it's that
crazy like we could do the render very
crazy like we could do the render very
easily I think that the main thing
easily I think that the main thing
it's so there's a 700 some modline Sim
it's just using all this weird entity
it's just using all this weird entity
component
Shenanigans I mean this is just
like there's like basic collision and
like there's like basic collision and
stuff but
we could do this with or probably even
we could do this with or probably even
without box
2D maybe
with madron we don't need
with madron we don't need
this that's
this that's
nothing 500 lines of oh these are just
nothing 500 lines of oh these are just
structs
most of which are
redundant
redundant
OB
OB
tiny okay this has some
tiny okay this has some
code yeah but this is
rendering
manager this is
rendering seems
right and then there's CPU stuff I
right and then there's CPU stuff I
wouldn't worry about
wouldn't worry about
this level gen not that
this level gen not that
bad they got a Cann in
bad they got a Cann in
here in
it I mean there's like
it I mean there's like
maybe 2,000 lines of like real code in
maybe 2,000 lines of like real code in
here or
less map
less map
R yeah it's not that
bad it would probably need either box 2D
bad it would probably need either box 2D
or we'd have to do our Min version of
it
for

H chatting with e jene
I
mean I wonder if anybody in the Discord
mean I wonder if anybody in the Discord
would actually like to help with
would actually like to help with
this I could definitely get it set up in
started it's like I'm tempted to do this
started it's like I'm tempted to do this
one myself but this one would take I
one myself but this one would take I
mean it would take a bit of
work render probably wouldn't be that
work render probably wouldn't be that
bad could probably make it substantially
bad could probably make it substantially
better as well
this does
work
work
well no we could definitely get at a
well no we could definitely get at a
million we can definitely get this a
million we can definitely get this a
million it's not like it's not that
million it's not like it's not that
heavy of an Environ ironment
it's just a pain because it's like it's
it's just a pain because it's like it's
hard to get people from Academia to
hard to get people from Academia to
actually help on this type of stuff cuz
actually help on this type of stuff cuz
there're always like papers papers
there're always like papers papers
papers and it's
papers and it's
like you can't you got to invest in your
like you can't you got to invest in your
infra or it's just going to be too slow
infra or it's just going to be too slow
for you to do anything and you're just
for you to do anything and you're just
going to be sad and that's just how it's
going to be sad and that's just how it's
going to be
I
I
mean I'm trying to think what I can even
mean I'm trying to think what I can even
do with
this I can technically run a hyper
this I can technically run a hyper
parameter
parameter
sweep like the with these
sweep like the with these
pams what we got Lambda Gamma entropy
maybe it finds something
right I mean I may as well it's kind of
right I mean I may as well it's kind of
free but it's just like it's pretty
silly no I mean maybe I can find him
silly no I mean maybe I can find him
somewhat better hyper
parameters they like look they literally
parameters they like look they literally
haven't tuned the hyper parameters at
haven't tuned the hyper parameters at
all because of how slow it is you see
all because of how slow it is you see
this zero hyper parameter
this zero hyper parameter
tuning
tuning
zero it's like the most important thing
zero it's like the most important thing
to do in the field and they can't even
to do in the field and they can't even
do it because the thing is too slow
I mean I could tune on the example M's
I mean I could tune on the example M's
and hope that that transfers but you
and hope that that transfers but you
know I doubt
it yeah the thing that actually fix the
it yeah the thing that actually fix the
problem here would
be May maybe I could do it if I were
be May maybe I could do it if I were
like on point I could maybe do it in a
like on point I could maybe do it in a
couple
weeks it's a fair bit of work to put in
weeks it's a fair bit of work to put in
for a for a
collab and the thing is people are so
collab and the thing is people are so
freaking dumb that they'll like they'll
freaking dumb that they'll like they'll
count um High per against you like even
count um High per against you like even
so GPU drive at the very least they
so GPU drive at the very least they
released it training at like 30,000 30
released it training at like 30,000 30
something thousand steps per second I
something thousand steps per second I
got a DM I got people like telling me
got a DM I got people like telling me
that like it's too simple because it was
that like it's too simple because it was
90% solved on day one whereas this other
90% solved on day one whereas this other
SIM has been out for years and isn't
SIM has been out for years and isn't
solved and the other SIM runs 10 steps
solved and the other SIM runs 10 steps
per second so it's fundamentally
per second so it's fundamentally
impossible you
know yeah
I mean I wonder how much time it would
I mean I wonder how much time it would
take to get the basics in place you
know I really don't like the Box 2D
know I really don't like the Box 2D
dependency as the problem I really don't
dependency as the problem I really don't
like the freaking physics Sim dependency
like the freaking physics Sim dependency
it's such a pain
honestly
like we should just have our own like
like we should just have our own like
basic set of physics utils it really
basic set of physics utils it really
wouldn't be that
hard we just drop them right in the file
hard we just drop them right in the file
for whatever we just like a b like BAS
for whatever we just like a b like BAS
basic bounding box checks and stuff like
basic bounding box checks and stuff like
that you know just like angled bounding
that you know just like angled bounding
box checks stuff like
box checks stuff like
that couple couple

strs I don't know I kind of want to set
up some other some better hyper prams
up some other some better hyper prams
stuff at the moment I'm trying to think

the stuff I've been building we're
the stuff I've been building we're
already
there we've been there a
while it's not even a difficulty thing
while it's not even a difficulty thing
at this point it's a time thing
it's just that 2,000 3,000 lines of code
it's just that 2,000 3,000 lines of code
is 50 lines a page 40 to 60 pages of
is 50 lines a page 40 to 60 pages of

write more gpus less
write more gpus less
problems I still got to go receip that
problems I still got to go receip that
freaking is it just box five that's
freaking is it just box five that's
acting up that guy or is there other
acting up that guy or is there other
ones obviously four is
dead currently okay I'll go see if I can
dead currently okay I'll go see if I can
reat it I really hope that the GPU isn't
reat it I really hope that the GPU isn't
like somehow
screwed do you have a PR
can we get captain to try it on his M to
can we get captain to try it on his M to
see if it speeds stuff
up pretty
exhausted this is
uh it's been a fair bit of
uh it's been a fair bit of
work I can't even like submit this as
work I can't even like submit this as
the thing it's like yeah their current
the thing it's like yeah their current
Network architecture is better and stuff
Network architecture is better and stuff
cuz they're hard bottlenecked on the end
anyways I stripped like all the
anyways I stripped like all the
overhead what's the

problem I optimize this to a quar
problem I optimize this to a quar
million steps per second up from
million steps per second up from
35k on uh the example tasks but as soon
35k on uh the example tasks but as soon
as you load the train tasks it drops
as you load the train tasks it drops
right back down to
right back down to
50K it's just the engine is not
50K it's just the engine is not
good they have this very F fancy GPU
good they have this very F fancy GPU
engine that's great for what it's good
engine that's great for what it's good
at but this ain't it like they have
at but this ain't it like they have
because they have variable numbers of
because they have variable numbers of
agents and such it's just not good for
that I mean that's what they gave me
but I mean I was assured that it was
but I mean I was assured that it was
going to be
fast I mean unless there's some setting
fast I mean unless there's some setting
I'm missing but I don't think there
is I mean I was I shed repeatedly that
is I mean I was I shed repeatedly that
this thing
this thing
had I mean it it is in the optimal case
had I mean it it is in the optimal case
it's um I think for any like one scam
it's um I think for any like one scam
size you can probably get it to that
performance but like I think it will
performance but like I think it will
literally be the same amount of code as
literally be the same amount of code as
it is now if we just do it and
see just the N it's the fact that they
see just the N it's the fact that they
have to load everything into fix size
have to load everything into fix size
buffers and uh the train set the train
buffers and uh the train set the train
set is less agent D is lower agent

density than the example set
density than the example set
something like
that that it could technically
that that it could technically
be the environment resets or I don't
be the environment resets or I don't
freaking know I'm tired
um
um
yeah I mean I did my part I optimized it
yeah I mean I did my part I optimized it
as much as it could be
as much as it could be
optimized it's it's up a little bit of
optimized it's it's up a little bit of
performance from
before I cut as much overhead as I could
before I cut as much overhead as I could
it scales now so if the Sim as fast
it scales now so if the Sim as fast
it'll go
it'll go
bur somewhat disappointing
though all I got time to do at the
though all I got time to do at the
moment is potentially queue up some um
queue up some experiments figure out
queue up some experiments figure out
maybe I can figure out a couple things
maybe I can figure out a couple things
on uh on carbs and go to
on uh on carbs and go to
bed I came up with another good test for
bed I came up with another good test for
it and some more potential modifications
it and some more potential modifications
but I think even the current version
but I think even the current version
will be
good is it hard to make up
good is it hard to make up
ends yeah they're loaded from Real uh
ends yeah they're loaded from Real uh
real traffic scenarios
so that's a data set like each of these
so that's a data set like each of these
is a real
scenario I don't
scenario I don't
know I'm going to go back to my puffer
know I'm going to go back to my puffer
container
okay let's see how our current
okay let's see how our current
experiments are
experiments are
going we found a few limitations with
going we found a few limitations with
the neoc carbs it's still better than
the neoc carbs it's still better than
the old thing by a huge amount but it's
the old thing by a huge amount but it's
not the god algorithm
not the god algorithm
yet it's going to take a little more
yet it's going to take a little more
work to be the god algorithm
yeah so this is an issue it's cost it
yeah so this is an issue it's cost it
might be pushing cost down here a little
might be pushing cost down here a little
bit we'll
bit we'll
see let
say uh
say uh
it's not filling in the parito front the
it's not filling in the parito front the
way I would like it
way I would like it
to it's only got 60 runs so maybe by the
to it's only got 60 runs so maybe by the
end we'll
end we'll
see I don't
know like to get this running on more
know like to get this running on more
things what was
things what was
um hang
um hang
on yeah I ran this one
on yeah I ran this one
here and hung on this
triple
Triad and a ban
actually can I see is there anything
actually can I see is there anything
suspicious about this triple Triad
suspicious about this triple Triad
curve I should check that
first
score how's the
score how's the
oh
oh
cost that high
oh it's just got one
point is there an infinite in um triple
point is there an infinite in um triple
Triad
Triad
this one looks
great oh there is an infinite isn't
great oh there is an infinite isn't
there hang
on damn
it anything with a noop is has an
it anything with a noop is has an
infinite
unfortunately if the game doesn't punish
unfortunately if the game doesn't punish
you for
it let's go look at
this select
card yeah you can spam select you can
card yeah you can spam select you can
spam uh you can spam select and you can
spam uh you can spam select and you can
spam no op
spam no op
okay
um we're going to have to change some
um we're going to have to change some
stuff I
think do you remove well there's no
think do you remove well there's no
reason to have a no
reason to have a no
Al literally there's no
reason e
so this reward is not enough
we could just cap the episode length
so we'll just
so we'll just
do if and
infinitees for
okay so we do
this
e
e
e e
yeah this is good
okay so we're going to try this
May it's not
used oh this is action
what going on
here e
the Leng KN get reset or something
and
clear add
vog
vog
set yeah this is gets reset
not really I'm just tired it's just
not really I'm just tired it's just
taking a while
oh I'm in that skill
issue that's just skill
isue so we get
isue so we get
[Music]
[Music]
action = to
-1 action
-1 action
equal
actions
this 4 13 5 3
doing all sorts of
stuff you have render
stuff you have render
render should have
um
tick going to go see you
tick going to go see you
later dude I got to go all the way the
later dude I got to go all the way the
[ __ ] down to the that's happening
[ __ ] down to the that's happening
tomorrow
I'm finishing this and going to
sleep okay um
oh I
oh I
see this goes here
this get stuck instantly it's
this get stuck instantly it's
weird it's probably in the mend
weird it's probably in the mend
code whatever I did to that
reset the
game for
I don't understand what's wrong with
this I don't know how I could have
this I don't know how I could have
possibly broken it
good I'm just going to go GDB this I
good I'm just going to go GDB this I
don't
know for
and screws up the
renderer e
oh okay so this is why the the model
oh okay so this is why the the model
needs to be retrained obviously cuz it's
needs to be retrained obviously cuz it's
going to try to place the
card forever we just going to try to
card forever we just going to try to
place this card
so it's probably just the human actions
so it's probably just the human actions
that are screwed up
and
interesting okay
okay it's not passing actions to the
okay it's not passing actions to the
freaking I I know what it is it's just
freaking I I know what it is it's just
not passing actions
too yeah I just screwed this
up so we just do
n it's just it's literally just this
okay and now if I do like
this
interesting I appear at the
interesting I appear at the
permissioning [ __ ] with my
Docker I just press three and it
Docker I just press three and it
selected card
two okay
selected minus one
got place
got place
card action minus
five I actually don't know how that
works for
how is this
working do this
okay and then minus
okay and then minus
5 hang
on there minus one
what the heck
oh
my4 still no
seriously
there's the Heap overflow
why is there no symbolizer
what the what's the damn package
literally L duh
literally L duh
that was
symbolizer
symbolizer
fine here's the
end and we get the
end and we get the
trace which
is six
card selected of player index
is there a minus five
somewhere e
you know is it this wait card placement
you know is it this wait card placement
minus
one it's got to be this
right no that's doesn't
right no that's doesn't
help that screws it up
instantly e
what in the
hell I mean this is
insane literally how is it this much of
insane literally how is it this much of
a
a
mess dude like how
maybe I do
maybe I do
this and then
four how about
this buffer are you kidding me
how oh wait hold on
did
action one
and it'll
set
set
right it's stuck cuz this is an old
right it's stuck cuz this is an old
model and it's mapping
actions y so there it go reset
we'll see if this fixes
we'll see if this fixes
it and then I can go to
it and then I can go to
bed having
bed having
accomplished a great many things
see if this instantly say
faults then we'll call
faults then we'll call
tonight soon as we get these experiments
tonight soon as we get these experiments
up been
running let's see if this egg
running let's see if this egg
faults some
[ __ ] oh
[ __ ] oh
ho so hopefully this makes it impossible
ho so hopefully this makes it impossible
to infinite
to infinite
loop I would
hope that's what was happening
hope that's what was happening
previously I
believe and was just infinite
believe and was just infinite
looping wasn't getting any logs
back there go wasn't logging
anything we'll
see like this for instance did bad to
see like this for instance did bad to
the pipers
it's just
stuck now we'll hope that this is not
stuck now we'll hope that this is not
you know all of them
do I do something that would break this
do I do something that would break this
or is this just a Bas of
or is this just a Bas of
hypers guess we'll find out in a second
hypers guess we'll find out in a second
but I do want to take a quick look to
but I do want to take a quick look to
make
sure game over gets set to one
episode return goes to negative
one so it must just be running out of
one so it must just be running out of
time here spamming uh spamming Act or
time here spamming uh spamming Act or
something it can spam
something it can spam
select but it should be getting a
select but it should be getting a
negative reward for
negative reward for
that hang on what could it actually be
doing think we'll wait for the next
doing think we'll wait for the next
experiment but if the next one is also
experiment but if the next one is also
like this then
yeah it gets punished for selecting bad
yeah it gets punished for selecting bad
actions
it shouldn't be able to have um a return
it shouldn't be able to have um a return
of negative one like this
one good thing I caught this
anyways now this is
anyways now this is
broken for
okay so episode return
let's see what it's doing
wa
okay
for resetting instantly without doing
for resetting instantly without doing
anything
oh I know what it
is it's funny that it figures that
out that it doesn't get Negative reward
out that it doesn't get Negative reward
if it
if it
spams that's really clever
spams that's really clever
actually freaking RL just
now you can't do it anymore can you
now you can't do it anymore can you
haha have defeated
you you semi
you you semi
sentient reinforcement learning
algorithm and now you shall run many
algorithm and now you shall run many
experiments for me
without
halting she'll run very very many
halting she'll run very very many
experiments without halting
and actually I can go set
and actually I can go set
the this can be
30 you only you only really need 10
30 you only you only really need 10
actions you be
actions you be
20 we'll leave it at 30
it just changed this Why didn't it uh
the
the
heck now whatever it'll be the
same rebuild this
same rebuild this
one there it
one there it
goes oh it is
rebuilding this one

done I just gave you my API token stupid
done I just gave you my API token stupid
thing give me AP I
thing give me AP I
took
have one my expense
episode return locked to
3.9 I mean what are the odds that that's
3.9 I mean what are the odds that that's
literally uh I just saw the actual
literally uh I just saw the actual
training work okay
training work okay
that could
that could
be what you get for spamming bad
actions that would say that there's no
actions that would say that there's no
the seating is working which would be
the seating is working which would be
interesting
I'm going to watch it for a few
I'm going to watch it for a few
minutes see if it's
working I'm going to say that this is
working I'm going to say that this is
still possibly just very bad hypers
let's see if this gets stuck at 39
it does but after a bit of
it does but after a bit of
uh uh it's not like locked to
uh uh it's not like locked to
it it could just be that like too high
it it could just be that like too high
learning rate or too high whatever
learning rate or too high whatever
is you know
I want to at least see a decent set of
hypers that's too ambitious it's already
hypers that's too ambitious it's already

a quick

okay e
it's

good
okay you know we're learning stuff here
okay you know we're learning stuff here
it's just uh there's some bad hypers in
it's just uh there's some bad hypers in
this environment that you can't get
this environment that you can't get
around apparently they just craft right
around apparently they just craft right
out that's fine
we are
we are
good
good
oops it's
late there we go
I will let this one run
overnight
overnight
um do I cue something else
um do I cue something else
up I guess I may as well
I don't think there's a num
Ms oh no there is num
M it's four
so it'll be 1 through eight I
so it'll be 1 through eight I
guess for this
this should be
like
like
eight 1 through eight 2 through
eight 1 through eight 2 through
eight 1 through
eight 1 through
eight I think one is still
eight I think one is still
fine yeah cuz it's Vector as two are
fine yeah cuz it's Vector as two are
good so we have the
good so we have the
rewards we got
58 um
58 um
and then
and then
maximize it's
maximize it's
Min com
Min com
c so I'll have to add a panel for this
c so I'll have to add a panel for this
but otherwise this should
but otherwise this should
be it should be
fine let's see if this this
runs oh wait I have something running
runs oh wait I have something running
already we're good to go for the evening
already we're good to go for the evening
I'll let that one finish before I do
I'll let that one finish before I do
