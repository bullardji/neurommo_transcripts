We're going to try
Yes. I should have it autogen tags.
Okay. So, we have this going. Let's now

go back to uh the meta

Where are our results?
I guess we have to redo our dashboard

our stuff is free and open source, but

industry or know some folks who do and
they're having a hard time of it, we
they're having a hard time of it, we
make RL much much faster and much much
easier. like this set of experiments in

that you could run anything remotely

pretty much unthinkable like even a few

ago. Very strong results, you know. And

because these are very strong
because these are very strong

have issues with neural MMO 3. I bet you
have issues with neural MMO 3. I bet you
there are some data issues with
there are some data issues with
uh with neural MMO 3. We should go look
uh with neural MMO 3. We should go look
for those at some
point. But I think in the
meantime, I think we come up with a plan
meantime, I think we come up with a plan
for the rest of the day. I've got half
for the rest of the day. I've got half
an hour now.
to work on a few things and then
to work on a few things and then
breakfast and then I will be free for
breakfast and then I will be free for
the rest of the day except for uh
the rest of the day except for uh
whenever the new equipment gets here. I
whenever the new equipment gets here. I
got to take delivery of that which I'll
got to take delivery of that which I'll
probably just leave the stream on and
probably just leave the stream on and
have that in the background. We'll see
have that in the background. We'll see
because it'll be
fun. Depends how long it takes.
Let's take a look at our
latest release.
Oh, and actually let me send these uh
Oh, and actually let me send these uh
these params over to Aaron so that he
can because he should be able to do some
work on
work on
this just so he can take it from here.
Good. So Aaron will do that. Does Puffer
Good. So Aaron will do that. Does Puffer

don't tend to use a ton of continuous

because RMS are way faster. Uh but it is
because RMS are way faster. Uh but it is
very easy to bind any existing thing to
very easy to bind any existing thing to
puffer lib and uh you know we can help
puffer lib and uh you know we can help
with that on the open source side for
with that on the open source side for
free or if you want a little bit more
free or if you want a little bit more
insight and you do stuff in a company
insight and you do stuff in a company
context then we can do that under
context then we can do that under
contract.
Like I say, all our stuff is free and
Like I say, all our stuff is free and
open source, so you're free to just use
open source, so you're free to just use
it. The contracts are just if you want,
it. The contracts are just if you want,
you know, if you want the types of
you know, if you want the types of
results you see here that we get for all
results you see here that we get for all
these other
ends, but we've kind of done enough
ends, but we've kind of done enough
fundamental stuff for a a little bit
fundamental stuff for a a little bit
here. I think that I really want this
here. I think that I really want this
file to be which is our like our main
file to be which is our like our main
train file. I want this to be virtually
train file. I want this to be virtually
ready to go
today. Let me think how much other stuff
today. Let me think how much other stuff
there will be like what is on the the
there will be like what is on the the
total to-do list still before release.
like the meta results actually make me
like the meta results actually make me
way more confident in uh in releasing
way more confident in uh in releasing
this stuff like the quality of what the
this stuff like the quality of what the
results
results
are. But there's still like some
are. But there's still like some
usability things I want to have fixed.
just
like so this is all that we have in
like so this is all that we have in
puffer
lib. I don't think we need to mess with
lib. I don't think we need to mess with
the emulation file very much this
the emulation file very much this
release.
models are pretty fine. There are a few
models are pretty fine. There are a few
very small
tweaks. Puffer lip/puffer lip just has
tweaks. Puffer lip/puffer lip just has
utils. There are a few things to clean
utils. There are a few things to clean
up in PyTorch.
you know, we really don't have that much
you know, we really don't have that much
left to refactor um outside of the main

initialize num agents. Yeah, there are a
initialize num agents. Yeah, there are a
few like quality of life things I think
few like quality of life things I think
mainly in the new
envi but those are all like pretty quick
envi but those are all like pretty quick
and straightforward.
So really
like final
like final
checklist. So we have
like welcome YouTube folks.
good number of people have here on uh
good number of people have here on uh
9:30 on a Thursday or I guess it's
9:30 on a Thursday or I guess it's

Friday.
Whoops. Um my hope for today is that
Whoops. Um my hope for today is that
we we get like all the small stuff to a
we we get like all the small stuff to a
good spot because tomorrow is
good spot because tomorrow is
my longer work
my longer work
day. And
um ideally tomorrow we can start running
um ideally tomorrow we can start running
all of the like experiments on all the
all of the like experiments on all the
different M's and B baselines and really
different M's and B baselines and really
start locking down stuff for the
start locking down stuff for the
release. So I guess the big things on
release. So I guess the big things on
the checklist risk it's final clean up.
the checklist risk it's final clean up.
So it's like major is the

Um, we need working
Um, we need working
baselines on puffer

suggestions for what we should really
suggestions for what we should really
include in our benchmarks here guys if
include in our benchmarks here guys if
anybody wants like a specific env
anybody wants like a specific env
included if we already have it and it's
included if we already have it and it's
fast I can just run it. Um, if we don't
fast I can just run it. Um, if we don't
already have a binding port and you want
already have a binding port and you want
to help us add one real quick and then
to help us add one real quick and then
run we can run stuff on it, that's also
cool. So, uh, if you're still here and
cool. So, uh, if you're still here and
you want to add like we already have
you want to add like we already have
Majokco binds and like I think we have
Majokco binds and like I think we have
an old DMC thing. So, if you want to
an old DMC thing. So, if you want to
help us get some stuff running on that,
help us get some stuff running on that,
we can even get those into the next
we can even get those into the next
release here.

it. Now, if you're doing RL anyways, I'd
suggest checking out our trainer because
suggest checking out our trainer because
it's really fast and it works really

some of our own algorithmic

going very well. So, here's to next

Thank you very much for that. I think
Thank you very much for that. I think
you were because it was uh it was 1999

We need to get some baselines on all our

anything else we need to do for release
because I I've got like another 10-ish
because I I've got like another 10-ish
minutes now and I just I want to have
minutes now and I just I want to have
the full picture because I basically
the full picture because I basically
what I want to do is I want to set
what I want to do is I want to set
myself up so for the whole rest of today
myself up so for the whole rest of today
and then tomorrow I don't have to like
and then tomorrow I don't have to like
keep going back to this. I want to just
keep going back to this. I want to just
be able to go right. I want to just be

docs.
Updated. Is that everything?
This is the biggest one
here. And packaging. These are the two
here. And packaging. These are the two
hardest ones is like getting the code in
hardest ones is like getting the code in
a state I'm happy with cuz I'm
a state I'm happy with cuz I'm
picky. And then
packaging. I'm pretty confident we can
packaging. I'm pretty confident we can
get good baselines on
everything. This we basically already
everything. This we basically already
did. These are easy
did. These are easy
experiments. This is just like busy
experiments. This is just like busy
work.
I guess I do have to make sure rest of
I guess I do have to make sure rest of
M's are
ported. I guess.
Okay. So if I do this then what's the
Okay. So if I do this then what's the
release going to look like? Oh yeah the
release going to look like? Oh yeah the
blog
obviously. So this is going to be
obviously. So this is going to be
protein which is our new hyperp sweep
protein which is our new hyperp sweep
algorithm.

This is going to
This is going to
cover
um puffer advantage plus
filtering which is like our algo side
stuff.
stuff.
Oh yeah. I was wondering why that got so
Oh yeah. I was wondering why that got so
loud in the background.
loud in the background.
Turns out that rain on a metal warehouse
Turns out that rain on a metal warehouse
roof is uh pretty
loud. Hopefully the uh noise filter
loud. Hopefully the uh noise filter
catches most of
it. Protein puffer advantage
it. Protein puffer advantage

CAPI. What other stuff should I put in
CAPI. What other stuff should I put in
um the release that would be hype? The
um the release that would be hype? The
new M's obviously.
Maybe like a
speedun, something like that.
I mean, the really the big thing about
I mean, the really the big thing about
this
release. Yeah, those are all the topics
release. Yeah, those are all the topics
I want to cover, I think, in there.
That's
That's
good. I think this is this is about
good. I think this is this is about
enough for
enough for
release if we do all
this. So, let me uh let me just bullet
this. So, let me uh let me just bullet
this out so I know what I'm doing today.
this out so I know what I'm doing today.
And then I'm going for breakfast in a
And then I'm going for breakfast in a
few and then I'll be back and I'm going
few and then I'll be back and I'm going
to start with this whole cleanup, I
to start with this whole cleanup, I
think. So this is going to be like

continuous. Well, I don't know if you
continuous. Well, I don't know if you
actually want to have
continuous. Maybe, maybe we'll do
that. And that should be everything.
Okay, Araga, we we don't currently do uh
Okay, Araga, we we don't currently do uh
internships. This is all like open
internships. This is all like open
source stuff. We do a small amount of uh
source stuff. We do a small amount of uh
paid work for clients in RL, but then
paid work for clients in RL, but then
the people I put on those are either uh
the people I put on those are either uh
PhD students I've worked with
PhD students I've worked with
previously and I know I work well with
previously and I know I work well with
or top contributors uh to Puffer Lib who
or top contributors uh to Puffer Lib who
I know can get the work done. We don't
I know can get the work done. We don't
do like random random like uh you know
do like random random like uh you know
fixed time position hires intern or
fixed time position hires intern or
full-time
either. And that's just mainly because
either. And that's just mainly because
of the way the uh the company is uh is
of the way the uh the company is uh is
run. Like the income for the company is
run. Like the income for the company is
from clients. We don't have funding or
from clients. We don't have funding or
other stuff. So, it's like we hire
other stuff. So, it's like we hire
people to do things for clients, not
people to do things for clients, not
like general pull-time for a puffer.
Was there anything else I wanted to do?
Was there anything else I wanted to do?
Oh yeah, you also I wanted to check
um whether you need multiple data
um whether you need multiple data
points, right?
Well, I can put that in here. Do
Well, I can put that in here. Do
you need multiple
you need multiple
sweets per

run? All right, that should be
everything
everything
here. Hey, Spencer. Yeah, let me take a
here. Hey, Spencer. Yeah, let me take a
quick look at your sweep, though. I'm
quick look at your sweep, though. I'm
going to have to go any second for
going to have to go any second for
breakfast. You know, thanks for your
breakfast. You know, thanks for your
interest to Argy here. It's just the way
interest to Argy here. It's just the way
that Puffer works. We're very heavily
that Puffer works. We're very heavily
trying to bootstrap this. So, we can't
trying to bootstrap this. So, we can't
just like randomly be hiring uh interns
just like randomly be hiring uh interns
when there's not like income coming from
when there's not like income coming from
those interns or clients
specifically. So, I don't like to
specifically. So, I don't like to
advertise to people like, "Hey, if you
advertise to people like, "Hey, if you
come do a bunch of free work, maybe
come do a bunch of free work, maybe
there's a position for you." Because
there's a position for you." Because
that's kind of jank. Um it's more so
that's kind of jank. Um it's more so
just like people contribute who want to
just like people contribute who want to
learn and contribute and then you know
learn and contribute and then you know
if people get good enough we pull the
if people get good enough we pull the
like we can pull people from community
like we can pull people from community
into gigs when they make sense but there
into gigs when they make sense but there
are no guarantees on
that. Let's see. Let's see your sweep,
Spencer. Please link
sweep. And actually, I just I'll say for
sweep. And actually, I just I'll say for
the people watching because I got to go
the people watching because I got to go
in a second. I will be back after
in a second. I will be back after
breakfast for the whole rest of the day.

with open source dev, just join the
with open source dev, just join the
Discord. You don't need an RL
Discord. You don't need an RL

me on X for more RL content.
Okay, here's the sweep. Spencer, just
Okay, here's the sweep. Spencer, just

you're muted, but how's it going,
you're muted, but how's it going,

And I think the reason why the score is
And I think the reason why the score is
coming down low on that is due to the
coming down low on that is due to the
respawn stuff. Okay. So, I mean it's
respawn stuff. Okay. So, I mean it's
good now we're just down to like a
good now we're just down to like a
little bit of MJ jank on this for the
little bit of MJ jank on this for the
most part. And

um yeah, I think you'll have this and
um yeah, I think you'll have this and
the new M to play around with. Um and we
the new M to play around with. Um and we
can just go back and forth on stuff for
can just go back and forth on stuff for

these. We will have to figure out the
speed at some point, but I think we can
speed at some point, but I think we can
do that after.
do that after.
Um, it's probably just going to be a
Um, it's probably just going to be a
matter of cutting out redundant obs.
matter of cutting out redundant obs.
Yeah, I think that's probably going to
Yeah, I think that's probably going to
be most of it. So, I was thinking what
be most of it. So, I was thinking what
I'll do is I was going
I'll do is I was going
to change how this the collisions are
to change how this the collisions are
recognized. Mhm. Um, such that
recognized. Mhm. Um, such that
collisions are only
collisions are only
recognized
recognized
if it is prior to you reaching your
if it is prior to you reaching your
first goal. And like if you run into a
first goal. And like if you run into a
car that has already reached its goal on
car that has already reached its goal on
their second life, then it doesn't count
their second life, then it doesn't count
as a collision.
as a collision.
Are you still going to get negative
Are you still going to get negative
reward though?
reward though?
Well, that's the part I was going to
Well, that's the part I was going to
take out. Well, you they need to still
take out. Well, you they need to still
get a negative reward for colliding if
get a negative reward for colliding if
you want them to not learn to just go
you want them to not learn to just go
through each
through each
other cuz if they're only re if they
other cuz if they're only re if they
only get a penalty for colliding on the
only get a penalty for colliding on the
first time, then like it's questionable
first time, then like it's questionable
whether they actually learn to stop
whether they actually learn to stop
colliding. Like they could actually
colliding. Like they could actually
learn after I after I get the goal once
learn after I after I get the goal once
or whatever, I can collide as much as I
or whatever, I can collide as much as I
want.
want.
What if I add an observation that is
What if I add an observation that is
like have has that agent reached its
like have has that agent reached its
goal and you can see it
goal and you can see it
because arguably you should be able to
because arguably you should be able to
phase through another car in the second
phase through another car in the second
life.
I mean the main thing you're learning
I mean the main thing you're learning
like not colliding with stationary walls
like not colliding with stationary walls
should be learnable very easily. The
should be learnable very easily. The
main thing you are learning is avoiding
main thing you are learning is avoiding
collision. I we need to think of a good
collision. I we need to think of a good
way to handle
way to handle
this. That's
like I wonder if the spawn immunity just
like I wonder if the spawn immunity just
covers
it. Right.
it. Right.
Well, that's what I was offering was
Well, that's what I was offering was
just like collisions don't count if but
just like collisions don't count if but
it would be like it doesn't count for a
it would be like it doesn't count for a
few like I mean you could do it for like
few like I mean you could do it for like
10 time steps or whatever or like it
10 time steps or whatever or like it
would have to be for like some fixed
would have to be for like some fixed
number of time steps. So we'd have to
number of time steps. So we'd have to
like look like how long roughly these
like look like how long roughly these
time steps are cuz the idea is like if a
time steps are cuz the idea is like if a
car spawns right in front of you and
car spawns right in front of you and
you're already going that direction, you
you're already going that direction, you
should be able to go through it.
Correct.
Correct.
Um, off-road rate is pretty much solved
Um, off-road rate is pretty much solved
at this point. It's 6%.
at this point. It's 6%.
Okay, good. So, it's entirely collision
Okay, good. So, it's entirely collision
rate because completion rate is getting
rate because completion rate is getting
up to 95% now. And then car collision
up to 95% now. And then car collision
still like 20% of which I probably a
still like 20% of which I probably a
bunch of it is. Yeah, it's just it's
bunch of it is. Yeah, it's just it's
just the respawn things. Okay, cool. And
just the respawn things. Okay, cool. And
then so yeah, I mean some degree of
then so yeah, I mean some degree of
spawn immunity. And then second thing to
spawn immunity. And then second thing to
look at is
uh what was I going to say? Oh,
uh what was I going to say? Oh,
confirming from the actual original GPU
confirming from the actual original GPU
drive environment that their cars the
drive environment that their cars the
cars that they're spawning are the same
cars that they're spawning are the same
cars that I'm spawning in the agents
cars that I'm spawning in the agents
that I'm are considering to be agents
that I'm are considering to be agents
because I can't do that really on my
because I can't do that really on my
computer.
Yeah. No, we will we'll make sure of
Yeah. No, we will we'll make sure of
that. Don't worry. I'll like I'll have
that. Don't worry. I'll like I'll have
to set it up locally, but I'll do that.
Okay. But so for now, do you think just
Okay. But so for now, do you think just
doing spawn try spawn immunity and see
doing spawn try spawn immunity and see
how it goes? Um yeah, do like a few
how it goes? Um yeah, do like a few
frame spawn immunity and uh see how that
frame spawn immunity and uh see how that
goes and rerun sweep. See if we get like
goes and rerun sweep. See if we get like
close to one. By the way, this sweep was
close to one. By the way, this sweep was
with a kneeling on and then solved in
with a kneeling on and then solved in
like 70 million. Do you want me to go a
like 70 million. Do you want me to go a
non- annealing sweep?
non- annealing sweep?
Uh if you're solving, it doesn't matter.
Uh if you're solving, it doesn't matter.
The kneeling only matters if um a
The kneeling only matters if um a
kneeling off only matters for stuff like
kneeling off only matters for stuff like

Okay. All right. Sounds good. Cool.

Okay. Uh the plan for me for the today
Okay. Uh the plan for me for the today
is going to be to like clean up pretty
is going to be to like clean up pretty
much the whole rest of Puffer. We got

some amazing results overnight on meta.

We have this one right here. Actually,
We have this one right here. Actually,

bit better now,
huh? Try
that. Then that one actually can get us
that. Then that one actually can get us
like a reasonableish number of
like a reasonableish number of

We're just going to delete
this 2.5 billion steps.
Oh, you know
Oh, you know
what? I don't think we did the mini

384 is what we've been using.
We're going to try
Yes. I should have it autogen tags.
Okay. So, we have this going. Let's now
Okay. So, we have this going. Let's now
go back to uh the meta
go back to uh the meta
experiments right here.
Where are our results?
I guess we have to redo our dashboard
I guess we have to redo our dashboard
for
for
this mildly annoying
Pepper. It should be good now.
Right. Good. And we will be back to your
Right. Good. And we will be back to your
daily scheduled experimental

going to do
this, we're just going to grab like some

But for some reason like

It's a very

There we

with this indeed.
Cool. They should be very very happy

Um, yeah, they should be very very happy
Um, yeah, they should be very very happy

good. Good time to mention that all of
good. Good time to mention that all of
our stuff is free and open source, but
our stuff is free and open source, but
uh we do stuff like this paid for uh
uh we do stuff like this paid for uh
people in industry. So, if you do RL in
people in industry. So, if you do RL in
industry or know some folks who do and
industry or know some folks who do and
they're having a hard time of it, we
they're having a hard time of it, we
make RL much much faster and much much
easier. like this set of experiments in
easier. like this set of experiments in
particular. Uh this is not something
particular. Uh this is not something
that you could run anything remotely
that you could run anything remotely
close to in any other library or system
close to in any other library or system
or whatever. This is directly from our
or whatever. This is directly from our
latest release and these results are
latest release and these results are
pretty much unthinkable like even a few
pretty much unthinkable like even a few
months
months
ago. Very strong results, you know. And
ago. Very strong results, you know. And
because these are very strong
because these are very strong
results, I'm starting to wonder if we
results, I'm starting to wonder if we
have issues with neural MMO 3. I bet you
have issues with neural MMO 3. I bet you
there are some data issues with
there are some data issues with
uh with neural MMO 3. We should go look
uh with neural MMO 3. We should go look
for those at some
point. But I think in the
meantime, I think we come up with a plan
meantime, I think we come up with a plan
for the rest of the day. I've got half
for the rest of the day. I've got half
an hour now.
to work on a few things and then
to work on a few things and then
breakfast and then I will be free for
breakfast and then I will be free for
the rest of the day except for uh
the rest of the day except for uh
whenever the new equipment gets here. I
whenever the new equipment gets here. I
got to take delivery of that which I'll
got to take delivery of that which I'll
probably just leave the stream on and
probably just leave the stream on and
have that in the background. We'll see
have that in the background. We'll see
because it'll be
fun. Depends how long it takes.
Let's take a look at our
latest release.
Oh, and actually let me send these uh
Oh, and actually let me send these uh
these params over to Aaron so that he
can because he should be able to do some
work on
work on
this just so he can take it from here.
Good. So Aaron will do that. Does Puffer
Good. So Aaron will do that. Does Puffer
Lab support continuous M like Majoko
Lab support continuous M like Majoko
Deep Mind Control Suite or Mayo? Yes, we
Deep Mind Control Suite or Mayo? Yes, we
have continuous control support. We've
have continuous control support. We've
done uh paid robotics worth work for
done uh paid robotics worth work for
clients before, specifically in
clients before, specifically in
animation gen with Isaac Jim. uh we
animation gen with Isaac Jim. uh we
don't tend to use a ton of continuous
don't tend to use a ton of continuous
control stuff in our benchmarking just
control stuff in our benchmarking just
because RMS are way faster. Uh but it is
because RMS are way faster. Uh but it is
very easy to bind any existing thing to
very easy to bind any existing thing to
puffer lib and uh you know we can help
puffer lib and uh you know we can help
with that on the open source side for
with that on the open source side for
free or if you want a little bit more
free or if you want a little bit more
insight and you do stuff in a company
insight and you do stuff in a company
context then we can do that under
context then we can do that under
contract.
Like I say, all our stuff is free and
Like I say, all our stuff is free and
open source, so you're free to just use
open source, so you're free to just use
it. The contracts are just if you want,
it. The contracts are just if you want,
you know, if you want the types of
you know, if you want the types of
results you see here that we get for all
results you see here that we get for all
these other
ends, but we've kind of done enough
ends, but we've kind of done enough
fundamental stuff for a a little bit
fundamental stuff for a a little bit
here. I think that I really want this
here. I think that I really want this
file to be which is our like our main
file to be which is our like our main
train file. I want this to be virtually
train file. I want this to be virtually
ready to go
today. Let me think how much other stuff
today. Let me think how much other stuff
there will be like what is on the the
there will be like what is on the the
total to-do list still before release.
like the meta results actually make me
like the meta results actually make me
way more confident in uh in releasing
way more confident in uh in releasing
this stuff like the quality of what the
this stuff like the quality of what the
results
results
are. But there's still like some
are. But there's still like some
usability things I want to have fixed.
just
like so this is all that we have in
like so this is all that we have in
puffer
lib. I don't think we need to mess with
lib. I don't think we need to mess with
the emulation file very much this
the emulation file very much this
release.
models are pretty fine. There are a few
models are pretty fine. There are a few
very small
tweaks. Puffer lip/puffer lip just has
tweaks. Puffer lip/puffer lip just has
utils. There are a few things to clean
utils. There are a few things to clean
up in PyTorch.
you know, we really don't have that much
you know, we really don't have that much
left to refactor um outside of the main
left to refactor um outside of the main
train
demo clip range for continuous
demo clip range for continuous
policies make it easier to not forget
policies make it easier to not forget
initialize num agents. Yeah, there are a
initialize num agents. Yeah, there are a
few like quality of life things I think
few like quality of life things I think
mainly in the new
envi but those are all like pretty quick
envi but those are all like pretty quick
and straightforward.
So really
like final
like final
checklist. So we have
like welcome YouTube folks.
good number of people have here on uh
good number of people have here on uh
9:30 on a Thursday or I guess it's
9:30 on a Thursday or I guess it's
Friday.
Friday.
Whoops. Um my hope for today is that
Whoops. Um my hope for today is that
we we get like all the small stuff to a
we we get like all the small stuff to a
good spot because tomorrow is
good spot because tomorrow is
my longer work
my longer work
day. And
um ideally tomorrow we can start running
um ideally tomorrow we can start running
all of the like experiments on all the
all of the like experiments on all the
different M's and B baselines and really
different M's and B baselines and really
start locking down stuff for the
start locking down stuff for the
release. So I guess the big things on
release. So I guess the big things on
the checklist risk it's final clean up.
the checklist risk it's final clean up.
So it's like major is the
So it's like major is the
clean
clean
puffer
minor in a rest of
minor in a rest of

Um, we need working
Um, we need working
baselines on puffer
baselines on puffer
ends plus a few
externals probably like
externals probably like
Atari and if you have re if you have
Atari and if you have re if you have
suggestions for what we should really
suggestions for what we should really
include in our benchmarks here guys if
include in our benchmarks here guys if
anybody wants like a specific env
anybody wants like a specific env
included if we already have it and it's
included if we already have it and it's
fast I can just run it. Um, if we don't
fast I can just run it. Um, if we don't
already have a binding port and you want
already have a binding port and you want
to help us add one real quick and then
to help us add one real quick and then
run we can run stuff on it, that's also
cool. So, uh, if you're still here and
cool. So, uh, if you're still here and
you want to add like we already have
you want to add like we already have
Majokco binds and like I think we have
Majokco binds and like I think we have
an old DMC thing. So, if you want to
an old DMC thing. So, if you want to
help us get some stuff running on that,
help us get some stuff running on that,
we can even get those into the next
we can even get those into the next
release here.
Welcome

typically if you use gym vectorzation or

anything, you're not going to get

very, very low overhead as well. And our
very, very low overhead as well. And our
trainer is just better. like we're not

We have our own advantage function. We
We have our own advantage function. We

replay that's still on policy. Um we
have a lot of new things. Plus, we have
have a lot of new things. Plus, we have
the best hyperparam sweep stuff out
the best hyperparam sweep stuff out
there as well. So, typically the
there as well. So, typically the
workflow in Puffer is like get your
workflow in Puffer is like get your
thing set up, tune it a little, make
thing set up, tune it a little, make
sure it's fast, run 100 or 200

thing automatically solved. It's like

actually remarkably remarkably easy to

get stuff working um on new MS like
get stuff working um on new MS like
that. We have had people do stuff with
that. We have had people do stuff with
Majoko that worked pretty well in the
Majoko that worked pretty well in the
past. Um we just haven't like done it
past. Um we just haven't like done it
lately on our main b uh main benchmarks.

But yeah, it would be pretty easy to get
But yeah, it would be pretty easy to get
that stuff set up and working
that stuff set up and working

let me answer both of those questions at

Um, so here's the thing. If you like are

SP3 or RL liber one of those, it's not.
SP3 or RL liber one of those, it's not.
It's way lighter weight. Let me show

It's one like thousandline file. This
It's one like thousandline file. This

of thing where you're going to have to
go dig through a bunch of things. Like
go dig through a bunch of things. Like
if you want to implement your own
if you want to implement your own

it clean RL style in this file. And if
it clean RL style in this file. And if
you use like the way that we have our
you use like the way that we have our
data set up in here, just in this file,
data set up in here, just in this file,
you'll maintain all of our speed
you'll maintain all of our speed
optimizations as well. Plus, this comes
optimizations as well. Plus, this comes
with like profiling to make it really
with like profiling to make it really
easy to optimize, too. Uh if you just
easy to optimize, too. Uh if you just
want a hyperprem
optimization, it's in this

I don't know. The only real dependency
I don't know. The only real dependency
here is pyro. I think the sci-fi stats
here is pyro. I think the sci-fi stats
one's even

outdated. Yeah, this is dated there.
outdated. Yeah, this is dated there.
Only dependency is pyro, uh, which we
Only dependency is pyro, uh, which we
use for Gaussian processes. You can just
use for Gaussian processes. You can just
take this file and use
take this file and use
it. Now, if you're doing RL anyways, I'd
it. Now, if you're doing RL anyways, I'd
suggest checking out our trainer because
suggest checking out our trainer because
it's really fast and it works really
it's really fast and it works really
well with this. Um, but yeah, you can
well with this. Um, but yeah, you can
totally just use this
totally just use this

it's not some massive framework it's
it's not some massive framework it's
just it's really really fast but it's
just it's really really fast but it's
also a couple of
files and we also have I mean I stream

dev constantly so it's easy to get help
dev constantly so it's easy to get help
here and we also have a nice community

Puffer. I'm so happy with that.
Holy. That's been a goal for a while.
And it's just it's really nice to have
And it's just it's really nice to have
that. You know, the thing that just
that. You know, the thing that just
screwed with me my entire
PhD. Let me show you
PhD. Let me show you
something. So, this is my this is what I
something. So, this is my this is what I
worked on my entire
worked on my entire
PhD about 531 stars, right? And this is
PhD about 531 stars, right? And this is
with me like, you know, working my ass
with me like, you know, working my ass
off, running competitions, trying to
off, running competitions, trying to
like do all sorts of stuff to like, you
like do all sorts of stuff to like, you
know, foster RL in the community, like

these competitions as
these competitions as
well, and it like it did
well, and it like it did
okay, but like it never really took off
okay, but like it never really took off
massively. And then the thing that just
massively. And then the thing that just
always screwed with me is that the
always screwed with me is that the
initial release while I was at OpenAI
initial release while I was at OpenAI
just based on the OpenAI publicity got
just based on the OpenAI publicity got
like this just from like the old
like this just from like the old
unmaintained 10

been about one year since I graduated to
been about one year since I graduated to
have 2K on an RL repo which for RL
have 2K on an RL repo which for RL
that's pretty dang big. That's bigger
that's pretty dang big. That's bigger
than a lot of the other libraries that
than a lot of the other libraries that
have been around for longer. Um, and
have been around for longer. Um, and
also to know that we have the fastest
also to know that we have the fastest
code, the simplest code, right? We have
code, the simplest code, right? We have
the best results on a ton of different
the best results on a ton of different
benchmarks. We've got now we're going to
benchmarks. We've got now we're going to
have 15 plus ultra higherf custom
have 15 plus ultra higherf custom
environments for research. We've made
environments for research. We've made
some of our own algorithmic
some of our own algorithmic
improvements. Like this is just this is
improvements. Like this is just this is
going very well. So, here's to next
release. might actually be the 2000.
release. might actually be the 2000.
Thank you very much for that. I think
Thank you very much for that. I think
you were because it was uh it was 1999
you were because it was uh it was 1999
last night. So, thank you very much.
packaging. Anything else that should go
packaging. Anything else that should go
on this
on this
checklist? We got to get the final
checklist? We got to get the final
cleanup
done. Thanks, Pepper.
done. Thanks, Pepper.
We need to get some baselines on all our
We need to get some baselines on all our
M's, plus a really high quality sweeps
M's, plus a really high quality sweeps
on the important
M's. Replied in your
post. Yeah, my DMs are open, man.
So if it's public stuff, Discord,
So if it's public stuff, Discord,
whatever, if you have like business
whatever, if you have like business
inquiries or whatever. Yeah, my DMs are
inquiries or whatever. Yeah, my DMs are
always open.
Did I miss anything on the final
Did I miss anything on the final
checklist here? I just want to make sure
checklist here? I just want to make sure
I have
everything. I guess DDP.
everything. I guess DDP.
So we need
So we need
like
like
tuned EDP plus
tuned EDP plus
um compile plus
um compile plus
am
check. I'm trying to think if there's
check. I'm trying to think if there's
anything else we need to do for release
anything else we need to do for release
because I I've got like another 10-ish
because I I've got like another 10-ish
minutes now and I just I want to have
minutes now and I just I want to have
the full picture because I basically
the full picture because I basically
what I want to do is I want to set
what I want to do is I want to set
myself up so for the whole rest of today
myself up so for the whole rest of today
and then tomorrow I don't have to like
and then tomorrow I don't have to like
keep going back to this. I want to just
keep going back to this. I want to just
be able to go right. I want to just be
be able to go right. I want to just be
able to like do the dev
able to like do the dev
Oops. And um and just hammer this all
Oops. And um and just hammer this all
out.
Docs. You forgot
Docs. You forgot
docs. New
docs.
Updated. Is that everything?
This is the biggest one
here. And packaging. These are the two
here. And packaging. These are the two
hardest ones is like getting the code in
hardest ones is like getting the code in
a state I'm happy with cuz I'm
a state I'm happy with cuz I'm
picky. And then
packaging. I'm pretty confident we can
packaging. I'm pretty confident we can
get good baselines on
everything. This we basically already
everything. This we basically already
did. These are easy
did. These are easy
experiments. This is just like busy
experiments. This is just like busy
work.
I guess I do have to make sure rest of
I guess I do have to make sure rest of
M's are
ported. I guess.
Okay. So if I do this then what's the
Okay. So if I do this then what's the
release going to look like? Oh yeah the
release going to look like? Oh yeah the
blog
obviously. So this is going to be
obviously. So this is going to be
protein which is our new hyperp sweep
protein which is our new hyperp sweep
algorithm.
algorithm.
This is going to
This is going to
cover
um puffer advantage plus
filtering which is like our algo side
stuff.
stuff.
Oh yeah. I was wondering why that got so
Oh yeah. I was wondering why that got so
loud in the background.
loud in the background.
Turns out that rain on a metal warehouse
Turns out that rain on a metal warehouse
roof is uh pretty
loud. Hopefully the uh noise filter
loud. Hopefully the uh noise filter
catches most of
it. Protein puffer advantage
it. Protein puffer advantage
filtering
filtering
CAPI. What other stuff should I put in
CAPI. What other stuff should I put in
um the release that would be hype? The
um the release that would be hype? The
new M's obviously.
Maybe like a
speedun, something like that.
I mean, the really the big thing about
I mean, the really the big thing about
this
release. Yeah, those are all the topics
release. Yeah, those are all the topics
I want to cover, I think, in there.
That's
That's
good. I think this is this is about
good. I think this is this is about
enough for
enough for
release if we do all
this. So, let me uh let me just bullet
this. So, let me uh let me just bullet
this out so I know what I'm doing today.
this out so I know what I'm doing today.
And then I'm going for breakfast in a
And then I'm going for breakfast in a
few and then I'll be back and I'm going
few and then I'll be back and I'm going
to start with this whole cleanup, I
to start with this whole cleanup, I
think. So this is going to be like
think. So this is going to be like
Neptune

That
everything I'm warning
lip range for continuous pulse. Oh yeah,
continuous. Well, I don't know if you
continuous. Well, I don't know if you
actually want to have
continuous. Maybe, maybe we'll do
that. And that should be everything.
Okay, Araga, we we don't currently do uh
Okay, Araga, we we don't currently do uh
internships. This is all like open
internships. This is all like open
source stuff. We do a small amount of uh
source stuff. We do a small amount of uh
paid work for clients in RL, but then
paid work for clients in RL, but then
the people I put on those are either uh
the people I put on those are either uh
PhD students I've worked with
PhD students I've worked with
previously and I know I work well with
previously and I know I work well with
or top contributors uh to Puffer Lib who
or top contributors uh to Puffer Lib who
I know can get the work done. We don't
I know can get the work done. We don't
do like random random like uh you know
do like random random like uh you know
fixed time position hires intern or
fixed time position hires intern or
full-time
either. And that's just mainly because
either. And that's just mainly because
of the way the uh the company is uh is
of the way the uh the company is uh is
run. Like the income for the company is
run. Like the income for the company is
from clients. We don't have funding or
from clients. We don't have funding or
other stuff. So, it's like we hire
other stuff. So, it's like we hire
people to do things for clients, not
people to do things for clients, not
like general pull-time for a puffer.
Was there anything else I wanted to do?
Was there anything else I wanted to do?
Oh yeah, you also I wanted to check
um whether you need multiple data
um whether you need multiple data
points, right?
Well, I can put that in here. Do
Well, I can put that in here. Do
you need multiple
you need multiple
sweets per
run? All right, that should be
run? All right, that should be
everything
everything
here. Hey, Spencer. Yeah, let me take a
here. Hey, Spencer. Yeah, let me take a
quick look at your sweep, though. I'm
quick look at your sweep, though. I'm
going to have to go any second for
going to have to go any second for
breakfast. You know, thanks for your
breakfast. You know, thanks for your
interest to Argy here. It's just the way
interest to Argy here. It's just the way
that Puffer works. We're very heavily
that Puffer works. We're very heavily
trying to bootstrap this. So, we can't
trying to bootstrap this. So, we can't
just like randomly be hiring uh interns
just like randomly be hiring uh interns
when there's not like income coming from
when there's not like income coming from
those interns or clients
specifically. So, I don't like to
specifically. So, I don't like to
advertise to people like, "Hey, if you
advertise to people like, "Hey, if you
come do a bunch of free work, maybe
come do a bunch of free work, maybe
there's a position for you." Because
there's a position for you." Because
that's kind of jank. Um it's more so
that's kind of jank. Um it's more so
just like people contribute who want to
just like people contribute who want to
learn and contribute and then you know
learn and contribute and then you know
if people get good enough we pull the
if people get good enough we pull the
like we can pull people from community
like we can pull people from community
into gigs when they make sense but there
into gigs when they make sense but there
are no guarantees on
that. Let's see. Let's see your sweep,
Spencer. Please link
sweep. And actually, I just I'll say for
sweep. And actually, I just I'll say for
the people watching because I got to go
the people watching because I got to go
in a second. I will be back after
in a second. I will be back after
breakfast for the whole rest of the day.
breakfast for the whole rest of the day.
So, all my stuff here is on puffer.ai.
So, all my stuff here is on puffer.ai.
Want to help me out for free to start
Want to help me out for free to start
the repo. If you want to get involved
the repo. If you want to get involved
with open source dev, just join the
with open source dev, just join the
Discord. You don't need an RL
Discord. You don't need an RL
background, just need a programming
background, just need a programming
background. Uh, most of our top
background. Uh, most of our top
contributors came in with no RL
contributors came in with no RL
background whatsoever. And also follow
background whatsoever. And also follow
me on X for more RL content.
Okay, here's the sweep. Spencer, just
Okay, here's the sweep. Spencer, just
link. Oh, you are in the
link. Oh, you are in the
chat. Yo,
you're muted, but how's it going,
you're muted, but how's it going,
Spencer? Yo, all right. So,
Spencer? Yo, all right. So,
but completion rate is good.
but completion rate is good.
Okay. Um, so the score technically now
Okay. Um, so the score technically now
should
be clean executions
be clean executions
before of a like a a clean completion

Before hitting

policy, it actually looks pretty decent.
policy, it actually looks pretty decent.
And I think the reason why the score is
And I think the reason why the score is
coming down low on that is due to the
coming down low on that is due to the
respawn stuff. Okay. So, I mean it's
respawn stuff. Okay. So, I mean it's
good now we're just down to like a
good now we're just down to like a
little bit of MJ jank on this for the
little bit of MJ jank on this for the
most part. And
most part. And
um yeah, I think you'll have this and
um yeah, I think you'll have this and
the new M to play around with. Um and we
the new M to play around with. Um and we
can just go back and forth on stuff for
can just go back and forth on stuff for
these. We will have to figure out the
these. We will have to figure out the
speed at some point, but I think we can
speed at some point, but I think we can
do that after.
do that after.
Um, it's probably just going to be a
Um, it's probably just going to be a
matter of cutting out redundant obs.
matter of cutting out redundant obs.
Yeah, I think that's probably going to
Yeah, I think that's probably going to
be most of it. So, I was thinking what
be most of it. So, I was thinking what
I'll do is I was going
I'll do is I was going
to change how this the collisions are
to change how this the collisions are
recognized. Mhm. Um, such that
recognized. Mhm. Um, such that
collisions are only
collisions are only
recognized
recognized
if it is prior to you reaching your
if it is prior to you reaching your
first goal. And like if you run into a
first goal. And like if you run into a
car that has already reached its goal on
car that has already reached its goal on
their second life, then it doesn't count
their second life, then it doesn't count
as a collision.
as a collision.
Are you still going to get negative
Are you still going to get negative
reward though?
reward though?
Well, that's the part I was going to
Well, that's the part I was going to
take out. Well, you they need to still
take out. Well, you they need to still
get a negative reward for colliding if
get a negative reward for colliding if
you want them to not learn to just go
you want them to not learn to just go
through each
through each
other cuz if they're only re if they
other cuz if they're only re if they
only get a penalty for colliding on the
only get a penalty for colliding on the
first time, then like it's questionable
first time, then like it's questionable
whether they actually learn to stop
whether they actually learn to stop
colliding. Like they could actually
colliding. Like they could actually
learn after I after I get the goal once
learn after I after I get the goal once
or whatever, I can collide as much as I
or whatever, I can collide as much as I
want.
want.
What if I add an observation that is
What if I add an observation that is
like have has that agent reached its
like have has that agent reached its
goal and you can see it
goal and you can see it
because arguably you should be able to
because arguably you should be able to
phase through another car in the second
phase through another car in the second
life.
I mean the main thing you're learning
I mean the main thing you're learning
like not colliding with stationary walls
like not colliding with stationary walls
should be learnable very easily. The
should be learnable very easily. The
main thing you are learning is avoiding
main thing you are learning is avoiding
collision. I we need to think of a good
collision. I we need to think of a good
way to handle
way to handle
this. That's
like I wonder if the spawn immunity just
like I wonder if the spawn immunity just
covers
it. Right.
it. Right.
Well, that's what I was offering was
Well, that's what I was offering was
just like collisions don't count if but
just like collisions don't count if but
it would be like it doesn't count for a
it would be like it doesn't count for a
few like I mean you could do it for like
few like I mean you could do it for like
10 time steps or whatever or like it
10 time steps or whatever or like it
would have to be for like some fixed
would have to be for like some fixed
number of time steps. So we'd have to
number of time steps. So we'd have to
like look like how long roughly these
like look like how long roughly these
time steps are cuz the idea is like if a
time steps are cuz the idea is like if a
car spawns right in front of you and
car spawns right in front of you and
you're already going that direction, you
you're already going that direction, you
should be able to go through it.
Correct.
Correct.
Um, off-road rate is pretty much solved
Um, off-road rate is pretty much solved
at this point. It's 6%.
at this point. It's 6%.
Okay, good. So, it's entirely collision
Okay, good. So, it's entirely collision
rate because completion rate is getting
rate because completion rate is getting
up to 95% now. And then car collision
up to 95% now. And then car collision
still like 20% of which I probably a
still like 20% of which I probably a
bunch of it is. Yeah, it's just it's
bunch of it is. Yeah, it's just it's
just the respawn things. Okay, cool. And
just the respawn things. Okay, cool. And
then so yeah, I mean some degree of
then so yeah, I mean some degree of
spawn immunity. And then second thing to
spawn immunity. And then second thing to
look at is
uh what was I going to say? Oh,
uh what was I going to say? Oh,
confirming from the actual original GPU
confirming from the actual original GPU
drive environment that their cars the
drive environment that their cars the
cars that they're spawning are the same
cars that they're spawning are the same
cars that I'm spawning in the agents
cars that I'm spawning in the agents
that I'm are considering to be agents
that I'm are considering to be agents
because I can't do that really on my
because I can't do that really on my
computer.
Yeah. No, we will we'll make sure of
Yeah. No, we will we'll make sure of
that. Don't worry. I'll like I'll have
that. Don't worry. I'll like I'll have
to set it up locally, but I'll do that.
Okay. But so for now, do you think just
Okay. But so for now, do you think just
doing spawn try spawn immunity and see
doing spawn try spawn immunity and see
how it goes? Um yeah, do like a few
how it goes? Um yeah, do like a few
frame spawn immunity and uh see how that
frame spawn immunity and uh see how that
goes and rerun sweep. See if we get like
goes and rerun sweep. See if we get like
close to one. By the way, this sweep was
close to one. By the way, this sweep was
with a kneeling on and then solved in
with a kneeling on and then solved in
like 70 million. Do you want me to go a
like 70 million. Do you want me to go a
non- annealing sweep?
non- annealing sweep?
Uh if you're solving, it doesn't matter.
Uh if you're solving, it doesn't matter.
The kneeling only matters if um a
The kneeling only matters if um a
kneeling off only matters for stuff like
kneeling off only matters for stuff like
neural MMO where you're doing a a very
neural MMO where you're doing a a very
short sweep to try to predict a very
short sweep to try to predict a very
long run.
long run.
Okay. All right. Sounds good. Cool.
Okay. All right. Sounds good. Cool.
Okay. Uh the plan for me for the today
Okay. Uh the plan for me for the today
is going to be to like clean up pretty
is going to be to like clean up pretty
much the whole rest of Puffer. We got
much the whole rest of Puffer. We got
some amazing results overnight on meta.
some amazing results overnight on meta.
So like it's in a very good spot. I just
So like it's in a very good spot. I just
there's like a whole bunch of stuff I
there's like a whole bunch of stuff I
want to clean up. So, we have the stable
want to clean up. So, we have the stable
final version of the transcript.
