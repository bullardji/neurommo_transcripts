okay we are back
okay we are back
live
live
um and I where are these Bots get out of
here where's
x a
messages I get a your Discord thing I
messages I get a your Discord thing I
saw a message somewhere oh there it is
M was
M was
4% I One update epoch
ha
ha
330k very
nice I'll fix this [ __ ] for him that's
nice I'll fix this [ __ ] for him that's
no big deal it's
easy what the hell is this
let me go check this one other thing and
let me go check this one other thing and
uh then we'll get back to
this oh
cool
for e
right cool we are good all cut up on
right cool we are good all cut up on
messages believe
good
good
okay let's look at our experiments first
okay let's look at our experiments first
this seems like it actually kind of did
this seems like it actually kind of did
something
something
um
um
oops this seems like it actually kind of
oops this seems like it actually kind of
did something which I'm
did something which I'm
surprised cuz I thought that this was
surprised cuz I thought that this was
really stupid
really stupid
um Okay so
so see so this is the one from
so see so this is the one from
before this goes up
before this goes up
to 28 2900 so this doesn't quite get
to 28 2900 so this doesn't quite get
there um and it gets up to like here on
there um and it gets up to like here on
the total time
the total time
steps and then if we look at this
one
one
interesting so this is still a very
interesting so this is still a very
clean set of
clean set of
Curves um and actually the time steps
Curves um and actually the time steps
are nice too it's got these like two
are nice too it's got these like two
Divergent paths which is a little
Divergent paths which is a little
weird but it's not it's not doing as
weird but it's not it's not doing as
well
well
overall let's see
overall let's see
why this is like a very
tight this is very interesting
tight this is very interesting
um I didn't expect this out the
gate this is almost tighter than the
gate this is almost tighter than the
other one and this is
like this is more the shape that we want
like this is more the shape that we want
as well where it's like a very quick
as well where it's like a very quick
Ascent on total time
Ascent on total time
steps this does this this continuity is
steps this does this this continuity is
a little weird but you know
a little weird but you know
whatever um
whatever um
so batch size is correct mini batches
so batch size is correct mini batches
doesn't go to eight okay this gets stuck
doesn't go to eight okay this gets stuck
which is
which is
weird learning rate is way
weird learning rate is way
off is very weird gamma's
off is very weird gamma's
correct uh Lambda is
correct uh Lambda is
correct update epox correct BPT Horizon
correct update epox correct BPT Horizon
is
is
correct uh n Maps get stuck as well that
correct uh n Maps get stuck as well that
should be higher then cost is scaled
should be higher then cost is scaled
nicely whoa oh what the
nicely whoa oh what the
heck double parito
heck double parito
front very
front very
clean but then this doesn't make
clean but then this doesn't make
sense you
see this is like beautifully clean and
see this is like beautifully clean and
then this one this portion is fine but
then this one this portion is fine but
then what is this
right so it's got to be a quirk of the
right so it's got to be a quirk of the
function
function
now I didn't think it was a great
now I didn't think it was a great
function but I don't know why it does
function but I don't know why it does
this
this
specifically
specifically
um let me
um let me
see so this is what we did and I added a
see so this is what we did and I added a
bias to this Improvement term as well
bias to this Improvement term as well
the
bias the bias should just make it non-
bias the bias should just make it non-
negative it's a big bias but that
negative it's a big bias but that
shouldn't
shouldn't
matter so I did Improvement Plus let me
matter so I did Improvement Plus let me
make sure this is right
make sure this is right
yeah so here's the Improvement Plus 100
yeah so here's the Improvement Plus 100
this is
this is
conservative Improvement and then we
conservative Improvement and then we
have conservative
have conservative
absolute and then the thing that I
absolute and then the thing that I
changed here other than this bias was
changed here other than this bias was
that I added or I divided by the cost
estimate so how does this
estimate so how does this
how does this
work not this one where'd it
work not this one where'd it
go so I divided by the cost estimate
so this is 12338 down
so this is 12338 down
here this is a low cost
it's low cost but like it's not
Paro so why does this get
suggested this is bizarre I sure I don't
suggested this is bizarre I sure I don't
have like multiple
336 you know these are from the
336 you know these are from the
same the same runs
same the same runs
right this
right this
three four yeah and here it's like
three four yeah and here it's like
42 this is very very weird
[Music]
[Music]
it's not sampling points on the
Curve
e e
lower cost
points I want to do
next I don't know why this gets stuck
genuinely welcome YouTube folks this is
genuinely welcome YouTube folks this is
Redevelopment of a hyperparameter tuning
Redevelopment of a hyperparameter tuning
algorithm and we're we've got something
algorithm and we're we've got something
that's really good on the synthetic test
that's really good on the synthetic test
but it's just there are a couple last
but it's just there are a couple last
things that I'm not satisfied with yet
things that I'm not satisfied with yet
and uh one of them is the way that it
and uh one of them is the way that it
scales to a longer and longer
scales to a longer and longer
experiments over time
me do this first just to make sure that
me do this first just to make sure that
I'm not totally
trolling it's Bizarro
let me think in the meantime if I can
let me think in the meantime if I can
figure out what this
does oh
does oh
also not cover the
chat yeah this
decent um
acquisition
acquisition
value so Improvement gives
you uniform
you uniform
sampling across the Paro
front right and it's just wherever you
front right and it's just wherever you
can improve the Paro
can improve the Paro
front
now this is annoying because if you have
now this is annoying because if you have
a perfect estimate of the Paro front
a perfect estimate of the Paro front
uh it doesn't mean you can't sample but
uh it doesn't mean you can't sample but
it gives it turns into uniform
it gives it turns into uniform
sampling right so if you have a perfect
sampling right so if you have a perfect
estimate of the Paro front you uniformly
estimate of the Paro front you uniformly
sample around existing parito
points you don't bias towards longer
points you don't bias towards longer
experiments so the goal
is as you get more
is as you get more
confident which generally means that
confident which generally means that
there are fewer places where you improve
there are fewer places where you improve
an expectation that's fine okay so it's
an expectation that's fine okay so it's
it's off of the parito curve fit
it's off of the parito curve fit
really all the sampling is done off the
really all the sampling is done off the
Pito curve fit it's not done off of your
Pito curve fit it's not done off of your
existing experiments
existing experiments
so let's say that you learn a good curve
so let's say that you learn a good curve
bit off of the quicker
bit off of the quicker
runs
runs
okay then
okay then
what so Improvement
what so Improvement
[Music]
[Music]
becomes let's say a
becomes let's say a
uniform it goes to zero really but we're
uniform it goes to zero really but we're
going to add a bias to that so let's say
going to add a bias to that so let's say
it's just
it's just
uniform okay so now you want to
uniform okay so now you want to
bias towards higher
bias towards higher
cost no you don't want to bias towards
cost no you don't want to bias towards
higher cost you want to bias towards
higher cost you want to bias towards
higher performance which can be higher
higher performance which can be higher
cost so absolute performance term does
cost so absolute performance term does
that already without doing the divide by
cost I remember not liking that for some
cost I remember not liking that for some
reason
though and the reason is if you have
like if you have uncertainty across the
like if you have uncertainty across the
whole
whole
front then this can bias you towards
front then this can bias you towards
high
high
cost the thing that you're trying to
cost the thing that you're trying to
express here right is you want to move
express here right is you want to move
towards higher performance as you become
towards higher performance as you become
certain you want to move away from high
certain you want to move away from high
cost as you're
uncertain well wait you always want to
uncertain well wait you always want to
go towards higher
go towards higher
performance and away from high cost
performance and away from high cost
unless you're certain
I don't know about this divide by cost
function
e e
this is
tricky okay so your base is going to
be I don't know about this
either your base acquisition
either your base acquisition
function it's Improvement times absolute
performance and that seems
like that seems
good and then there should be a cost
good and then there should be a cost
penalty
that reduces with modal
confidence is that
confidence is that
good so model uncertainty we have that's
good so model uncertainty we have that's
just just the variance in the cost
just just the variance in the cost
prediction
I don't think this cost penalty term is
I don't think this cost penalty term is
well
formulated does this even make sense
formulated does this even make sense
what this is trying to do
I mean you're probably pretty damn
I mean you're probably pretty damn
accurate on the cost of stuff it's
accurate on the cost of stuff it's
really easy to predict that
does this bias really screw screwing up
does this bias really screw screwing up
the
algorithm that'd be
algorithm that'd be
weird
weird
right 50 this looks like it could be or
right 50 this looks like it could be or
52 uh
52800 I think this was way better
right yeah look at
right yeah look at
that even this one is
that even this one is
better then that we didn't even look at
better then that we didn't even look at
this one
this is a lot
better that's weird that that bias term
better that's weird that that bias term
would mess stuff
would mess stuff
up I'll let it run a little longer just
up I'll let it run a little longer just
to be sure but
um and time steps are interesting
um and time steps are interesting
here well this is I mean this is bad
here well this is I mean this is bad
this is uh too early to do this didn't
this is uh too early to do this didn't
explore bat didn't explore anything
explore bat didn't explore anything
yeah so that's kind of weird
this is definitely bad okay well what if
this is definitely bad okay well what if
I get rid of this bias
because let's just try this empirically
because let's just try this empirically
I have no idea if this should do
I have no idea if this should do
anything I don't honestly think it
anything I don't honestly think it
should
should
uh cost no
uh cost no
bias I honestly don't think that they
bias I honestly don't think that they
should do anything but we'll try it
I think you're still going to get the
I think you're still going to get the
weird
split I mean here's the other thing I
split I mean here's the other thing I
can do
can do
right I can just look
right I can just look
at this is the weird
at this is the weird
one this
one this
one so this is the best run that I have
it gets batch mini batch the only thing
it gets batch mini batch the only thing
it screws up for whatever weird reason
it screws up for whatever weird reason
is it doesn't get the learning rate it
is it doesn't get the learning rate it
gets gamma nicely it gets Lambda
gets gamma nicely it gets Lambda
nicely it's update Epoch
nicely it's update Epoch
Horizon this gets
Horizon this gets
everything the only two issues with this
everything the only two issues with this
so for whatever reason it doesn't get
so for whatever reason it doesn't get
learning rate but a lot of them have
learning rate but a lot of them have
that
that
problem and then the total time steps
problem and then the total time steps
doesn't go up fast
doesn't go up fast
enough this should really go up way
enough this should really go up way
faster because
like this Improvement is all just from
like this Improvement is all just from
time
step I mean that's a very simple
step I mean that's a very simple
experiment to
experiment to
run to just like double the time
run to just like double the time
step
waiting we'll run this first
I mean something still feels wrong to me
I mean something still feels wrong to me
about this
though
like all I do is absolute performance
like all I do is absolute performance
times
times
cost I me absolute performance this is
cost I me absolute performance this is
All I
All I
Do by what mechanism does this control
cost there's literally no penalty for
cost there's literally no penalty for
sampling longer and longer
runs like early
runs like early
how do you get 4,000 m's on a
CPU these are all written in C they run
CPU these are all written in C they run
a m like they run a million steps per
a m like they run a million steps per
second on One Core minimum so you
second on One Core minimum so you
literally just run them serially in a
literally just run them serially in a
loop on One Core that's
it nothing
it nothing
magic so of them are a little heavier so
magic so of them are a little heavier so
we multiprocess them maybe we use two
we multiprocess them maybe we use two
cores for some of them a couple of them
cores for some of them a couple of them
a few more than that but
a few more than that but
yeah they're just really really
fast they're not that hard to write
fast they're not that hard to write
either we've got all sorts of brand new
either we've got all sorts of brand new
RL people contributing these like I
RL people contributing these like I
wrote nurl Mo MOA and uh snake the rest
wrote nurl Mo MOA and uh snake the rest
of them are contributed by our users
I code review all of them and I edit
I code review all of them and I edit
them and stuff but the main
them and stuff but the main
implementation is by
contributors I'm still not happy with
contributors I'm still not happy with
the way that this algorithm interacts
the way that this algorithm interacts
with with
cost I think under this formulation
cost I think under this formulation
just
this so what is num M's referring to in
this so what is num M's referring to in
your sweep on GPU it's typically
your sweep on GPU it's typically
referred to the number of M's running
referred to the number of M's running
yes literally that so we are
yes literally that so we are
running it doesn't necess they don't
running it doesn't necess they don't
have to run in parallel though like you
have to run in parallel though like you
get a batch of 4,000
get a batch of 4,000
observations but they're run in serial
observations but they're run in serial
it's just that they run so fast that you
it's just that they run so fast that you
don't notice
like our training will have 0% Z to 1%
like our training will have 0% Z to 1%
of the time spent running the
of the time spent running the
environment it's actually better than

the GPU environments a lot of them
the GPU environments a lot of them
because they waste time running they
because they waste time running they
waste GPU time running the

implementations are actually slower than

like gpus are not designed to run

only reason that people have gone crazy

over GPU environments outside of like
over GPU environments outside of like
High Fidelity physics is because like
High Fidelity physics is because like
researchers really want to write Python
researchers really want to write Python
and uh it turns out if you just write
and uh it turns out if you just write
stuff in C it's
stuff in C it's
faster I'm being a little bit faes here
faster I'm being a little bit faes here
like we did some additional optimization
like we did some additional optimization
there's some fancy shared memory stuff
there's some fancy shared memory stuff
um but if you look at the code it's
um but if you look at the code it's
really easy to write these things like
really easy to write these things like
the CPU environment code is dramatically
the CPU environment code is dramatically
simpler than GPU environment code like
simpler than GPU environment code like
compare puffer environments to like
compare puffer environments to like
Jack's environments it is so much less
Jack's environments it is so much less
painful to write our our CPU environment
painful to write our our CPU environment
and they're faster
I'm really not happy with the way that
this I'm pretty sure what's happening
this I'm pretty sure what's happening
here as lame as this is I'm pretty sure
here as lame as this is I'm pretty sure
what's
what's
happening is just total time step starts
happening is just total time step starts
out
out
low and it just takes a while uh because
low and it just takes a while uh because
the standard deviation of the search
the standard deviation of the search
space for this parameter so low it just
space for this parameter so low it just
takes a while to increase
takes a while to increase
it so like essentially it's just you
it so like essentially it's just you
have until the algorithm bumps this
have until the algorithm bumps this
parameter up too much because it's going
parameter up too much because it's going
to bump this parameter up because it
to bump this parameter up because it
gets better perf out of it um so you
gets better perf out of it um so you
just have it until it bumps this
just have it until it bumps this
parameter up to hopefully fit all the
parameter up to hopefully fit all the
other
other
parameters which like it happens to do
parameters which like it happens to do
in this case relatively well there a
in this case relatively well there a
couple quirks
that's not how it should
work it should have an explicit
work it should have an explicit
mechanism for
mechanism for
increasing increasing cost as it becomes
increasing increasing cost as it becomes
what
what
[Music]
confident yeah confident
I mean I guess that is actually what
I mean I guess that is actually what
happens to be fair because we have a
happens to be fair because we have a
conservative bound on stuff
conservative bound on stuff
right wait a second we have a
right wait a second we have a
conservative
bound if it's written in C can you not
bound if it's written in C can you not
like write a rapper M that runs multiple
like write a rapper M that runs multiple
versions of the environment across
versions of the environment across
threads or is it just not necessary uh
threads or is it just not necessary uh
we have vectorization as well yeah we do
we have vectorization as well yeah we do
we have the best multi-processing out
we have the best multi-processing out
there in fact so yes you can run you can
there in fact so yes you can run you can
run a th000 environments per core and
run a th000 environments per core and
you can run on 16 cores if you'd like in
you can run on 16 cores if you'd like in
fact we do that for a few of our
fact we do that for a few of our
environments that are a little slower or
environments that are a little slower or
not even a little slower they have more
not even a little slower they have more
bandwidth really um but most of our
bandwidth really um but most of our
environments are just so fast that one
environments are just so fast that one
or two cores and you're
good mostly the ones are slow is the
good mostly the ones are slow is the
ones that are slower just because we're
ones that are slower just because we're
using like fancy opponent AI that takes
using like fancy opponent AI that takes
a while to compute
a while to compute
we'll get to improving those
we'll get to improving those
though I mean you can go read any of our
though I mean you can go read any of our
environments they're all open source and
environments they're all open source and
they're like they're one file a piece
they're like they're one file a piece
they're super simple like people go ask
they're super simple like people go ask
C you know I don't want to read C it's

really easy C like look at this so uh
really easy C like look at this so uh
puffer lib

ocean snake so this is massively
ocean snake so this is massively
multi-agent snake I think this runs like
multi-agent snake I think this runs like
I don't know 5 10 million steps a second
I don't know 5 10 million steps a second
this is the whole code 300 lines this is

just binds it to uh this is just an

intermediary that binds C to python via
intermediary that binds C to python via
cython it also runs the loop over over a
cython it also runs the loop over over a

stuff and then snake. p is just a tiny
little stub that has uh you know the

it there's no magic and they all look

like this pretty much like neural MMO is
like this pretty much like neural MMO is
one of the most complicated RL
one of the most complicated RL
environments out there and it's one file
environments out there and it's one file
it's going to be 3,000 lines 2800 lines
it's going to be 3,000 lines 2800 lines
but just like one file of really simple
but just like one file of really simple
code so this scales as well you can go
code so this scales as well you can go
from very very simple environments to
from very very simple environments to
very very complicated environments like
very very complicated environments like
this and they'll all be
fast neural mo3 is like 1.9 million
fast neural mo3 is like 1.9 million
steps per second on One
Core it's a fun time come right to
Core it's a fun time come right to
environment with us
this year is a somewhat Less Fun Time
this year is a somewhat Less Fun Time
this is a bunch of math and it's hurting
this is a bunch of math and it's hurting
my head
today but it's very
today but it's very
important so I will do
it there is kind of implicitly a time
it there is kind of implicitly a time
management thing in
here so
the absolute
the absolute
performance is going to bias you towards
performance is going to bias you towards
longer runs but only if you're confident
longer runs but only if you're confident
because it's a conservative
because it's a conservative
bound and because you start off running
bound and because you start off running
shorter
shorter
runs you're not allowed to run longer
runs you're not allowed to run longer
runs until you're confident
so I don't think you need to actually
so I don't think you need to actually
penalize cost I think you already have
penalize cost I think you already have
cost
cost
penalized you have it penalized VI
uncertainty because it's not actually
uncertainty because it's not actually
bad to run high cost experiments it's
bad to run high cost experiments it's
only bad to
only bad to
run high cost experiments that you're
run high cost experiments that you're
wrong about and don't do well you want
wrong about and don't do well you want
to run higher and higher cost
to run higher and higher cost
experiments in fact you want to run the
experiments in fact you want to run the
higher cost experiments ASAP as soon as
higher cost experiments ASAP as soon as
you're confident in them
I could experiment with an even more
I could experiment with an even more
conservative
conservative
bound I could do two standard deviation
bound that's like a really conservative
bound that's like a really conservative
bound
bound
right does that do anything for you
maybe let's see what this one is I don't
maybe let's see what this one is I don't
think that this is done very well let's
think that this is done very well let's
check I'd be surprised it's
check I'd be surprised it's
theoretically it's poorly
theoretically it's poorly
motivated it's possible empirically it
motivated it's possible empirically it
does
okay where did I put it I have way too
okay where did I put it I have way too
many freaking Windows uh let's just
many freaking Windows uh let's just
close some of these
I need
this ah where my windows go
how I get over
there so
there so
1,200 and 75
experiments where's our Pito
experiments where's our Pito
from the hell there it
from the hell there it
is all right clean parito front but I
is all right clean parito front but I
think that this is just lower perf
think that this is just lower perf
overall this is 1200
at it's 1,200 like
at it's 1,200 like
[Music]
[Music]
versus
it yeah so this is the worst one and
it yeah so this is the worst one and
it's still worse than this
this
this
one yeah there we
one yeah there we
go so this is just not that
good not very good which is expected
good not very good which is expected
because this doesn't make any
because this doesn't make any
sense so get rid of
this and let's just
this and let's just
do let's just increase some parameters
this could
this could
potentially change quite a
potentially change quite a
bit so this is our best right
now and this is like almost perfect
now and this is like almost perfect
it could literally just be tuning some
it could literally just be tuning some
scale parameters from here to be
honest you
know oh look at
know oh look at
that well these are going to be too
that well these are going to be too
long to start with potentially
think you start the time even lower but
think you start the time even lower but
with a bigger scale
with a bigger scale
maybe it's a little
tricky to do
that dynamically growing the cost is
that dynamically growing the cost is
difficult
yeah dynamically growing the cost will
yeah dynamically growing the cost will
be
difficult let me
think so the difficult thing here is
if I just do this based around like
if I just do this based around like
total time steps
total time steps
right the initial
right the initial
samples are going to be around that time
samples are going to be around that time
scale the initial samples are going to
scale the initial samples are going to
be like
randomish so I mean if I do like a
100 I don't want to start at a 100
100 I don't want to start at a 100
million but be randomly sampling 500
million but be randomly sampling 500
million that's going to take for
million that's going to take for
freaking ever
you really want a better way of
you really want a better way of
dynamically
dynamically
growing growing the
compute you really want a much better
compute you really want a much better
way of dynamically growing the compute
well to be fair I think the current
well to be fair I think the current
thing I have
is it's really just the
initialization that's difficult right
initialization that's difficult right
like cuz I think that the method I have
like cuz I think that the method I have
at the
at the
moment it should actually work very well
moment it should actually work very well
it's just keeping the
keeping the cost below to begin
with you could penalize cost uncertain
with you could penalize cost uncertain
cost
cost
actually if you penalize cost when there
actually if you penalize cost when there
is uncertainty that could fix it
yeah I think that actually might be the
yeah I think that actually might be the
way because that will prevent you that
way because that will prevent you that
will like push your uh that should push

is it cost times cost

I mean the people saying that like this

it's

free I gave Claud C custom instructions
then it added an additional sense to the

no this is so dumb
already star very good the puffer thanks
already star very good the puffer thanks
you for your

maybe it doesn't have to be a continuous
function you
know yeah it would be better if it were
it's got to be
like it's got to be like Max
one and then like
I'm not reading that [ __ ]
I'm not reading that [ __ ]
[Music]
[Music]
anyways Max
zero
for e
this it
what do you want this function to
what do you want this function to
do I want it to be a cost
do I want it to be a cost
penalty um it should penalize you if
penalty um it should penalize you if
your cost is it should penalize you for
your cost is it should penalize you for
select a high cost when you have high
select a high cost when you have high
uncertainty about the cost so the
uncertainty about the cost so the
function has to go to one when your cost
function has to go to one when your cost
certainty which is the standard
certainty which is the standard
deviation is below a specific threshold
deviation is below a specific threshold
and then it has to smoothly it has to be
and then it has to smoothly it has to be
a continuous function that scales up
a continuous function that scales up
based on the cost from
there this is
there this is
close the only thing is that this is
which does require you to subtract the
which does require you to subtract the
threshold from the scaling
Factor Why would you square it
that's a Max of
that's a Max of
zero and standard
zero and standard
[Music]
deviation does that work I don't know if
deviation does that work I don't know if
that
that
works if that does work then I'm
works if that does work then I'm
incredibly tired for not figuring that
incredibly tired for not figuring that
out let me see but I don't think it does
out let me see but I don't think it does
so
so
cost times the max
yeah that's a bad
yeah that's a bad
idea you should keep it linear there's
idea you should keep it linear there's
no reason to square
no reason to square
that
that
um I've been staring at this map all
day
day
well the only thing there is the
well the only thing there is the
standard deviation minus
the
the
threshold I think you have to divide by
threshold I think you have to divide by
threshold if you do that no we're not
threshold if you do that no we're not
[ __ ] exponentiating it either [ __ ]
[ __ ] exponentiating it either [ __ ]
that
um I think it might be hold
um I think it might be hold
on cost times
Max does this do it
if threshold is
0.5 I think that fixes the thing where
0.5 I think that fixes the thing where
because you subtract the
threshold well
threshold well
because you're scaling it down by
because you're scaling it down by
subtracting the threshold from the
subtracting the threshold from the
standard deviation
right you have to do that to have the
right you have to do that to have the
threshold but you're scaling down the
threshold but you're scaling down the
standard
standard
deviation I guess wait the one plus kind
deviation I guess wait the one plus kind
of covers
it does that do it
I think we'll try
I think we'll try
this how's uh this sweep
this how's uh this sweep
going it looks like this one's going
going it looks like this one's going
pretty damn
well what in the [ __ ]

so that it like it latches on to you see

it's weird lambda's way
off Lambda is supposed to be 0.95 so I
off Lambda is supposed to be 0.95 so I
have no idea how it drifts like this we
have no idea how it drifts like this we
can adjust the scales and [ __ ] though

it's down here this is very weird these
it's down here this is very weird these

good and then cost is like this oh wait
but this is actually a Pito front
but this is actually a Pito front
I thought it was going to give us the
I thought it was going to give us the
weird curve again but this is actually
weird curve again but this is actually
good um yeah this is actually very

good so these points
here AB 12 27 like this is very very

very nice for a Pito front here I don't
very nice for a Pito front here I don't

don't know if it's full solved is the
don't know if it's full solved is the
only thing it's almost full solved but
only thing it's almost full solved but
it missed one parameter learning rate
let me try this
let me try this
um this cost
penalty I don't even think we need this
penalty I don't even think we need this
to be honest now cuz this is so good but
so ciruit model outputs
many Bruns are we at Are we almost done
many Bruns are we at Are we almost done
with this I can just do this in a

separate tab right
cops e
it's so
long my break
long my break

okay
so where is the cost

can even get a 10 gab connection there
though for
though for
functional I mean the main thing that's
functional I mean the main thing that's
gone wrong with the small cluster is
gone wrong with the small cluster is
just the micro code [ __ ]
right and I'll talk to linky the next

voice slow
internet well I don't know what we're
internet well I don't know what we're

going to be able to do about that I
don't know if we can get um 10 gigabit
don't know if we can get um 10 gigabit
out there I might have to bandwidth
out there I might have to bandwidth

Neptune which I can bandwidth optimize
puffer for that just by packing stuff
puffer for that just by packing stuff
tighter
there's internet there's at least a
there's internet there's at least a

gabit I yeah I can do starlink but I
gabit I yeah I can do starlink but I
think that's
worse I can get it as a backup no
worse I can get it as a backup no
problem though
I look we'll talk let me finish this
I look we'll talk let me finish this
this is
this is
important
important
um what the [ __ ] is where's the cost
um what the [ __ ] is where's the cost
variance
variance
here where the hell is the cost variance
now Target bear is
now Target bear is
different
right yeah see this is surrogate to
right yeah see this is surrogate to
surrogate output
oh wait log cost there
can I just call this on the variance
I probably can
right
e e
ooh look at
ooh look at
this very very good 3200 that's that's a
this very very good 3200 that's that's a
new
new

uh bet I can tell you what this
is e
good
good
job
job
yeah I mean that's freaking good
right not this one
yeah that's real good I don't know what
yeah that's real good I don't know what
it is at the very end let's see what it
it is at the very end let's see what it
discovers at the very
end think this is
end think this is
fine the gamma I guess it fits gamma oh
fine the gamma I guess it fits gamma oh
it fits gamma and Lambda a little bit
it fits gamma and Lambda a little bit
better at the very end so we got to
better at the very end so we got to
figure out why these things don't fit
figure out why these things don't fit
properly like it it misses a few
properly like it it misses a few
parameters for too long
parameters for too long
this is close to Optimal
though what m is this this is a
though what m is this this is a
synthetic test
this has cost
this has cost
variance
weird okay we'll figure this out
I think it's it's 30 it's 3,000
I think it's it's 30 it's 3,000
something it's pretty close to what
something it's pretty close to what
we're
we're
at like I said it's just a synthetic
at like I said it's just a synthetic
test but
still oh
you
see I wouldn't get too excited yet
this could just be like
this could just be like
Randomness that doesn't
scale but to give you an idea that
scale but to give you an idea that
like original carbs was getting maybe a
like original carbs was getting maybe a

score so we have dramatically improved
score so we have dramatically improved
this algorithm
um at least on the synthetic task right
um at least on the synthetic task right
we're assuming that it
transfers if this like if this actually
transfers if this like if this actually
transfers to our other environments
transfers to our other environments
we're basically we'll have solved hyper
we're basically we'll have solved hyper
pram sweeps for RL or at least like
pram sweeps for RL or at least like
improved it several fold in the course
improved it several fold in the course
of a day and a
half I high score I think it's 3500 I
half I high score I think it's 3500 I
think I
think I
checked I can double check in a bit but
checked I can double check in a bit but
I think it's like
I think it's like
3500 like I said it's a synthetic task
3500 like I said it's a synthetic task
so I mean all it does is it assigns you
so I mean all it does is it assigns you
it assigns optimal values to the hyper
it assigns optimal values to the hyper
parameters um it defines like absolute
parameters um it defines like absolute
value distance penalty from those
value distance penalty from those
parameters and then it sets some some
parameters and then it sets some some
scaling parameters for um for cost
scaling parameters for um for cost
it's
it's
roughly models an RL problem but there's
roughly models an RL problem but there's
no noise in
no noise in
it so all your estimates are
perfect I think we're not going to need
perfect I think we're not going to need
this this extra little bit here I think
this this extra little bit here I think
we're just going to tune parameters and
we're just going to tune parameters and
be
be
good I mean potentially cost penalty is
good I mean potentially cost penalty is
kind of a reasonable thing to
do but like do you really need
it e
yeah I think this is
worse the way it biases cost isn't
worse the way it biases cost isn't
amazing
but it's
decent this is just a
test yeah this isn't
great I mean the parito front looks
great I mean the parito front looks
pretty
nice it is doing lowcost runs which is
nice it is doing lowcost runs which is
what you want
lambda's fit
lambda's fit
correctly gamma's fit
correctly learning rate
is kind of fit
correctly might want to give it a little
correctly might want to give it a little
time it's actually kind of doing the
time it's actually kind of doing the
correct thing
here so the goal here
is you don't just take into account
is you don't just take into account
score here
score here
um ideally what you want is you want
um ideally what you want is you want
your algorithm to run a ton of really
your algorithm to run a ton of really
fast experiments until it's very
fast experiments until it's very
confident that it understands how all
confident that it understands how all
the hyper parameters scale and then it
the hyper parameters scale and then it
runs like a couple midscale experiments
runs like a couple midscale experiments
to make sure that its fit is correct and
to make sure that its fit is correct and
then it runs the big experiments quite
then it runs the big experiments quite
quickly so you want to spend most of
quickly so you want to spend most of
your most of your experiment count on
your most of your experiment count on
Fast
experiments uh it shouldn't need early
experiments uh it shouldn't need early
stopping you could technically do it but
stopping you could technically do it but
the thing is this is It's cost aware so
the thing is this is It's cost aware so
it's supposed to actually
it's supposed to actually
um it's actually supposed to do that
um it's actually supposed to do that
itself early stopping is more for random
itself early stopping is more for random
search and such
okay I mean there's potentially more to
okay I mean there's potentially more to
do
with um cost
variance is it
working these higher cost runs aren't
working these higher cost runs aren't
trans in to better
perf I mean the ideal algorithm is going
perf I mean the ideal algorithm is going
to run a bunch of experiments at 50
mil e
yes so this does not
yes so this does not
work that's
work that's
fine we'll go back to the old one
so this should be good
okay
so maybe one more experiment
let me just go look at the parameters
let me just go look at the parameters
real
real
quick see if I can figure something
out we you total time
out we you total time
steps so 0.5 right
yeah these look fine I don't know why I
yeah these look fine I don't know why I
get stuck in weirdly weird
spots possibly needs more random trials
spots possibly needs more random trials
to be
honest that might be a decent idea
I want to make sure I'm on the right
I want to make sure I'm on the right
track at the very least
first
e
e e
oh this is still running breakout L it's
funny no wonder there's so many freaking
funny no wonder there's so many freaking
breakout results
let me make sure
uh ah good thing I caught
that
for e
okay we'll see what what this
does e
and actually we can
and actually we can
adjust total time
STS can adjust
STS can adjust
uh to time steps
we will try this for uh for PA
we shall see

good do
good do
this what's this
this what's this

it here so this is
it here so this is

128 256 okay this is a little
big I might make this the I might cut
big I might make this the I might cut
this in half go
this in half go
128 well this cuz this is look this is
128 well this cuz this is look this is
32 for
32 for
128 256 6 52 so that's getting a little
128 256 6 52 so that's getting a little
big I might do this one I could do 16
big I might do this one I could do 16
instead of

that might screw it up because it's not

you need to actually just like open this
thing like go look at this thing and
thing like go look at this thing and
make sure that this is the observation
make sure that this is the observation
that you expect
this network is
this network is
fine wait
what oh yeah Network flat and then you
what oh yeah Network flat and then you
Pudge cat Pudge this is fine and then I
Pudge cat Pudge this is fine and then I
made a a slight lstm modification to
made a a slight lstm modification to
make the input 256 um that was something
make the input 256 um that was something
that I had to do in order for it to work
that I had to do in order for it to work
yeah that's
yeah that's
fine what happened when before what like
fine what happened when before what like
it didn't work with 128 if yeah so the
it didn't work with 128 if yeah so the
default of the lstm in the if you under
default of the lstm in the if you under
recurrent is expects a 128 input so you
recurrent is expects a 128 input so you
have to make
have to make
a did you try it with 128 first or did
a did you try it with 128 first or did
you just go to
you just go to
256 well I tried to just run it without
256 well I tried to just run it without
having like the super class and then um
having like the super class and then um
well you have to change this hidden size
well you have to change this hidden size
has to be 128 if you're going to do that
has to be 128 if you're going to do that
but no okay no I haven't tried it with
but no okay no I haven't tried it with
128 I just tried it with 256 start you
128 I just tried it with 256 start you
should try you should try both if it's
should try you should try both if it's
if 128 Works it'll run faster it be
if 128 Works it'll run faster it be
better yeah so 256 it actually during
better yeah so 256 it actually during
this I tried to train some and it did
this I tried to train some and it did
start to learn so I hopefully presume
start to learn so I hopefully presume
that means that a lot of things are
that means that a lot of things are
working um well that could be the comp
working um well that could be the comp
not the 256 you know know sure but I was
not the 256 you know know sure but I was
gonna say is the speed the speed got
gonna say is the speed the speed got
tanked yeah how long is it how fast is
tanked yeah how long is it how fast is
it 560 from 1 million
it 560 from 1 million
plus oh and how big is the
plus oh and how big is the
net uh 690k parameters it's about right
net uh 690k parameters it's about right
you that's about you you made a bigger
you that's about you you made a bigger
Network what do you
Network what do you
expect well I wouldn't expect it to cut
expect well I wouldn't expect it to cut
it in half but then what do you mean you
it in half but then what do you mean you
wouldn't expect to cut it down you went
wouldn't expect to cut it down you went
from 150k parameters to 600k like
from 150k parameters to 600k like
because if it's it's basically like
because if it's it's basically like
mostly Network that's taking up the time
mostly Network that's taking up the time
so I suppose it should be yeah my n is
so I suppose it should be yeah my n is
0% every everything is in train yes that
0% every everything is in train yes that
was yeah so the Net's a little big as
was yeah so the Net's a little big as
all okay so secondary question here
all okay so secondary question here
expensive
expensive
I mean this is pretty much hardcoded for
I mean this is pretty much hardcoded for
level one how would you recommend I set
level one how would you recommend I set
it up to do Dynamic based off of the the
it up to do Dynamic based off of the the
level sizes the level sizes changed from
level sizes the level sizes changed from
level to level like it won't necessarily
level to level like it won't necessarily
always be a 6X 6 by8 it could
always be a 6X 6 by8 it could
potentially Global Ops you do local Ops
potentially Global Ops you do local Ops
you give it you give it a 3D crop around
you give it you give it a 3D crop around
the uh around the
the uh around the
player okay so just do some like some
player okay so just do some like some
reasonable crop um up to yeah you're
reasonable crop um up to yeah you're
going to have to play around with how
going to have to play around with how
big how far you need to see you should
big how far you need to see you should
probably just figure out like if you
probably just figure out like if you
play the game how far you need to see in
play the game how far you need to see in
order to actually still play it so a
order to actually still play it so a
little tradeoff there so so here's kind
little tradeoff there so so here's kind
of like a slightly weird part right cuz
of like a slightly weird part right cuz
like if when you're playing the actual
like if when you're playing the actual
game like visually you can
game like visually you can
determine I guess some degree of depth
determine I guess some degree of depth
uh when you're looking at it m i mean
uh when you're looking at it m i mean
you for sure need to see like the full
you for sure need to see like the full
width of the
width of the
screen and
screen and
then I mean you can argue that you don't
then I mean you can argue that you don't
need to see entirely up but I guess up
need to see entirely up but I guess up
in the game you don't even you don't see
in the game you don't even you don't see
the whole thing in the game the camera's
the whole thing in the game the camera's
kind of zoomed in in in the puzzle mode
kind of zoomed in in in the puzzle mode
of which this is kind of extracting some
of which this is kind of extracting some
levels from you can for the mo you can
levels from you can for the mo you can
see pretty close but I I get what you
see pretty close but I I get what you
mean I'll make a window that seems
mean I'll make a window that seems
pretty reasonable and then probably like
pretty reasonable and then probably like
I don't know five maybe seven by seven
I don't know five maybe seven by seven
by whatever yeah and sure and so instead
by whatever yeah and sure and so instead
of having it centered on player I I
of having it centered on player I I
would presume I'd Center it like maybe
would presume I'd Center it like maybe
one like two above player because you
one like two above player because you
really don't need to look at below you
really don't need to look at below you
realistically you can do
realistically you can do
that and that's all that would all be
that and that's all that would all be
within the N logic right that during
within the N logic right that during
that well it's within it's all in
that well it's within it's all in
compute observations as all yeah yeah
compute observations as all yeah yeah
yeah yeah okay so I could do that and
yeah yeah okay so I could do that and
then run a fresh sweep n nuke all like
then run a fresh sweep n nuke all like
the previously kind of somewhat
the previously kind of somewhat
understood parameters because now we're
understood parameters because now we're
on a 3D con
on a 3D con
you can keep your parameters and then
you can keep your parameters and then
what you do is you make the graphs in
what you do is you make the graphs in
the dashboard and you see if the best
the dashboard and you see if the best
runs are at the edge of any of your
runs are at the edge of any of your
ranges and if they're at the edge of
ranges and if they're at the edge of
your range then you have to expand the
range okay you know what I mean that I
range okay you know what I mean that I
mean I presume if like all of the
mean I presume if like all of the
parameters are it's shooting for are all
parameters are it's shooting for are all
like you know say if it's I set a range
like you know say if it's I set a range
from 09 to 0.95 and all them are at 094
from 09 to 0.95 and all them are at 094
999 then expand it
999 then expand it
so I can do that from an early test I
so I can do that from an early test I
did notice that it was able to achieve a
did notice that it was able to achieve a
higher score in a much quicker time
higher score in a much quicker time
frame but it has not been able to beat
frame but it has not been able to beat
the game
the game
yet it has not been able to what you are
yet it has not been able to what you are
far away and
far away and
quiet yeah the local Ops crop might
quiet yeah the local Ops crop might
actually help
you what I one thing that I was thinking
you what I one thing that I was thinking
about in terms of like a reward
about in terms of like a reward
engineering thing and you know was
what if I rewarded it for various
what if I rewarded it for various
patterns that like the game shows you as
patterns that like the game shows you as
like useful techniques instead of just
like useful techniques instead of just
like the most basic like saying like you
like the most basic like saying like you
get rewarded for going up and you get
get rewarded for going up and you get
penalized for going down yeah probably
penalized for going down yeah probably
too complicated to be honest I wouldn't
too complicated to be honest I wouldn't
bother I wouldn't bothering that much I
bother I wouldn't bothering that much I
think you'll just I think you'll just
think you'll just I think you'll just
get it you if you want to spend time on
get it you if you want to spend time on
anything you might do like the random
anything you might do like the random
level stuff that' probably be fun for
level stuff that' probably be fun for
you sure
you sure
I reward ship for weeks is just not fun
I reward ship for weeks is just not fun
or
or
useful yeah I mean I at least want to
useful yeah I mean I at least want to
see if I can get this to beat at least
see if I can get this to beat at least
the first level pretty cleanly easily
the first level pretty cleanly easily
and get there see how well it does on
and get there see how well it does on
maybe like two or three levels and then
maybe like two or three levels and then
I'll mess with the PG stuff where you
I'll mess with the PG stuff where you
just like dunk in like
just like dunk in like
10,000 hopefully this this sweep stuff
10,000 hopefully this this sweep stuff
is better we'll
see oh kind these sces aren't great yet
see oh kind these sces aren't great yet
but also i' I've set it to like really
but also i' I've set it to like really
fast runs only it's trying to build up a
fast runs only it's trying to build up a
predictive model at the moment I don't
predictive model at the moment I don't
know about these batch
know about these batch
sizes or these mini
batches we'll see what it's doing
batches we'll see what it's doing
here yeah I guess I see what you mean
here yeah I guess I see what you mean
when I asked you a couple days ago to
when I asked you a couple days ago to
and you're like yeah don't worry too
and you're like yeah don't worry too
much about the policy stuff because it's
much about the policy stuff because it's
like you mentioned it's like not very
like you mentioned it's like not very
complicated really not right to set up
complicated really not right to set up
this one I mean I think I only spent
this one I mean I think I only spent
like an hour or two kind of messing with
like an hour or two kind of messing with
it and then really not that was start
it and then really not that was start
training it'll be less than an hour or
training it'll be less than an hour or
two once you get better it would take
two once you get better it would take
you 20
you 20
minutes
minutes
sure we'll
see so did you see the carb stuff I've
see so did you see the carb stuff I've
been
been
doing I haven't been able to really
doing I haven't been able to really
follow it throughout today so um what
follow it throughout today so um what
kind of I know you said you're like
kind of I know you said you're like
redoing the math but can you dive like a
redoing the math but can you dive like a
little bit as an explanation or catch me
little bit as an explanation or catch me
up a little bit Yeah so is this thir
up a little bit Yeah so is this thir
good one yeah so this
good one yeah so this
is basically a full solve of a synthetic
is basically a full solve of a synthetic
hyper parameter tuning task with the
hyper parameter tuning task with the
cleanest the cleanest progress curve
cleanest the cleanest progress curve
you've ever seen on a hyper parameter
you've ever seen on a hyper parameter
sweep yeah I mean it looks pretty nasty
sweep yeah I mean it looks pretty nasty
to
to
me that like typically it's just like
me that like typically it's just like
all over the freaking place so these are
all over the freaking place so these are
this is like consistent
this is like consistent
Improvement these points here these are
Improvement these points here these are
resampled points these are resampled
resampled points these are resampled
parito optimal points so it's basically
parito optimal points so it's basically
it's checking its
it's checking its
work um this is look different from like
work um this is look different from like
the curves that I have it starts right
the curves that I have it starts right
here you can see it starts off with
here you can see it starts off with
really fast runs and then it gets
really fast runs and then it gets
confident and it just very quickly goes
confident and it just very quickly goes
to very long runs cuz in this case
to very long runs cuz in this case
that's what gives you perf so you see
that's what gives you perf so you see
right around here it gets this last perf
right around here it gets this last perf
bump yeah um it's got you know hyper
bump yeah um it's got you know hyper
prems very latched on very quickly the
prems very latched on very quickly the
optimal there are a couple small quirks
optimal there are a couple small quirks
where it doesn't get everything quite
where it doesn't get everything quite
perfect like Lambda for instance for
perfect like Lambda for instance for
some reason it has Lambda too high up
some reason it has Lambda too high up
until the very end um but it pretty much
until the very end um but it pretty much
just gets everything very quickly with a
just gets everything very quickly with a
few small
exceptions and this is the Pito front
exceptions and this is the Pito front
you can see there like a few misses but
you can see there like a few misses but
out of 200 runs it's basically a perfect
out of 200 runs it's basically a perfect
parito front with a few like a few
parito front with a few like a few
misses over
misses over
here
here
um so
um so
yeah
yeah
so on
so on
a go forward basis when I'm kind of
a go forward basis when I'm kind of
working more on the science side stuff
working more on the science side stuff
the stuff I did today would be
the stuff I did today would be
absolutely hard as [ __ ] this took every
absolutely hard as [ __ ] this took every
this took like most of what I knew um
this took like most of what I knew um
understood this is to give you an idea
understood this is to give you an idea
the carbs hyper pram sweep algorithm has
the carbs hyper pram sweep algorithm has
three different gaussian processes that
three different gaussian processes that
are used for various things uh it has
are used for various things uh it has
several probabilistic reings and several
several probabilistic reings and several
kind of weird uh space Transformations
kind of weird uh space Transformations
for various types of parameters and
for various types of parameters and
2,000 lines of code that probably should
2,000 lines of code that probably should
be around 700 lines of code um so I
be around 700 lines of code um so I
redesigned like half of the math on this
redesigned like half of the math on this
algorithm based off of just like staring
algorithm based off of just like staring
through the paper for a very long time
through the paper for a very long time
sure I first of all I fixed their space
sure I first of all I fixed their space
Transformations that was kind of the
Transformations that was kind of the
initial thing that got me
initial thing that got me
started I a lot of their mask a lot of
started I a lot of their mask a lot of
their like their candidate sample
their like their candidate sample
filtering I replaced with clam
filtering I replaced with clam
I got rid of this search term entirely
I got rid of this search term entirely
based off of some analysis I did
based off of some analysis I did
I completely changed this acquisition
I completely changed this acquisition
function clamping thing I replaced this
function clamping thing I replaced this
with a a completely different
with a a completely different
function and there were a few other
function and there were a few other
changes as
changes as
well so yeah like this is a whole new
well so yeah like this is a whole new
algorithm at this
algorithm at this
point um
point um
it works we'll see whether we'll see how
it works we'll see whether we'll see how
well it transfers to the real RL tasks
well it transfers to the real RL tasks
but the original algorithm fails a very
but the original algorithm fails a very
basic synthetic task and the uh the new
basic synthetic task and the uh the new
one crushes it uh why would it fail a
one crushes it uh why would it fail a
basic task there are lots of issues with
basic task there are lots of issues with
the
algorithm and if you look at this so if
algorithm and if you look at this so if
you look at this here's the thing that
you look at this here's the thing that
doesn't make sense right they say that
doesn't make sense right they say that
this is like really good in this Crush
this is like really good in this Crush
has all these benchmarks but if you look
has all these benchmarks but if you look
at the
at the
RL all these different algorithms
RL all these different algorithms
including carbs lose to Asha as's a
including carbs lose to Asha as's a
really [ __ ]
really [ __ ]
algorithm that's what the sh stands
algorithm that's what the sh stands
for no it's um it's basically Asha Asha
for no it's um it's basically Asha Asha
is literally just a random search with
is literally just a random search with
adaptive compute so like you can get an
adaptive compute so like you can get an
upper you can do like an upper bound on
upper you can do like an upper bound on
Asha just by doing like the number of
Asha just by doing like the number of
Random sech trials that Asha is going to
Random sech trials that Asha is going to
do for the full number of time
do for the full number of time
steps so like is hebo any good or is
steps so like is hebo any good or is
that like yeah hebo is good but carbs is
that like yeah hebo is good but carbs is
built on hebo so carbs should be better
built on hebo so carbs should be better
than hebo okay lower is better here so
than hebo okay lower is better here so
carbs is better carbs is better and then
carbs is better carbs is better and then
carbs is better so so those these they
carbs is better so so those these they
don't have they don't have the uh GitHub
don't have they don't have the uh GitHub
for like the the testing do they they
for like the the testing do they they
don't have that code available they sent
don't have that code available they sent
me some of it but the thing is it's
me some of it but the thing is it's
really slow they ran this like at
really slow they ran this like at
massive scale yeah I bet it yeah
massive scale yeah I bet it yeah
exactly so but the thing is because they
exactly so but the thing is because they
ran this at massive scale look all of
ran this at massive scale look all of
their experiments were at like at least
their experiments were at like at least
a 100 times slower than ours actually
a 100 times slower than ours actually
like a thousand times slower for a lot
like a thousand times slower for a lot
of them so my expectation is even though
of them so my expectation is even though
they have a fair number of gpus we're
they have a fair number of gpus we're
actually going to run more experiments
actually going to run more experiments
than they are on like two gpus because
than they are on like two gpus because
our stuff is so fast which is kind of
our stuff is so fast which is kind of
cool right
cool right
well it makes sense to uh some which
well it makes sense to uh some which
means we get better results right we
means we get better results right we
we're able to actually test it
we're able to actually test it
properly which which things can't we
properly which which things can't we
test on
test on
there oh all the tasks they use are
there oh all the tasks they use are
slow are there any things that that that
slow are there any things that that that
are not going to be testable using the
are not going to be testable using the
using
using
a uh puffer native environment no we
a uh puffer native environment no we
we'll just test like puffer native
we'll just test like puffer native
versus original carbs and we'll be good
versus original carbs and we'll be good
so so those those particular it doesn't
so so those those particular it doesn't
matter to test on those particular tests
matter to test on those particular tests
that they've tested on no they just ch
that they've tested on no they just ch
some like they just chose some standard
some like they just chose some standard
RL Tas that run 5,000 steps a
RL Tas that run 5,000 steps a
second
second
H doesn't matter at
H doesn't matter at
all it would be nice to have direct
all it would be nice to have direct
comparison we'll just Test original
comparison we'll just Test original
carbs on our environments right yeah
carbs on our environments right yeah
yeah you
yeah you
can it doesn't matter
can it doesn't matter
but well it's potentially maybe
but well it's potentially maybe
application specific
yeah it
yeah it
n well again look this is these are
n well again look this is these are
these are still very short runs this is
these are still very short runs this is
pong is uh without frame Skip and we're
pong is uh without frame Skip and we're
only doing like this is was 14 million
only doing like this is was 14 million
or whatever so 69 runs let's go we'll
or whatever so 69 runs let's go we'll
see if it does in 200 if not I'll up the
see if it does in 200 if not I'll up the
budget a little bit Y is this the exact
budget a little bit Y is this the exact
same setting that you were just using
same setting that you were just using
for yeah okay same setting minus the
for yeah okay same setting minus the
different total time step config and
different total time step config and
then breakout has a larger budget
then breakout has a larger budget
because breakout takes longer so we'll
because breakout takes longer so we'll
see we'll see how this does it's a
see we'll see how this does it's a
little iffy because some of these tasks
little iffy because some of these tasks
are very like seed dependent and stuff
are very like seed dependent and stuff
so we'll see how it does on these but
so we'll see how it does on these but
should be
should be
interesting linky am I am I like totally
interesting linky am I am I like totally
missing that there's a bunch of
missing that there's a bunch of
complicated stuff I'm not anticipating
complicated stuff I'm not anticipating
with a
with a
cluster linky talk please
[Applause]
[Applause]
um wor sorry sorry my my kid's going to
um wor sorry sorry my my kid's going to
be loud um but the worry is
be loud um but the worry is
scale yeah
scale yeah
honestly because look at all the little
honestly because look at all the little
problems you're having with like six
problems you're having with like six
boxes well the main problem having six
boxes well the main problem having six
boxes is microne to be
boxes is microne to be
fair
fair
um I wouldn't say fully
um I wouldn't say fully
100% I mean changes by the way they're
100% I mean changes by the way they're
all going to be air cooled so we're not
all going to be air cooled so we're not
going to have to deal with broken water
going to have to deal with broken water
coolers that's good that's probably good
coolers that's good that's probably good
when you have that many machines
when you have that many machines
honestly
um yeah
um yeah
desktops really layout's going to be a
desktops really layout's going to be a
pain you're going to have to figure that
pain you're going to have to figure that
out it's just along one
out it's just along one
wall yeah but you're also going to have
wall yeah but you're also going to have
to verify on every box that your air is
to verify on every box that your air is
Flowing the correct way and you want to
Flowing the correct way and you want to
split it into a
split it into a
hot he said he said a guy's going to do
hot he said he said a guy's going to do
that I I think we should be I mean we're
that I I think we should be I mean we're
going to we have like we'll have pretty
going to we have like we'll have pretty
good AC in there and
ventilation it doesn't matter I mean
ventilation it doesn't matter I mean
imagine if you have every band pointing
imagine if you have every band pointing
in the same direction and you just have
in the same direction and you just have
a row of boxes down the center of the
room you need you need to have a a like
room you need you need to have a a like
probably a air flow that's that's
probably a air flow that's that's
sweeping the the hot the hot air away
sweeping the the hot the hot air away
and cooler air that's flowing in through
and cooler air that's flowing in through
the front you're going to have enough
the front you're going to have enough
bans in enough boxes in there to
bans in enough boxes in there to
actually affect the total room current
actually affect the total room current
like air
like air
circulation keep that in mind where dep
circulation keep that in mind where dep
what I will go I will go through it and
what I will go I will go through it and
look at the the layout suggested um also
look at the the layout suggested um also
think about Network
think about Network
redundancy um I could get a backup with
redundancy um I could get a backup with
stlink if we need
stlink if we need
it I think that's a good idea uh I don't
it I think that's a good idea uh I don't
the one thing is I don't know if we can
the one thing is I don't know if we can
get 10 gigabit there because it's like
get 10 gigabit there because it's like
it's on a far so I don't know if we can
it's on a far so I don't know if we can
get like 10 gigabit to to there or if
get like 10 gigabit to to there or if
it's going to be one we'll
it's going to be one we'll
see here's the thing like do you
imagine gig do you imagine gigabytes
imagine gig do you imagine gigabytes
going through through it and short
going through through it and short
amount of time like we might just put
amount of time like we might just put
some monitoring on there and yell at
some monitoring on there and yell at
anybody that's doing too much
anybody that's doing too much
logging well yeah there is that I think
logging well yeah there is that I think
that's smart but then it might even be
that's smart but then it might even be
wise to say how about you look at a
wise to say how about you look at a
network attached storage for all of them
network attached storage for all of them
and just partition that off to each
and just partition that off to each
machine and I really don't want to do I
machine and I really don't want to do I
really don't want to do shared file
really don't want to do shared file
system for these machines it's a pain in
system for these machines it's a pain in
the ass
the ass
uh that's fine I was going to say uh
uh that's fine I was going to say uh
you're going to have to set up logging
you're going to have to set up logging
on each individual machine oh no so for
on each individual machine oh no so for
that we'll
that we'll

everything you can automate that all you
everything you can automate that all you
want really what I mean
is first of all setting up a log server

right so here's
right so here's
a I just imagine a world where I have a

lean key at puffer box and then there's
lean key at puffer box and then there's
a simple way to do that I just it's
a simple way to do that I just it's
annoying because then you have to go
annoying because then you have to go
into each box you're going to assign
into each box you're going to assign
people and add them like add users or
people and add them like add users or
whatever which is kind of
whatever which is kind of
obnoxious no you have groups assigned
obnoxious no you have groups assigned
you have boxes assigned to groups and
you have boxes assigned to groups and
then users assigned to groups and only
then users assigned to groups and only

use those subset of

world where I go okay I was on puffer
world where I go okay I was on puffer
box too but now I'm lean key logging

like way on the other side it's like way
on the far wall it'll be
fine what happened with uh Intel in the
fine what happened with uh Intel in the
cluster curious they shipped two
cluster curious they shipped two
consecutive generations of broken ships
consecutive generations of broken ships
that just s
that just s
fault
oh that sounds bad yes yes it is very
oh that sounds bad yes yes it is very
bad to ship two generations of
bad to ship two generations of
consecutive broken
ships I'm a little confused
ships I'm a little confused
why this thing is so damn confident
I guess it's because I'm penalizing it
I guess it's because I'm penalizing it
from
doing I'm kind of penalizing it
for not having confident predictions
huh I might have to look at that there
huh I might have to look at that there
might have to be a better Suite of
might have to be a better Suite of
synthetic benchmarks
synthetic benchmarks
we'll see just annoying because carbs is
we'll see just annoying because carbs is
actually not that fast to run it takes a
actually not that fast to run it takes a
few seconds for
prediction stuff to optimize
GMA
L really hasn't explored very much
a
start I'm trying to think if I shouldn't
start I'm trying to think if I shouldn't
be
be
penalizing there's a local Improvement
penalizing there's a local Improvement
term and then there's a global
term and then there's a global
Improvement
term they're both at the moment they're
term they're both at the moment they're
conservative meaning that they're
conservative meaning that they're
subtracting their uncertainty from their
subtracting their uncertainty from their
prediction but maybe I should only be
prediction but maybe I should only be
penalizing uncertainty on the global
scale which would then allow it a little
scale which would then allow it a little
bit more freedom to explore on the lower
end cuz it's like it's too scared to
end cuz it's like it's too scared to
explore
or it's like too scared to explore
or it's like too scared to explore
certain hyper
parameters like this is not
amazing we'll see what this did you ever
amazing we'll see what this did you ever
see that uh like hyper parameter fral GI
see that uh like hyper parameter fral GI
and let me see if I can find it the PB
and let me see if I can find it the PB
BT or
BT or
something
something
it's it always made me a little bit
it's it always made me a little bit
afraid of hyper
afraid of hyper
like well trying to understand hyper
like well trying to understand hyper
parameters um oh I think I I think I
parameters um oh I think I I think I
know it's yeah the weird thing where
know it's yeah the weird thing where
it's like so
sensitive me see
can put it in uh in general if you want
can put it in uh in general if you want
to see
it it's like there's a pretty clear
it it's like there's a pretty clear
boundary at like the little the macro
boundary at like the little the macro
scale of like but then if you zoom in on
scale of like but then if you zoom in on
the hyper parameters it's just sort of
the hyper parameters it's just sort of
like an
like an
infinitely weird like it's like a
infinitely weird like it's like a
fractal right
funny we just Tred to hyper parameter go
funny we just Tred to hyper parameter go
bar yeah
bar yeah
oh although you know I guess it's
oh although you know I guess it's
important to know that what they're
important to know that what they're
zooming on on there is like a boundary
zooming on on there is like a boundary
right it's so maybe you don't you know
right it's so maybe you don't you know
you hopefully you're not like exactly in
you hopefully you're not like exactly in
a boundary between not working and
a boundary between not working and
working
oh
this yeah I've heard this I've seen
this I
think remind me not to go to SF
um I think I'm going to probably cue One
um I think I'm going to probably cue One
new
new
new one on this then go to sleep at
new one on this then go to sleep at
tomorrow I might do the micro code at
tomorrow I might do the micro code at
least tomorrow we'll see a layout the

gym order that
gym order that
equipment set up the payment
equipment set up the payment
for prototype machine and a couple other
for prototype machine and a couple other
small things the goal for next week so
small things the goal for next week so
there going to be some academic collabs
there going to be some academic collabs
there's some client work and then I I
there's some client work and then I I
really want this hyper parameter thing
really want this hyper parameter thing
to be like the first major science side
to be like the first major science side
thing that we get working
thing that we get working
solidly
solidly
um the goal is that when you launch
um the goal is that when you launch
experiments right when you launch a
experiments right when you launch a
hyper parameter sweep you should be
hyper parameter sweep you should be
pretty damn confident that it's found
pretty damn confident that it's found
your best hyper parameters like you
your best hyper parameters like you
should be confident that the issue is
should be confident that the issue is
not hyper parameters after running a
not hyper parameters after running a
sweep so you know whatever result you
sweep so you know whatever result you
get you're getting the best the best
get you're getting the best the best
hyper parameters you can find that's the
hyper parameters you can find that's the
best version that you're getting with
best version that you're getting with
the current algorithm architecture
the current algorithm architecture
Etc because right now there's this huge
Etc because right now there's this huge
amount of sensitivity the hyper
amount of sensitivity the hyper
parameters and like it almost doesn't
parameters and like it almost doesn't
matter what your architectural algorithm
matter what your architectural algorithm
are because you still have no idea
are because you still have no idea
whether it's good or not because of the
whether it's good or not because of the
stupid hyper parameter
sensitivity yeah that that definitely
sensitivity yeah that that definitely
makes a lot of
makes a lot of
sense that's I think this is like the
sense that's I think this is like the
biggest bang for your buck first problem
biggest bang for your buck first problem
to look at it's kind of a hard
to look at it's kind of a hard
problem and I I like I wish that I like
problem and I I like I wish that I like
one of the baselines would be better
one of the baselines would be better
like I looked at Asha but it's
like I looked at Asha but it's
really it can't be as good as it's shown
really it can't be as good as it's shown
in the paper because it just can't
in the paper because it just can't
fundamentally based on what it is um so
fundamentally based on what it is um so
I think that just
I think that just
like I think a lot of these hyperr
like I think a lot of these hyperr
baselines are just weaker than they
baselines are just weaker than they
should be
because they're just not tuned correctly
because they're just not tuned correctly
I don't know what to say like they they
I don't know what to say like they they
have weird decisions and they're not set
have weird decisions and they're not set
up correctly um yeah it's kind of weird
up correctly um yeah it's kind of weird
that like outperforms hebo and stuff but
that like outperforms hebo and stuff but
like I guess for RL they're like they
like I guess for RL they're like they
kind of did some additional
kind of did some additional
considerations on hebo but then there's
considerations on hebo but then there's
still some like some bugs and errors and
still some like some bugs and errors and
stuff I know when you see 2,000 lines of
stuff I know when you see 2,000 lines of
code that wether should be 700 you kind
code that wether should be 700 you kind
of know some stuff's going to be dranky
of know some stuff's going to be dranky
and
and
broken so
broken so
I probably should just make a better
I probably should just make a better
synthetic test and get better local
synthetic test and get better local
logging for them
logging for them
um and then figure out if I can speed up
um and then figure out if I can speed up
carbs because it just takes too long to
carbs because it just takes too long to
run the damn thing on a test like really
run the damn thing on a test like really
you want like if you to run random
you want like if you to run random
search it runs instantly and you just
search it runs instantly and you just
get your experiment feedback
get your experiment feedback
instantly
instantly
um
um
yeah random search is not a terrible
yeah random search is not a terrible
Baseline actually actually with the way
Baseline actually actually with the way
that we've implemented it now
so we will
so we will
see how's this
going is it really just not that
good something is wrong
maybe well yeah I mean looking at it
maybe well yeah I mean looking at it
it's just it's scared to do anything
I I can just
I I can just
like mess with
the I can just like mess with the scal
the I can just like mess with the scal
of
of
stuff and try again
pong is a decent one cuz pong probably
pong is a decent one cuz pong probably
it only takes like an hour to
it only takes like an hour to
run and it's like a real like it's a

week I did I got GPU drive from 35k up

tomorrow I did an initial integration of
tomorrow I did an initial integration of
um intersection Zoo which is this
um intersection Zoo which is this
traffic control end for MIT we'll see
traffic control end for MIT we'll see
how they like that uh I got to go back
how they like that uh I got to go back
and forth with them that took quite a

bit of work I did Isaac gym integration
bit of work I did Isaac gym integration
for a client that uh that seems to be

decently I got uh this a lot of hyper
decently I got uh this a lot of hyper
parameter sweet stuff done in puffer
parameter sweet stuff done in puffer
that's what I've been doing on science
that's what I've been doing on science
side so far and I reviewed several
side so far and I reviewed several
thousand lines of code from
thousand lines of code from
contributors out of
contributors out of
curiosity sorry
curiosity sorry
continue yeah um do you do like contract
continue yeah um do you do like contract
integration yeah it's like it's right on
integration yeah it's like it's right on
the website
the website
right well no I mean like so if let's
right well no I mean like so if let's
say I had a company and I was like ah
say I had a company and I was like ah
cool puffer lib up and coming great
cool puffer lib up and coming great
let's let's give this a world it seems
let's let's give this a world it seems
like a perfect fit can they hire you as
like a perfect fit can they hire you as
like contract to rework it for their
like contract to rework it for their
purposes and basically basically the
purposes and basically basically the
farther you take us away from the agenda
farther you take us away from the agenda
of what we're doing with puffer the more
of what we're doing with puffer the more
we
we
charge so yeah the base service package
charge so yeah the base service package
is for you have you want to use puffer
is for you have you want to use puffer
lib you're going to need a few things of
lib you're going to need a few things of
integration and you need us to like rep
integration and you need us to like rep
prioritize a couple features from 6
prioritize a couple features from 6
months from now up to next week that's
months from now up to next week that's
like the type of stuff the base package
like the type of stuff the base package
is for right extended support
is for right extended support
reprioritization of features a little
reprioritization of features a little
bit of
bit of
integration um know if you have
integration um know if you have
something that's like substantially
something that's like substantially
farther away from that that's like you
farther away from that that's like you
know farther from what we would be doing
know farther from what we would be doing
anyways we still help with it but you
anyways we still help with it but you
know we're going to charge cuz we're not
know we're going to charge cuz we're not
getting the code back to puffer lib
getting the code back to puffer lib
right CU that's like a lot of the
right CU that's like a lot of the
benefit is we continue to build out
benefit is we continue to build out
puffer so they the compass to be higher
puffer so they the compass to be higher
so the base like the base packages from
so the base like the base packages from
puffer are 10K for support and all the
puffer are 10K for support and all the
stuff that I do and then it goes up from
there what are your thoughts on and I'm
there what are your thoughts on and I'm
this
this
is purely hypotheticals because I don't
is purely hypotheticals because I don't
I'm I'm just asking to
I'm I'm just asking to

um if you had to rework some of puffer
um if you had to rework some of puffer
lib to meet a company's agenda and they

had agreed on whatever price both of you
had agreed on whatever price both of you
deemed

is technically the company's property

handle those Niche the niche situations
handle those Niche the niche situations
to say that like my Project's open

puffer lip right it's going to stay open
puffer lip right it's going to stay open

you want it to be open source because it

don't have to deal with it and it gets

whatnot right so really the only thing
whatnot right so really the only thing
that uh clients should even want is the

specific stuff which aren't useful to
specific stuff which aren't useful to
puffer Li so sure you can keep those but
puffer Li so sure you can keep those but
again it's like the more work that we
again it's like the more work that we
have to spend our time doing on that
have to spend our time doing on that
side the more the base price is going to

go up thus far most of what we're doing
go up thus far most of what we're doing
for clients is pretty darn close to what
for clients is pretty darn close to what
we want to do anyways with puffer just
we want to do anyways with puffer just
you know reprioritized in time frame and
you know reprioritized in time frame and
we're mostly looking for clients to do
we're mostly looking for clients to do
that at the moment um bigger contracts
that at the moment um bigger contracts
will come later but the thing is like by
will come later but the thing is like by
the time we get to later right puffer is
the time we get to later right puffer is
going to be larger and we'll probably
going to be larger and we'll probably
just cover a lot of the things that
just cover a lot of the things that
people are going to want anyways like by
people are going to want anyways like by
the time we have really good hyper cram

okay let's look at our experiments first
okay let's look at our experiments first
this seems like it actually kind of did
this seems like it actually kind of did
something
something
um
um
oops this seems like it actually kind of
oops this seems like it actually kind of
did something which I'm
did something which I'm
surprised cuz I thought that this was
surprised cuz I thought that this was
really stupid
really stupid
um Okay so
so see so this is the one from
so see so this is the one from
before this goes up
before this goes up
to 28 2900 so this doesn't quite get
to 28 2900 so this doesn't quite get
there um and it gets up to like here on
there um and it gets up to like here on
the total time
the total time
steps and then if we look at this
one
one
interesting so this is still a very
interesting so this is still a very
clean set of
clean set of
Curves um and actually the time steps
Curves um and actually the time steps
are nice too it's got these like two
are nice too it's got these like two
Divergent paths which is a little
Divergent paths which is a little
weird but it's not it's not doing as
weird but it's not it's not doing as
well
well
overall let's see
overall let's see
why this is like a very
tight this is very interesting
tight this is very interesting
um I didn't expect this out the
gate this is almost tighter than the
gate this is almost tighter than the
other one and this is
like this is more the shape that we want
like this is more the shape that we want
as well where it's like a very quick

a little weird but you know
a little weird but you know

whatever um
so batch size is correct mini batches
so batch size is correct mini batches

doesn't go to eight okay this gets stuck

should be higher then cost is scaled

nicely whoa oh what the
nicely whoa oh what the
heck double parito
heck double parito
front very
front very
clean but then this doesn't make
clean but then this doesn't make
sense you
see this is like beautifully clean and
see this is like beautifully clean and
then this one this portion is fine but
then this one this portion is fine but
then what is this
right so it's got to be a quirk of the
right so it's got to be a quirk of the
function
function
now I didn't think it was a great
now I didn't think it was a great
function but I don't know why it does
function but I don't know why it does
this
this
specifically
specifically
um let me
um let me
see so this is what we did and I added a
see so this is what we did and I added a
bias to this Improvement term as well
bias to this Improvement term as well
the
bias the bias should just make it non-
bias the bias should just make it non-
negative it's a big bias but that
negative it's a big bias but that
shouldn't
shouldn't
matter so I did Improvement Plus let me
matter so I did Improvement Plus let me
make sure this is right
make sure this is right
yeah so here's the Improvement Plus 100
yeah so here's the Improvement Plus 100
this is
this is
conservative Improvement and then we
conservative Improvement and then we
have conservative
have conservative
absolute and then the thing that I
absolute and then the thing that I
changed here other than this bias was
changed here other than this bias was
that I added or I divided by the cost
estimate so how does this
estimate so how does this
how does this
work not this one where'd it
work not this one where'd it
go so I divided by the cost estimate
so this is 12338 down
so this is 12338 down
here this is a low cost
it's low cost but like it's not
Paro so why does this get
suggested this is bizarre I sure I don't
suggested this is bizarre I sure I don't
have like multiple
336 you know these are from the
336 you know these are from the
same the same runs
same the same runs
right this
right this
three four yeah and here it's like
three four yeah and here it's like
42 this is very very weird
[Music]
[Music]
it's not sampling points on the
Curve
e e
lower cost
points I want to do
next I don't know why this gets stuck
genuinely welcome YouTube folks this is
genuinely welcome YouTube folks this is
Redevelopment of a hyperparameter tuning
Redevelopment of a hyperparameter tuning
algorithm and we're we've got something
algorithm and we're we've got something
that's really good on the synthetic test
that's really good on the synthetic test
but it's just there are a couple last
but it's just there are a couple last
things that I'm not satisfied with yet
things that I'm not satisfied with yet
and uh one of them is the way that it
and uh one of them is the way that it
scales to a longer and longer
scales to a longer and longer
experiments over time
me do this first just to make sure that
me do this first just to make sure that
I'm not totally
trolling it's Bizarro
let me think in the meantime if I can
let me think in the meantime if I can
figure out what this
does oh
does oh
also not cover the
chat yeah this
decent um
acquisition
acquisition
value so Improvement gives
you uniform
you uniform
sampling across the Paro
front right and it's just wherever you
front right and it's just wherever you
can improve the Paro
can improve the Paro
front
now this is annoying because if you have
now this is annoying because if you have
a perfect estimate of the Paro front
a perfect estimate of the Paro front
uh it doesn't mean you can't sample but
uh it doesn't mean you can't sample but
it gives it turns into uniform
it gives it turns into uniform
sampling right so if you have a perfect
sampling right so if you have a perfect
estimate of the Paro front you uniformly
estimate of the Paro front you uniformly
sample around existing parito
points you don't bias towards longer
points you don't bias towards longer
experiments so the goal
is as you get more
is as you get more
confident which generally means that
confident which generally means that
there are fewer places where you improve
there are fewer places where you improve
an expectation that's fine okay so it's
an expectation that's fine okay so it's
it's off of the parito curve fit
it's off of the parito curve fit
really all the sampling is done off the
really all the sampling is done off the
Pito curve fit it's not done off of your
Pito curve fit it's not done off of your
existing experiments
existing experiments
so let's say that you learn a good curve
so let's say that you learn a good curve
bit off of the quicker
bit off of the quicker
runs
runs
okay then
okay then
what so Improvement
what so Improvement
[Music]
[Music]
becomes let's say a
becomes let's say a
uniform it goes to zero really but we're
uniform it goes to zero really but we're
going to add a bias to that so let's say
going to add a bias to that so let's say
it's just
it's just
uniform okay so now you want to
uniform okay so now you want to
bias towards higher
bias towards higher
cost no you don't want to bias towards
cost no you don't want to bias towards
higher cost you want to bias towards
higher cost you want to bias towards
higher performance which can be higher
higher performance which can be higher
cost so absolute performance term does
cost so absolute performance term does
that already without doing the divide by
cost I remember not liking that for some
cost I remember not liking that for some
reason
though and the reason is if you have
like if you have uncertainty across the
like if you have uncertainty across the
whole
whole
front then this can bias you towards
front then this can bias you towards
high
high
cost the thing that you're trying to
cost the thing that you're trying to
express here right is you want to move
express here right is you want to move
towards higher performance as you become
towards higher performance as you become
certain you want to move away from high
certain you want to move away from high
cost as you're
uncertain well wait you always want to
uncertain well wait you always want to
go towards higher
go towards higher
performance and away from high cost
performance and away from high cost
unless you're certain
I don't know about this divide by cost
function
e e
this is
tricky okay so your base is going to
be I don't know about this
either your base acquisition
either your base acquisition
function it's Improvement times absolute
performance and that seems
like that seems
good and then there should be a cost
good and then there should be a cost
penalty
that reduces with modal
confidence is that
confidence is that
good so model uncertainty we have that's
good so model uncertainty we have that's
just just the variance in the cost
just just the variance in the cost
prediction
I don't think this cost penalty term is
I don't think this cost penalty term is
well
formulated does this even make sense
formulated does this even make sense
what this is trying to do
I mean you're probably pretty damn
I mean you're probably pretty damn
accurate on the cost of stuff it's
accurate on the cost of stuff it's
really easy to predict that
does this bias really screw screwing up
does this bias really screw screwing up
the
algorithm that'd be
algorithm that'd be
weird
weird
right 50 this looks like it could be or
right 50 this looks like it could be or
52 uh
52800 I think this was way better
right yeah look at
right yeah look at
that even this one is
that even this one is
better then that we didn't even look at
better then that we didn't even look at
this one
this is a lot
better that's weird that that bias term
better that's weird that that bias term
would mess stuff
would mess stuff
up I'll let it run a little longer just
up I'll let it run a little longer just
to be sure but
um and time steps are interesting
um and time steps are interesting
here well this is I mean this is bad
here well this is I mean this is bad
this is uh too early to do this didn't
this is uh too early to do this didn't
explore bat didn't explore anything
explore bat didn't explore anything
yeah so that's kind of weird
this is definitely bad okay well what if
this is definitely bad okay well what if
I get rid of this bias
because let's just try this empirically
because let's just try this empirically
I have no idea if this should do
I have no idea if this should do
anything I don't honestly think it
anything I don't honestly think it
should
should
uh cost no
uh cost no
bias I honestly don't think that they
bias I honestly don't think that they
should do anything but we'll try it
I think you're still going to get the
I think you're still going to get the
weird
split I mean here's the other thing I
split I mean here's the other thing I
can do
can do
right I can just look
right I can just look
at this is the weird
at this is the weird
one this
one this
one so this is the best run that I have
it gets batch mini batch the only thing
it gets batch mini batch the only thing
it screws up for whatever weird reason
it screws up for whatever weird reason
is it doesn't get the learning rate it
is it doesn't get the learning rate it
gets gamma nicely it gets Lambda
gets gamma nicely it gets Lambda
nicely it's update Epoch
nicely it's update Epoch
Horizon this gets
Horizon this gets
everything the only two issues with this
everything the only two issues with this
so for whatever reason it doesn't get
so for whatever reason it doesn't get
learning rate but a lot of them have
learning rate but a lot of them have
that
that
problem and then the total time steps
problem and then the total time steps
doesn't go up fast
doesn't go up fast
enough this should really go up way
enough this should really go up way
faster because
like this Improvement is all just from
like this Improvement is all just from
time
step I mean that's a very simple
step I mean that's a very simple
experiment to
experiment to
run to just like double the time
run to just like double the time
step
waiting we'll run this first
I mean something still feels wrong to me
I mean something still feels wrong to me
about this
though
like all I do is absolute performance
like all I do is absolute performance
times
times
cost I me absolute performance this is
cost I me absolute performance this is
All I
All I
Do by what mechanism does this control
cost there's literally no penalty for
cost there's literally no penalty for
sampling longer and longer
runs like early
runs like early
how do you get 4,000 m's on a
CPU these are all written in C they run
CPU these are all written in C they run
a m like they run a million steps per
a m like they run a million steps per
second on One Core minimum so you
second on One Core minimum so you
literally just run them serially in a
literally just run them serially in a
loop on One Core that's
it nothing
it nothing
magic so of them are a little heavier so
magic so of them are a little heavier so
we multiprocess them maybe we use two
we multiprocess them maybe we use two
cores for some of them a couple of them
cores for some of them a couple of them
a few more than that but
a few more than that but
yeah they're just really really
fast they're not that hard to write
fast they're not that hard to write
either we've got all sorts of brand new
either we've got all sorts of brand new

get a batch of 4,000
get a batch of 4,000
observations but they're run in serial
observations but they're run in serial
it's just that they run so fast that you

don't notice
like our training will have 0% Z to 1%

the GPU environments a lot of them
the GPU environments a lot of them
because they waste time running they

High Fidelity physics is because like
High Fidelity physics is because like
researchers really want to write Python
researchers really want to write Python
and uh it turns out if you just write

stuff in C it's
stuff in C it's
faster I'm being a little bit faes here
faster I'm being a little bit faes here
like we did some additional optimization
like we did some additional optimization
there's some fancy shared memory stuff
there's some fancy shared memory stuff
um but if you look at the code it's
um but if you look at the code it's
really easy to write these things like
really easy to write these things like
the CPU environment code is dramatically
the CPU environment code is dramatically
simpler than GPU environment code like
simpler than GPU environment code like
compare puffer environments to like
compare puffer environments to like
Jack's environments it is so much less
Jack's environments it is so much less
painful to write our our CPU environment
painful to write our our CPU environment
and they're faster
I'm really not happy with the way that
this I'm pretty sure what's happening
this I'm pretty sure what's happening
here as lame as this is I'm pretty sure
here as lame as this is I'm pretty sure
what's
what's
happening is just total time step starts
happening is just total time step starts
out
out
low and it just takes a while uh because
low and it just takes a while uh because
the standard deviation of the search
the standard deviation of the search
space for this parameter so low it just
space for this parameter so low it just
takes a while to increase
takes a while to increase
it so like essentially it's just you
it so like essentially it's just you
have until the algorithm bumps this
have until the algorithm bumps this
parameter up too much because it's going
parameter up too much because it's going
to bump this parameter up because it
to bump this parameter up because it
gets better perf out of it um so you
gets better perf out of it um so you
just have it until it bumps this
just have it until it bumps this
parameter up to hopefully fit all the

other
other
parameters which like it happens to do

in this case relatively well there a
in this case relatively well there a
couple quirks
that's not how it should
work it should have an explicit

confident yeah confident
I mean I guess that is actually what
I mean I guess that is actually what
happens to be fair because we have a
happens to be fair because we have a
conservative bound on stuff
conservative bound on stuff
right wait a second we have a
right wait a second we have a

like write a rapper M that runs multiple

we have vectorization as well yeah we do
we have vectorization as well yeah we do
we have the best multi-processing out
we have the best multi-processing out
there in fact so yes you can run you can

you can run on 16 cores if you'd like in
you can run on 16 cores if you'd like in
fact we do that for a few of our
fact we do that for a few of our
environments that are a little slower or
environments that are a little slower or
not even a little slower they have more
not even a little slower they have more
bandwidth really um but most of our
bandwidth really um but most of our
environments are just so fast that one
environments are just so fast that one
or two cores and you're
good mostly the ones are slow is the
good mostly the ones are slow is the
ones that are slower just because we're

we'll get to improving those
we'll get to improving those
though I mean you can go read any of our

they're like they're one file a piece
they're like they're one file a piece
they're super simple like people go ask
they're super simple like people go ask

this is the whole code 300 lines this is

like this pretty much like neural MMO is
like this pretty much like neural MMO is
one of the most complicated RL
one of the most complicated RL
environments out there and it's one file
environments out there and it's one file
it's going to be 3,000 lines 2800 lines
it's going to be 3,000 lines 2800 lines
but just like one file of really simple
but just like one file of really simple
code so this scales as well you can go
code so this scales as well you can go
from very very simple environments to
from very very simple environments to
very very complicated environments like
very very complicated environments like
this and they'll all be
fast neural mo3 is like 1.9 million
fast neural mo3 is like 1.9 million
steps per second on One
Core it's a fun time come right to

environment with us
this year is a somewhat Less Fun Time
this year is a somewhat Less Fun Time
this is a bunch of math and it's hurting
this is a bunch of math and it's hurting
my head
today but it's very
today but it's very
important so I will do
it there is kind of implicitly a time
it there is kind of implicitly a time
management thing in
here so
the absolute
the absolute
performance is going to bias you towards
performance is going to bias you towards
longer runs but only if you're confident
longer runs but only if you're confident
because it's a conservative
because it's a conservative
bound and because you start off running
bound and because you start off running
shorter
shorter
runs you're not allowed to run longer
runs you're not allowed to run longer
runs until you're confident
so I don't think you need to actually
so I don't think you need to actually
penalize cost I think you already have
penalize cost I think you already have
cost
cost
penalized you have it penalized VI
uncertainty because it's not actually
uncertainty because it's not actually
bad to run high cost experiments it's
bad to run high cost experiments it's
only bad to
only bad to
run high cost experiments that you're
run high cost experiments that you're
wrong about and don't do well you want
wrong about and don't do well you want
to run higher and higher cost
to run higher and higher cost
experiments in fact you want to run the
experiments in fact you want to run the
higher cost experiments ASAP as soon as
higher cost experiments ASAP as soon as
you're confident in them
I could experiment with an even more
I could experiment with an even more
conservative
conservative
bound I could do two standard deviation
bound that's like a really conservative
bound that's like a really conservative
bound
bound
right does that do anything for you
maybe let's see what this one is I don't
maybe let's see what this one is I don't
think that this is done very well let's
think that this is done very well let's
check I'd be surprised it's
check I'd be surprised it's
theoretically it's poorly
theoretically it's poorly
motivated it's possible empirically it
motivated it's possible empirically it
does
okay where did I put it I have way too
okay where did I put it I have way too
many freaking Windows uh let's just
many freaking Windows uh let's just
close some of these
I need
this ah where my windows go
how I get over
there so
there so
1,200 and 75
experiments where's our Pito
experiments where's our Pito
from the hell there it
from the hell there it
is all right clean parito front but I
is all right clean parito front but I
think that this is just lower perf
think that this is just lower perf
overall this is 1200
at it's 1,200 like
at it's 1,200 like
[Music]
[Music]
versus
it yeah so this is the worst one and
it yeah so this is the worst one and
it's still worse than this
this
this
one yeah there we
one yeah there we
go so this is just not that
good not very good which is expected
good not very good which is expected
because this doesn't make any
because this doesn't make any
sense so get rid of
this and let's just
this and let's just
do let's just increase some parameters
this could
this could
potentially change quite a
potentially change quite a
bit so this is our best right
now and this is like almost perfect
now and this is like almost perfect
it could literally just be tuning some
it could literally just be tuning some
scale parameters from here to be
honest you
know oh look at
know oh look at
that well these are going to be too
that well these are going to be too
long to start with potentially
think you start the time even lower but
think you start the time even lower but
with a bigger scale
with a bigger scale
maybe it's a little
tricky to do
that dynamically growing the cost is
that dynamically growing the cost is
difficult
yeah dynamically growing the cost will
yeah dynamically growing the cost will
be
difficult let me
think so the difficult thing here is
if I just do this based around like
if I just do this based around like
total time steps
total time steps
right the initial
right the initial
samples are going to be around that time
samples are going to be around that time
scale the initial samples are going to
scale the initial samples are going to
be like
randomish so I mean if I do like a
100 I don't want to start at a 100
100 I don't want to start at a 100
million but be randomly sampling 500
million but be randomly sampling 500
million that's going to take for
million that's going to take for
freaking ever
you really want a better way of
you really want a better way of
dynamically
dynamically
growing growing the
compute you really want a much better
compute you really want a much better
way of dynamically growing the compute
well to be fair I think the current
well to be fair I think the current
thing I have
is it's really just the
initialization that's difficult right
initialization that's difficult right
like cuz I think that the method I have
like cuz I think that the method I have
at the
at the
moment it should actually work very well
moment it should actually work very well
it's just keeping the
keeping the cost below to begin
with you could penalize cost uncertain
with you could penalize cost uncertain
cost
cost
actually if you penalize cost when there
actually if you penalize cost when there
is uncertainty that could fix it
yeah I think that actually might be the
yeah I think that actually might be the
way because that will prevent you that
way because that will prevent you that
will like push your uh that should push
will like push your uh that should push
your runs to the bottom of the time
your runs to the bottom of the time
scale at the start of training
wrong CLA

this look looks
better
cost for

on GitHub it really helps me out a ton
on GitHub it really helps me out a ton
it's
it's
free I gave Claud C custom instructions
free I gave Claud C custom instructions
then it added an additional sense to the

what
no this is so dumb
already star very good the puffer thanks
already star very good the puffer thanks
you for your
you for your

maybe it doesn't have to be a continuous
function you
know yeah it would be better if it were
it's got to be
like it's got to be like Max
one and then like
I'm not reading that [ __ ]
I'm not reading that [ __ ]
[Music]
[Music]
anyways Max
zero
for e
this it
what do you want this function to
what do you want this function to
do I want it to be a cost
do I want it to be a cost
penalty um it should penalize you if
penalty um it should penalize you if
your cost is it should penalize you for
your cost is it should penalize you for
select a high cost when you have high
select a high cost when you have high
uncertainty about the cost so the
uncertainty about the cost so the
function has to go to one when your cost
function has to go to one when your cost
certainty which is the standard
certainty which is the standard
deviation is below a specific threshold
deviation is below a specific threshold
and then it has to smoothly it has to be
and then it has to smoothly it has to be
a continuous function that scales up
a continuous function that scales up
based on the cost from
there this is
there this is
close the only thing is that this is
which does require you to subtract the
which does require you to subtract the
threshold from the scaling
Factor Why would you square it
that's a Max of
that's a Max of
zero and standard
zero and standard
[Music]
deviation does that work I don't know if
deviation does that work I don't know if
that
that
works if that does work then I'm
works if that does work then I'm
incredibly tired for not figuring that
incredibly tired for not figuring that
out let me see but I don't think it does
out let me see but I don't think it does
so
so
cost times the max
yeah that's a bad
yeah that's a bad
idea you should keep it linear there's
idea you should keep it linear there's
no reason to square
no reason to square
that
that
um I've been staring at this map all
day
day
well the only thing there is the
well the only thing there is the
standard deviation minus
the
the
threshold I think you have to divide by
threshold I think you have to divide by
threshold if you do that no we're not
threshold if you do that no we're not
[ __ ] exponentiating it either [ __ ]
[ __ ] exponentiating it either [ __ ]
that
um I think it might be hold
um I think it might be hold
on cost times
Max does this do it
if threshold is
0.5 I think that fixes the thing where
0.5 I think that fixes the thing where
because you subtract the
threshold well
threshold well
because you're scaling it down by
because you're scaling it down by
subtracting the threshold from the
subtracting the threshold from the
standard deviation
right you have to do that to have the
right you have to do that to have the
threshold but you're scaling down the
threshold but you're scaling down the
standard
standard

deviation I guess wait the one plus kind
of covers
it does that do it
I think we'll try
I think we'll try
this how's uh this sweep
this how's uh this sweep
going it looks like this one's going
going it looks like this one's going
pretty damn
well what in the [ __ ]
so uh this is better than

best but it's got this weird
artifact so this got to 2900 by the very

right here this
right here this

fantastic but this is weird as
fantastic but this is weird as

so that it like it latches on to you see

fixed uh gamma is also
fixed uh gamma is also
fixed Lambda is
fixed Lambda is
bizarre there's always one parameter off
bizarre there's always one parameter off
it's weird lambda's way
off Lambda is supposed to be 0.95 so I
off Lambda is supposed to be 0.95 so I
have no idea how it drifts like this we

it's down here this is very weird these
it's down here this is very weird these

good and then cost is like this oh wait
good and then cost is like this oh wait
but this is actually a Pito front
but this is actually a Pito front
I thought it was going to give us the
I thought it was going to give us the
weird curve again but this is actually
weird curve again but this is actually
good um yeah this is actually very
good um yeah this is actually very
good so these points
good so these points
here AB 12 27 like this is very very
here AB 12 27 like this is very very
very nice for a Pito front here I don't
very nice for a Pito front here I don't
know why there's nothing

perfect and see it's at Max
cost oh you know what this is I know
cost oh you know what this is I know
what this
what this
is this is resampling Paro

resample argument to carbs that will
resample argument to carbs that will
randomly resample a paredo
randomly resample a paredo
point that's all this
is so this is a benchmark that's now I
is so this is a benchmark that's now I
don't know if it's full solved is the
don't know if it's full solved is the
only thing it's almost full solved but
only thing it's almost full solved but
it missed one parameter learning rate
let me try this
let me try this
um this cost
penalty I don't even think we need this
penalty I don't even think we need this
to be honest now cuz this is so good but
so ciruit model outputs
many Bruns are we at Are we almost done
many Bruns are we at Are we almost done
with this I can just do this in a
with this I can just do this in a
separate tab right
cops e
it's so
long my break
long my break
point I could have just set the ARs to

be faster
for e
okay
so where is the cost
lost
estimate CAU
estimate CAU
ciruit model

because they're just they're desktop
because they're just they're desktop
class machines you just need 20 Outlets

I'll get linky right
I'll ask him if he thinks there's going

gigabit connection I don't know if we
gigabit connection I don't know if we
can even get a 10 gab connection there
though for
though for
functional I mean the main thing that's
functional I mean the main thing that's
gone wrong with the small cluster is
gone wrong with the small cluster is
just the micro code [ __ ]
right and I'll talk to linky the next

voice slow
internet well I don't know what we're
internet well I don't know what we're
going to be able to do about that I
going to be able to do about that I
don't know if we can get um 10 gigabit
don't know if we can get um 10 gigabit
out there I might have to bandwidth
out there I might have to bandwidth
optimize and really the only thing that
optimize and really the only thing that
you
you
do is um is wan be or

Neptune which I can bandwidth optimize
Neptune which I can bandwidth optimize
puffer for that just by packing stuff
puffer for that just by packing stuff
tighter
there's internet there's at least a
there's internet there's at least a
gigabit I just don't know if we get 10
gabit I yeah I can do starlink but I
gabit I yeah I can do starlink but I
think that's
worse I can get it as a backup no
worse I can get it as a backup no
problem though
I look we'll talk let me finish this
I look we'll talk let me finish this
this is
this is
important
important
um what the [ __ ] is where's the cost
um what the [ __ ] is where's the cost
variance
variance
here where the hell is the cost variance
now Target bear is
now Target bear is
different
right yeah see this is surrogate to
right yeah see this is surrogate to
surrogate output
oh wait log cost there
can I just call this on the variance
I probably can
right
e e
ooh look at
ooh look at
this very very good 3200 that's that's a
this very very good 3200 that's that's a
new
new
record who is messaging me on Discord
uh bet I can tell you what this
is e
good
good
job
job
yeah I mean that's freaking good
right not this one
yeah that's real good I don't know what
yeah that's real good I don't know what
it is at the very end let's see what it
it is at the very end let's see what it
discovers at the very
end think this is
end think this is
fine the gamma I guess it fits gamma oh
fine the gamma I guess it fits gamma oh
it fits gamma and Lambda a little bit
it fits gamma and Lambda a little bit
better at the very end so we got to
better at the very end so we got to
figure out why these things don't fit
figure out why these things don't fit
properly like it it misses a few
properly like it it misses a few
parameters for too long
parameters for too long
this is close to Optimal
though what m is this this is a
though what m is this this is a
synthetic test
this has cost
this has cost
variance
weird okay we'll figure this out
I think it's it's 30 it's 3,000
I think it's it's 30 it's 3,000
something it's pretty close to what
something it's pretty close to what
we're
we're
at like I said it's just a synthetic
at like I said it's just a synthetic
test but
still oh
you
see I wouldn't get too excited yet
this could just be like
this could just be like
Randomness that doesn't
scale but to give you an idea that
scale but to give you an idea that
like original carbs was getting maybe a
like original carbs was getting maybe a
third of Max score in 200 runs and it
third of Max score in 200 runs and it
was like hard plateaued at a third of
was like hard plateaued at a third of
Max
Max
score so we have dramatically improved
score so we have dramatically improved
this algorithm
um at least on the synthetic task right
um at least on the synthetic task right
we're assuming that it
transfers if this like if this actually
transfers if this like if this actually
transfers to our other environments
transfers to our other environments
we're basically we'll have solved hyper
we're basically we'll have solved hyper
pram sweeps for RL or at least like
pram sweeps for RL or at least like
improved it several fold in the course
improved it several fold in the course
of a day and a
half I high score I think it's 3500 I
half I high score I think it's 3500 I
think I
think I
checked I can double check in a bit but
checked I can double check in a bit but
I think it's like
I think it's like
3500 like I said it's a synthetic task
3500 like I said it's a synthetic task
so I mean all it does is it assigns you
so I mean all it does is it assigns you
it assigns optimal values to the hyper
it assigns optimal values to the hyper
parameters um it defines like absolute
parameters um it defines like absolute
value distance penalty from those
value distance penalty from those
parameters and then it sets some some
parameters and then it sets some some
scaling parameters for um for cost
scaling parameters for um for cost
it's
it's
roughly models an RL problem but there's
roughly models an RL problem but there's
no noise in
no noise in
it so all your estimates are
perfect I think we're not going to need
perfect I think we're not going to need
this this extra little bit here I think
this this extra little bit here I think
we're just going to tune parameters and
we're just going to tune parameters and
be
be
good I mean potentially cost penalty is
good I mean potentially cost penalty is
kind of a reasonable thing to
do but like do you really need
it e
yeah I think this is
worse the way it biases cost isn't
worse the way it biases cost isn't
amazing
but it's
decent this is just a
test yeah this isn't
great I mean the parito front looks
great I mean the parito front looks
pretty
nice it is doing lowcost runs which is
nice it is doing lowcost runs which is
what you want
lambda's fit
lambda's fit
correctly gamma's fit
correctly learning rate
is kind of fit
correctly might want to give it a little
correctly might want to give it a little
time it's actually kind of doing the
time it's actually kind of doing the
correct thing
here so the goal here
is you don't just take into account
is you don't just take into account
score here
score here
um ideally what you want is you want
um ideally what you want is you want
your algorithm to run a ton of really
your algorithm to run a ton of really
fast experiments until it's very
fast experiments until it's very
confident that it understands how all
confident that it understands how all
the hyper parameters scale and then it
the hyper parameters scale and then it
runs like a couple midscale experiments
runs like a couple midscale experiments
to make sure that its fit is correct and
to make sure that its fit is correct and
then it runs the big experiments quite
then it runs the big experiments quite
quickly so you want to spend most of
quickly so you want to spend most of
your most of your experiment count on
your most of your experiment count on
Fast
experiments uh it shouldn't need early
experiments uh it shouldn't need early
stopping you could technically do it but
stopping you could technically do it but
the thing is this is It's cost aware so
the thing is this is It's cost aware so
it's supposed to actually
it's supposed to actually
um it's actually supposed to do that
um it's actually supposed to do that
itself early stopping is more for random
itself early stopping is more for random
search and such
okay I mean there's potentially more to
okay I mean there's potentially more to
do
with um cost
variance is it
working these higher cost runs aren't
working these higher cost runs aren't
trans in to better
perf I mean the ideal algorithm is going
perf I mean the ideal algorithm is going
to run a bunch of experiments at 50
mil e
yes so this does not
yes so this does not
work that's
work that's
fine we'll go back to the old one
so this should be good
okay
so maybe one more experiment
let me just go look at the parameters
let me just go look at the parameters
real
real
quick see if I can figure something
out we you total time
out we you total time
steps so 0.5 right
yeah these look fine I don't know why I
yeah these look fine I don't know why I
get stuck in weirdly weird
spots possibly needs more random trials
spots possibly needs more random trials
to be
honest that might be a decent idea
I want to make sure I'm on the right
I want to make sure I'm on the right
track at the very least
first
e
e e
oh this is still running breakout L it's
funny no wonder there's so many freaking
funny no wonder there's so many freaking
breakout results
let me make sure
uh ah good thing I caught
that
for e
okay we'll see what what this
does e
and actually we can
and actually we can
adjust total time
STS can adjust
STS can adjust
uh to time steps
we will try this for uh for PA
we shall see

look so we

all the optimizations in there there's
also the white paper it's there as
well this is biasing towards two uh two
well this is biasing towards two uh two
fast of runs I
guess let see what that
does this is nice
oh there you
go in Duro you cut 780
go in Duro you cut 780
lines might not be
lines might not be
working switching in it and
working switching in it and
reset yeah go figure out what you broke
what's the current length of the of
Enduro it's going to be funny because
Enduro it's going to be funny because
you're eventually going to get it down
you're eventually going to get it down
to roughly the length that I expected
to roughly the length that I expected
when I gave you the project okay 1400 is
when I gave you the project okay 1400 is
still more than I
still more than I
expected to give
expected to give
you I was hoping to give you like an 800
you I was hoping to give you like an 800
line
line
project and maybe it won't get to 800
project and maybe it won't get to 800
that's kind of
that's kind of
ambitious I mean if I did it maybe I
ambitious I mean if I did it maybe I
could get it to
could get it to
800 that'd be pretty tight though maybe
800 that'd be pretty tight though maybe
more like a
thousand
thousand
2300 well the 2300 was
2300 well the 2300 was
ridiculous now you're at least like
ridiculous now you're at least like
reasonably know reasonably close I'd say
I could definitely make it
I could definitely make it
1,200 I don't know about lower than
that if I really went through your
that if I really went through your
logic I'm pretty
confident exactly
confident exactly
like come on you look at my other code
I've spent like a day and a half on this
I've spent like a day and a half on this
and it looks like we're going to
and it looks like we're going to
revolutionize hyper parameter
revolutionize hyper parameter
tuning can get a lot done pretty quick
tuning can get a lot done pretty quick
when I've uh I'm locked
when I've uh I'm locked
in hope I'm hoping that this works on
in hope I'm hoping that this works on
these Ms we will
these Ms we will
see I'm not too bothered that this is
see I'm not too bothered that this is
taking a bunch of initial runs because I
taking a bunch of initial runs because I
set it to very very fast runs we'll see
set it to very very fast runs we'll see
though use it on every real that's what
though use it on every real that's what
I'm doing I got pong and breakout here
I'm doing I got pong and breakout here
these are both running I got these
these are both running I got these
running on two
boxes the breakout run should be longer
boxes the breakout run should be longer
and more stable the pong is like a quick
test I don't mind if pong takes a ton of
test I don't mind if pong takes a ton of
runs because the runs are really
quick these are literally like 10 10 to
quick these are literally like 10 10 to
20 second experiments
there we
go oh look at that we got a 11 million
go oh look at that we got a 11 million
step run that's already at 12
step run that's already at 12
score all right that looks nice
is
8:45 I mean this
8:45 I mean this
is look at the time steps it's launching
is look at the time steps it's launching
we train for 20 million in our Baseline
we train for 20 million in our Baseline
okay so it's launching really cheap
okay so it's launching really cheap
experiments here this was an intentional
experiments here this was an intentional
test to see if you can boot strap off
test to see if you can boot strap off
really cheap keep
experiments the breakout ones will be
experiments the breakout ones will be
substantially more
substantially more
expensive look at that it's already at
expensive look at that it's already at
80 though with this
one I want to see how this behaves we're
one I want to see how this behaves we're
going to
going to
see over
see over
time yeah that's a great that's a great
time yeah that's a great that's a great
thing to do actually here we'll do a
thing to do actually here we'll do a
quick session on the uh on the Discord
quick session on the uh on the Discord
it'll be on stream but I'll hop in the
it'll be on stream but I'll hop in the
Discord real quick while I like slowly
Discord real quick while I like slowly
fall into this chair exhausted
cool uh is desktop audio
cool uh is desktop audio
on should
on should
be got to go left so I can get those
be got to go left so I can get those
base dude I like these used to be good
base dude I like these used to be good
like these used to be pretty impressive
like these used to be pretty impressive
it's all gone it
it's all gone it
sucks oh I guarantee I guarantee Joseph
sucks oh I guarantee I guarantee Joseph
you are way stronger than Jeff
you are way stronger than Jeff
Bezos well yeah but still
we'll be back we'll be back pear in 40
we'll be back we'll be back pear in 40
soon
enough don't don't please don't push it

good what up bet yo I don't know worked
all [ __ ] day got a
lift I think I did the 3D com right not
lift I think I did the 3D com right not
100% convinced but yeah well we're about
100% convinced but yeah well we're about
to find out right
you said you're on Lincoln General chat
you said you're on Lincoln General chat
I don't see it though uh the voice chat
I don't see it though uh the voice chat
The Voice Channel
The Voice Channel
General and they got they got to rename
General and they got they got to rename
that or fix
that or fix
it I think you can rename any of these
it I think you can rename any of these
like in a second I think you could just
like in a second I think you could just
call voice chat I've got mod but I have
call voice chat I've got mod but I have
no mod po
so I don't know if that was attentional
so I don't know if that was attentional
it's it's a little confusing like like
it's it's a little confusing like like
the actual options in Discord are like
the actual options in Discord are like
pretty
pretty
pretty difficult to uh understand
I ask my
I ask my

good all right I linked it in uh the
good all right I linked it in uh the
voice
voice
chat I'm reading it
now it's frankly pretty good let's see
now it's frankly pretty good let's see
the voice
the voice
chat yeah should I I guess pop up on
chat yeah should I I guess pop up on
Twitch to watch what you're doing and
Twitch to watch what you're doing and
then just mute my mute the volume I
then just mute my mute the volume I
guess pop
up or yeah that probably
up or yeah that probably
best oh here it is Tower climb at the
bottom
bottom
good I got up at like 8 and I've just
good I got up at like 8 and I've just
been coding this thing you got up at 8
been coding this thing you got up at 8
because I saw you were streaming at
because I saw you were streaming at
like was I
like was I
streaming like I I'm pretty
streaming like I I'm pretty
early super early like I've been
early super early like I've been
streaming for a minute
streaming for a minute
6:45 was it 6:4 I don't think I was up
6:45 was it 6:4 I don't think I was up
that
that
early no I think it
early no I think it
was 13
hours 646 it says 13 hours ago it's 6
hours 646 it says 13 hours ago it's 6
6:46 was the time I have the email okay
6:46 was the time I have the email okay
I can prove it so it's 13 hours ago and
I can prove it so it's 13 hours ago and
I was I've been [ __ ] doing
I was I've been [ __ ] doing
from a short walk and meals I've been
from a short walk and meals I've been
streaming and coding the whole time the
streaming and coding the whole time the
whole time so I mean I got a lot done
whole time so I mean I got a lot done
though like I I redid half the math of
though like I I redid half the math of
carbs
carbs
so where's the Discord Channel
so where's the Discord Channel
freaking there we
freaking there we
go I readed half the math of carbs in
go I readed half the math of carbs in
that time I'm so what do we have here
that time I'm so what do we have here
we've got
really just super simple I think I think
really just super simple I think I think
layering it will still work on this
layering it will still work on this
we'll see so you have
we'll see so you have
one is it one channel by default okay
one is it one channel by default okay
CNN
CNN
channels three stri
one what's the size of the
one what's the size of the
window uh 6X 6 by 8 yeah then this is
window uh 6X 6 by 8 yeah then this is
good do
good do
this what's this
this what's this
size oh okay so this is if you compute
size oh okay so this is if you compute
it here so this is
it here so this is
128 256 okay this is a little
128 256 okay this is a little
big I might make this the I might cut
big I might make this the I might cut
this in half go
this in half go
128 well this cuz this is look this is
128 well this cuz this is look this is
32 for
32 for
128 256 6 52 so that's getting a little
128 256 6 52 so that's getting a little
big I might do this one I could do 16
big I might do this one I could do 16
instead of
instead of
32 and then it would be uh five was it
32 and then it would be uh five was it
256 256 I you try both of them because
256 256 I you try both of them because
that might screw it up because it's not
that might screw it up because it's not
that many channels but we'll see then
that many channels but we'll see then
you have
you have
flattened the heck is this a flat it's
flattened the heck is this a flat it's
the player obs
yeah you can do this I always with these
yeah you can do this I always with these
projection layers um I'm always tempted
projection layers um I'm always tempted
to just like feed this into the lstm but
to just like feed this into the lstm but
I think there's some quirks if you try
I think there's some quirks if you try
to do uh different input and hidden size
to do uh different input and hidden size
for the lstm so this is fine and then
for the lstm so this is fine and then
this I assume that you copied this and
this I assume that you copied this and
this with these two standard deviations
this with these two standard deviations
are correct and if so that's fine en
are correct and if so that's fine en

make sure that this is in the correct
make sure that this is in the correct

about that in the case of this puzzle
about that in the case of this puzzle
environment would it materially matter
environment would it materially matter
if it's like 6X 8X 6 or 6X you know what
if it's like 6X 8X 6 or 6X you know what
any combination of this because it's
any combination of this because it's
just being passed in as one giant 1D
just being passed in as one giant 1D
like yes it does

you ever like [ __ ] up image processing
and like transposed like the rows and
and like transposed like the rows and

like a corrupted
mess see like one
mess see like one
time I've done that yeah you you need to
time I've done that yeah you you need to
you need to actually just like open this
you need to actually just like open this
thing like go look at this thing and
thing like go look at this thing and
make sure that this is the observation
make sure that this is the observation
that you expect
this network is
this network is
fine wait
what oh yeah Network flat and then you
what oh yeah Network flat and then you
Pudge cat Pudge this is fine and then I
Pudge cat Pudge this is fine and then I
made a a slight lstm modification to
made a a slight lstm modification to
make the input 256 um that was something
make the input 256 um that was something
that I had to do in order for it to work
that I had to do in order for it to work
yeah that's
yeah that's
fine what happened when before what like
fine what happened when before what like
it didn't work with 128 if yeah so the
it didn't work with 128 if yeah so the
default of the lstm in the if you under
default of the lstm in the if you under
recurrent is expects a 128 input so you
recurrent is expects a 128 input so you
have to make
have to make
a did you try it with 128 first or did
a did you try it with 128 first or did
you just go to
you just go to
256 well I tried to just run it without
256 well I tried to just run it without
having like the super class and then um
having like the super class and then um
well you have to change this hidden size
well you have to change this hidden size
has to be 128 if you're going to do that
has to be 128 if you're going to do that
but no okay no I haven't tried it with
but no okay no I haven't tried it with
128 I just tried it with 256 start you
128 I just tried it with 256 start you
should try you should try both if it's
should try you should try both if it's
if 128 Works it'll run faster it be
if 128 Works it'll run faster it be
better yeah so 256 it actually during
better yeah so 256 it actually during
this I tried to train some and it did
this I tried to train some and it did
start to learn so I hopefully presume
start to learn so I hopefully presume
that means that a lot of things are
that means that a lot of things are
working um well that could be the comp
working um well that could be the comp
not the 256 you know know sure but I was
not the 256 you know know sure but I was
gonna say is the speed the speed got
gonna say is the speed the speed got
tanked yeah how long is it how fast is
tanked yeah how long is it how fast is
it 560 from 1 million
it 560 from 1 million
plus oh and how big is the
plus oh and how big is the
net uh 690k parameters it's about right
net uh 690k parameters it's about right
you that's about you you made a bigger
you that's about you you made a bigger
Network what do you
Network what do you
expect well I wouldn't expect it to cut
expect well I wouldn't expect it to cut
it in half but then what do you mean you
it in half but then what do you mean you
wouldn't expect to cut it down you went
wouldn't expect to cut it down you went
from 150k parameters to 600k like
from 150k parameters to 600k like
because if it's it's basically like
because if it's it's basically like
mostly Network that's taking up the time
mostly Network that's taking up the time
so I suppose it should be yeah my n is
so I suppose it should be yeah my n is
0% every everything is in train yes that
0% every everything is in train yes that
was yeah so the Net's a little big as
was yeah so the Net's a little big as
all okay so secondary question here
all okay so secondary question here
expensive
expensive
I mean this is pretty much hardcoded for
I mean this is pretty much hardcoded for
level one how would you recommend I set
level one how would you recommend I set
it up to do Dynamic based off of the the
it up to do Dynamic based off of the the
level sizes the level sizes changed from
level sizes the level sizes changed from
level to level like it won't necessarily
level to level like it won't necessarily
always be a 6X 6 by8 it could
always be a 6X 6 by8 it could
potentially Global Ops you do local Ops
potentially Global Ops you do local Ops
you give it you give it a 3D crop around
you give it you give it a 3D crop around
the uh around the
the uh around the
player okay so just do some like some
player okay so just do some like some
reasonable crop um up to yeah you're
reasonable crop um up to yeah you're
going to have to play around with how
going to have to play around with how
big how far you need to see you should
big how far you need to see you should
probably just figure out like if you
probably just figure out like if you
play the game how far you need to see in
play the game how far you need to see in
order to actually still play it so a
order to actually still play it so a
little tradeoff there so so here's kind
little tradeoff there so so here's kind
of like a slightly weird part right cuz
of like a slightly weird part right cuz
like if when you're playing the actual
like if when you're playing the actual
game like visually you can
game like visually you can
determine I guess some degree of depth
determine I guess some degree of depth
uh when you're looking at it m i mean
uh when you're looking at it m i mean
you for sure need to see like the full
you for sure need to see like the full
width of the
width of the
screen and
screen and
then I mean you can argue that you don't
then I mean you can argue that you don't
need to see entirely up but I guess up
need to see entirely up but I guess up
in the game you don't even you don't see
in the game you don't even you don't see
the whole thing in the game the camera's
the whole thing in the game the camera's
kind of zoomed in in in the puzzle mode
kind of zoomed in in in the puzzle mode
of which this is kind of extracting some
of which this is kind of extracting some
levels from you can for the mo you can
levels from you can for the mo you can
see pretty close but I I get what you
see pretty close but I I get what you
mean I'll make a window that seems
mean I'll make a window that seems
pretty reasonable and then probably like
pretty reasonable and then probably like
I don't know five maybe seven by seven
I don't know five maybe seven by seven
by whatever yeah and sure and so instead
by whatever yeah and sure and so instead
of having it centered on player I I
of having it centered on player I I
would presume I'd Center it like maybe
would presume I'd Center it like maybe
one like two above player because you
one like two above player because you
really don't need to look at below you
really don't need to look at below you
realistically you can do
realistically you can do
that and that's all that would all be
that and that's all that would all be
within the N logic right that during
within the N logic right that during
that well it's within it's all in
that well it's within it's all in
compute observations as all yeah yeah
compute observations as all yeah yeah
yeah yeah okay so I could do that and
yeah yeah okay so I could do that and
then run a fresh sweep n nuke all like
then run a fresh sweep n nuke all like
the previously kind of somewhat
the previously kind of somewhat
understood parameters because now we're
understood parameters because now we're
on a 3D con
on a 3D con
you can keep your parameters and then
you can keep your parameters and then
what you do is you make the graphs in
what you do is you make the graphs in
the dashboard and you see if the best
the dashboard and you see if the best
runs are at the edge of any of your
runs are at the edge of any of your
ranges and if they're at the edge of
ranges and if they're at the edge of
your range then you have to expand the
range okay you know what I mean that I
range okay you know what I mean that I
mean I presume if like all of the
mean I presume if like all of the
parameters are it's shooting for are all
parameters are it's shooting for are all
like you know say if it's I set a range
like you know say if it's I set a range
from 09 to 0.95 and all them are at 094
from 09 to 0.95 and all them are at 094
999 then expand it
999 then expand it
so I can do that from an early test I
so I can do that from an early test I
did notice that it was able to achieve a
did notice that it was able to achieve a
higher score in a much quicker time
higher score in a much quicker time
frame but it has not been able to beat
frame but it has not been able to beat
the game
the game
yet it has not been able to what you are
yet it has not been able to what you are
far away and
far away and
quiet yeah the local Ops crop might
quiet yeah the local Ops crop might
actually help
you what I one thing that I was thinking
you what I one thing that I was thinking
about in terms of like a reward
about in terms of like a reward
engineering thing and you know was
what if I rewarded it for various
what if I rewarded it for various
patterns that like the game shows you as
patterns that like the game shows you as
like useful techniques instead of just
like useful techniques instead of just
like the most basic like saying like you
like the most basic like saying like you
get rewarded for going up and you get
get rewarded for going up and you get
penalized for going down yeah probably
penalized for going down yeah probably
too complicated to be honest I wouldn't
too complicated to be honest I wouldn't
bother I wouldn't bothering that much I
bother I wouldn't bothering that much I
think you'll just I think you'll just
think you'll just I think you'll just
get it you if you want to spend time on
get it you if you want to spend time on
anything you might do like the random
anything you might do like the random
level stuff that' probably be fun for
level stuff that' probably be fun for
you sure
you sure
I reward ship for weeks is just not fun
I reward ship for weeks is just not fun
or
or
useful yeah I mean I at least want to
useful yeah I mean I at least want to
see if I can get this to beat at least
see if I can get this to beat at least
the first level pretty cleanly easily
the first level pretty cleanly easily
and get there see how well it does on
and get there see how well it does on
maybe like two or three levels and then
maybe like two or three levels and then
I'll mess with the PG stuff where you
I'll mess with the PG stuff where you
just like dunk in like
just like dunk in like
10,000 hopefully this this sweep stuff
10,000 hopefully this this sweep stuff
is better we'll
see oh kind these sces aren't great yet
see oh kind these sces aren't great yet
but also i' I've set it to like really
but also i' I've set it to like really
fast runs only it's trying to build up a
fast runs only it's trying to build up a
predictive model at the moment I don't
predictive model at the moment I don't
know about these batch
know about these batch
sizes or these mini
batches we'll see what it's doing
batches we'll see what it's doing
here yeah I guess I see what you mean
here yeah I guess I see what you mean
when I asked you a couple days ago to
when I asked you a couple days ago to
and you're like yeah don't worry too
and you're like yeah don't worry too
much about the policy stuff because it's
much about the policy stuff because it's
like you mentioned it's like not very
like you mentioned it's like not very
complicated really not right to set up
complicated really not right to set up
this one I mean I think I only spent
this one I mean I think I only spent
like an hour or two kind of messing with
like an hour or two kind of messing with
it and then really not that was start
it and then really not that was start
training it'll be less than an hour or
training it'll be less than an hour or
two once you get better it would take
two once you get better it would take
you 20
you 20
minutes
minutes
sure we'll
see so did you see the carb stuff I've
see so did you see the carb stuff I've
been
been
doing I haven't been able to really
doing I haven't been able to really
follow it throughout today so um what
follow it throughout today so um what
kind of I know you said you're like
kind of I know you said you're like
redoing the math but can you dive like a
redoing the math but can you dive like a
little bit as an explanation or catch me
little bit as an explanation or catch me
up a little bit Yeah so is this thir
up a little bit Yeah so is this thir
good one yeah so this
good one yeah so this
is basically a full solve of a synthetic
is basically a full solve of a synthetic
hyper parameter tuning task with the
hyper parameter tuning task with the
cleanest the cleanest progress curve
cleanest the cleanest progress curve
you've ever seen on a hyper parameter
you've ever seen on a hyper parameter
sweep yeah I mean it looks pretty nasty
sweep yeah I mean it looks pretty nasty
to
to
me that like typically it's just like
me that like typically it's just like
all over the freaking place so these are
all over the freaking place so these are
this is like consistent
this is like consistent
Improvement these points here these are
Improvement these points here these are
resampled points these are resampled
resampled points these are resampled
parito optimal points so it's basically
parito optimal points so it's basically
it's checking its
it's checking its
work um this is look different from like
work um this is look different from like
the curves that I have it starts right
the curves that I have it starts right
here you can see it starts off with
here you can see it starts off with
really fast runs and then it gets
really fast runs and then it gets
confident and it just very quickly goes
confident and it just very quickly goes
to very long runs cuz in this case
to very long runs cuz in this case
that's what gives you perf so you see
that's what gives you perf so you see
right around here it gets this last perf
right around here it gets this last perf
bump yeah um it's got you know hyper
bump yeah um it's got you know hyper
prems very latched on very quickly the
prems very latched on very quickly the
optimal there are a couple small quirks
optimal there are a couple small quirks
where it doesn't get everything quite
where it doesn't get everything quite
perfect like Lambda for instance for
perfect like Lambda for instance for
some reason it has Lambda too high up
some reason it has Lambda too high up
until the very end um but it pretty much
until the very end um but it pretty much
just gets everything very quickly with a
just gets everything very quickly with a
few small
exceptions and this is the Pito front
exceptions and this is the Pito front
you can see there like a few misses but
you can see there like a few misses but
out of 200 runs it's basically a perfect
out of 200 runs it's basically a perfect
parito front with a few like a few
parito front with a few like a few
misses over
misses over
here
here
um so
um so
yeah
yeah
so on
so on
a go forward basis when I'm kind of
a go forward basis when I'm kind of
working more on the science side stuff
working more on the science side stuff
the stuff I did today would be
the stuff I did today would be
absolutely hard as [ __ ] this took every
absolutely hard as [ __ ] this took every
this took like most of what I knew um
this took like most of what I knew um
understood this is to give you an idea
understood this is to give you an idea
the carbs hyper pram sweep algorithm has
the carbs hyper pram sweep algorithm has
three different gaussian processes that
three different gaussian processes that
are used for various things uh it has
are used for various things uh it has
several probabilistic reings and several
several probabilistic reings and several
kind of weird uh space Transformations
kind of weird uh space Transformations
for various types of parameters and
for various types of parameters and
2,000 lines of code that probably should
2,000 lines of code that probably should
be around 700 lines of code um so I
be around 700 lines of code um so I
redesigned like half of the math on this
redesigned like half of the math on this
algorithm based off of just like staring
algorithm based off of just like staring
through the paper for a very long time
through the paper for a very long time
sure I first of all I fixed their space
sure I first of all I fixed their space
Transformations that was kind of the
Transformations that was kind of the
initial thing that got me
initial thing that got me
started I a lot of their mask a lot of
started I a lot of their mask a lot of
their like their candidate sample
their like their candidate sample
filtering I replaced with clam
filtering I replaced with clam
I got rid of this search term entirely
I got rid of this search term entirely
based off of some analysis I did
based off of some analysis I did
I completely changed this acquisition
I completely changed this acquisition
function clamping thing I replaced this
function clamping thing I replaced this
with a a completely different
with a a completely different
function and there were a few other
function and there were a few other
changes as
changes as
well so yeah like this is a whole new
well so yeah like this is a whole new
algorithm at this
algorithm at this
point um
point um
it works we'll see whether we'll see how
it works we'll see whether we'll see how
well it transfers to the real RL tasks
well it transfers to the real RL tasks
but the original algorithm fails a very
but the original algorithm fails a very
basic synthetic task and the uh the new
basic synthetic task and the uh the new
one crushes it uh why would it fail a
one crushes it uh why would it fail a
basic task there are lots of issues with
basic task there are lots of issues with
the
algorithm and if you look at this so if
algorithm and if you look at this so if
you look at this here's the thing that
you look at this here's the thing that
doesn't make sense right they say that
doesn't make sense right they say that
this is like really good in this Crush
this is like really good in this Crush
has all these benchmarks but if you look
has all these benchmarks but if you look
at the
at the
RL all these different algorithms
RL all these different algorithms
including carbs lose to Asha as's a
including carbs lose to Asha as's a
really [ __ ]
really [ __ ]
algorithm that's what the sh stands
algorithm that's what the sh stands
for no it's um it's basically Asha Asha
for no it's um it's basically Asha Asha
is literally just a random search with
is literally just a random search with
adaptive compute so like you can get an
adaptive compute so like you can get an
upper you can do like an upper bound on
upper you can do like an upper bound on
Asha just by doing like the number of
Asha just by doing like the number of
Random sech trials that Asha is going to
Random sech trials that Asha is going to
do for the full number of time
do for the full number of time
steps so like is hebo any good or is
steps so like is hebo any good or is
that like yeah hebo is good but carbs is
that like yeah hebo is good but carbs is
built on hebo so carbs should be better
built on hebo so carbs should be better
than hebo okay lower is better here so
than hebo okay lower is better here so
carbs is better carbs is better and then
carbs is better carbs is better and then
carbs is better so so those these they
carbs is better so so those these they
don't have they don't have the uh GitHub
don't have they don't have the uh GitHub
for like the the testing do they they
for like the the testing do they they
don't have that code available they sent
don't have that code available they sent
me some of it but the thing is it's
me some of it but the thing is it's
really slow they ran this like at
really slow they ran this like at
massive scale yeah I bet it yeah
massive scale yeah I bet it yeah
exactly so but the thing is because they
exactly so but the thing is because they
ran this at massive scale look all of
ran this at massive scale look all of
their experiments were at like at least
their experiments were at like at least
a 100 times slower than ours actually
a 100 times slower than ours actually
like a thousand times slower for a lot
like a thousand times slower for a lot
of them so my expectation is even though
of them so my expectation is even though
they have a fair number of gpus we're
they have a fair number of gpus we're
actually going to run more experiments
actually going to run more experiments
than they are on like two gpus because
than they are on like two gpus because
our stuff is so fast which is kind of
our stuff is so fast which is kind of
cool right
cool right
well it makes sense to uh some which
well it makes sense to uh some which
means we get better results right we
means we get better results right we
we're able to actually test it
we're able to actually test it
properly which which things can't we
properly which which things can't we
test on
test on
there oh all the tasks they use are
there oh all the tasks they use are
slow are there any things that that that
slow are there any things that that that
are not going to be testable using the
are not going to be testable using the
using
using
a uh puffer native environment no we
a uh puffer native environment no we
we'll just test like puffer native
we'll just test like puffer native
versus original carbs and we'll be good
versus original carbs and we'll be good
so so those those particular it doesn't
so so those those particular it doesn't
matter to test on those particular tests
matter to test on those particular tests
that they've tested on no they just ch
that they've tested on no they just ch
some like they just chose some standard
some like they just chose some standard
RL Tas that run 5,000 steps a
RL Tas that run 5,000 steps a
second
second
H doesn't matter at
H doesn't matter at
all it would be nice to have direct
all it would be nice to have direct
comparison we'll just Test original
comparison we'll just Test original
carbs on our environments right yeah
carbs on our environments right yeah
yeah you
yeah you
can it doesn't matter
can it doesn't matter
but well it's potentially maybe
but well it's potentially maybe
application specific
yeah it
yeah it
n well again look this is these are
n well again look this is these are
these are still very short runs this is
these are still very short runs this is
pong is uh without frame Skip and we're
pong is uh without frame Skip and we're
only doing like this is was 14 million
only doing like this is was 14 million
or whatever so 69 runs let's go we'll
or whatever so 69 runs let's go we'll
see if it does in 200 if not I'll up the
see if it does in 200 if not I'll up the
budget a little bit Y is this the exact
budget a little bit Y is this the exact
same setting that you were just using
same setting that you were just using
for yeah okay same setting minus the
for yeah okay same setting minus the
different total time step config and
different total time step config and
then breakout has a larger budget
then breakout has a larger budget
because breakout takes longer so we'll
because breakout takes longer so we'll
see we'll see how this does it's a
see we'll see how this does it's a
little iffy because some of these tasks
little iffy because some of these tasks
are very like seed dependent and stuff
are very like seed dependent and stuff
so we'll see how it does on these but
so we'll see how it does on these but
should be
should be
interesting linky am I am I like totally
interesting linky am I am I like totally
missing that there's a bunch of
missing that there's a bunch of
complicated stuff I'm not anticipating
complicated stuff I'm not anticipating
with a
with a
cluster linky talk please
[Applause]
[Applause]
um wor sorry sorry my my kid's going to
um wor sorry sorry my my kid's going to
be loud um but the worry is
be loud um but the worry is
scale yeah
scale yeah
honestly because look at all the little
honestly because look at all the little
problems you're having with like six
problems you're having with like six
boxes well the main problem having six
boxes well the main problem having six
boxes is microne to be
boxes is microne to be
fair
fair
um I wouldn't say fully
um I wouldn't say fully
100% I mean changes by the way they're
100% I mean changes by the way they're
all going to be air cooled so we're not
all going to be air cooled so we're not
going to have to deal with broken water
going to have to deal with broken water
coolers that's good that's probably good
coolers that's good that's probably good
when you have that many machines
when you have that many machines
honestly
um yeah
um yeah
desktops really layout's going to be a
desktops really layout's going to be a
pain you're going to have to figure that
pain you're going to have to figure that
out it's just along one
out it's just along one
wall yeah but you're also going to have
wall yeah but you're also going to have
to verify on every box that your air is
to verify on every box that your air is
Flowing the correct way and you want to
Flowing the correct way and you want to
split it into a
split it into a
hot he said he said a guy's going to do
hot he said he said a guy's going to do
that I I think we should be I mean we're
that I I think we should be I mean we're
going to we have like we'll have pretty
going to we have like we'll have pretty
good AC in there and
ventilation it doesn't matter I mean
ventilation it doesn't matter I mean
imagine if you have every band pointing
imagine if you have every band pointing
in the same direction and you just have
in the same direction and you just have
a row of boxes down the center of the
room you need you need to have a a like
room you need you need to have a a like
probably a air flow that's that's
probably a air flow that's that's
sweeping the the hot the hot air away
sweeping the the hot the hot air away
and cooler air that's flowing in through
and cooler air that's flowing in through
the front you're going to have enough
the front you're going to have enough
bans in enough boxes in there to
bans in enough boxes in there to
actually affect the total room current
actually affect the total room current
like air
like air
circulation keep that in mind where dep
circulation keep that in mind where dep
what I will go I will go through it and
what I will go I will go through it and
look at the the layout suggested um also
look at the the layout suggested um also
think about Network
think about Network
redundancy um I could get a backup with
redundancy um I could get a backup with
stlink if we need
stlink if we need
it I think that's a good idea uh I don't
it I think that's a good idea uh I don't
the one thing is I don't know if we can
the one thing is I don't know if we can
get 10 gigabit there because it's like
get 10 gigabit there because it's like
it's on a far so I don't know if we can
it's on a far so I don't know if we can
get like 10 gigabit to to there or if
get like 10 gigabit to to there or if
it's going to be one we'll
it's going to be one we'll
see here's the thing like do you
imagine gig do you imagine gigabytes
imagine gig do you imagine gigabytes
going through through it and short
going through through it and short
amount of time like we might just put
amount of time like we might just put
some monitoring on there and yell at
some monitoring on there and yell at
anybody that's doing too much
anybody that's doing too much
logging well yeah there is that I think
logging well yeah there is that I think
that's smart but then it might even be
that's smart but then it might even be
wise to say how about you look at a
wise to say how about you look at a
network attached storage for all of them
network attached storage for all of them
and just partition that off to each
and just partition that off to each
machine and I really don't want to do I
machine and I really don't want to do I
really don't want to do shared file
really don't want to do shared file
system for these machines it's a pain in
system for these machines it's a pain in
the ass
the ass
uh that's fine I was going to say uh
uh that's fine I was going to say uh
you're going to have to set up logging
you're going to have to set up logging
on each individual machine oh no so for
on each individual machine oh no so for
that we'll
that we'll
do uh we'll do something for that um the
do uh we'll do something for that um the
question is what well those can just be
question is what well those can just be
installed over the local network right
installed over the local network right
that's like anable or
something
um maybe okay I'm sorry I just dropped
um maybe okay I'm sorry I just dropped
off the face of the Earth
off the face of the Earth
um and just amable or something for like
um and just amable or something for like
uh just like loing images on all of them
uh just like loing images on all of them
um we just like I spend some time making
um we just like I spend some time making
sure I got a good base image and I just
sure I got a good base image and I just
flash on
flash on
everything you can automate that all you
everything you can automate that all you
want really what I mean
is first of all setting up a log server
is first of all setting up a log server
you're going to want that you're going
you're going to want that you're going
to want some Central Point that way like
to want some Central Point that way like
you can't expect to get logged through
you can't expect to get logged through
and machine that's down so before it
and machine that's down so before it
goes down at least have it send off like
goes down at least have it send off like
oh [ __ ] I'm panicking yeah
oh [ __ ] I'm panicking yeah
um that box should
um that box should
have like electrical segregation from
have like electrical segregation from
the rest you want that to be the last
the rest you want that to be the last
one that goes
one that goes
down um the reason why I'm
down um the reason why I'm
Pro like I'm not saying run everything
Pro like I'm not saying run everything
off of like shared
off of like shared
storage what I should say is you should
storage what I should say is you should
have a shared storage for a few reasons
have a shared storage for a few reasons
one of which is it'll make automating
one of which is it'll make automating
the process of installing way
the process of installing way
easier
easier
um passing files between boxes like you
um passing files between boxes like you
need to say hey these this group of 10
need to say hey these this group of 10
boxes need to do this specific thing now
boxes need to do this specific thing now
you can just iterate over all the boxes
you can just iterate over all the boxes
with one command from one file
with one command from one file
space um

yeah it's just when you get people
yeah it's just when you get people
shared storage access they [ __ ] up

this happen in every academic cluster
this happen in every academic cluster
ever and it's just [ __ ] cancer it's

so bad
yeah maybe like a

um can I literally just
um can I literally just
like you don't even need that just to
like you don't even need that just to
flash images though
flash images though
right well you don't wanna you do not
right well you don't wanna you do not
want you want images you can Network
want you want images you can Network
boot so you don't even need like a whole
boot so you don't even need like a whole
network attached storage but ideally you
network attached storage but ideally you
have something on the network that says
have something on the network that says
like hey this is an image you can just
like hey this is an image you can just
Network boot
Network boot
from uh either that or you know you're
from uh either that or you know you're
going to go to each and every box with a
going to go to each and every box with a
flash drive and manually well no not not
flash drive and manually well no not not
a flash drive I was I was hoping to just
a flash drive I was I was hoping to just
load
load
can I not just load the image onto the
can I not just load the image onto the
boxes over the
boxes over the
network or something and answer will
network or something and answer will
take care of
that yeah but you're talking about
that yeah but you're talking about
like operating systems not just like
software that's gonna I don't
software that's gonna I don't

logging there needs to be Central Lo log
logging there needs to be Central Lo log
a log server that things automatically

get all the logs uh that's probably good
we gotta be careful with bandwith you
we gotta be careful with bandwith you

about like structure you want every box
about like structure you want every box
to have two ethernet ports you want both

not that bad okay well uh you we're
not that bad okay well uh you we're
getting you a firewall because you can
getting you a firewall because you can
build one really cheap since you don't
build one really cheap since you don't

complicated we can fly we fly link out
fly well flying Linko is not gonna you
fly well flying Linko is not gonna you

going I was going to set the machines up
going I was going to set the machines up
you're going to do them all oh if you
you're going to do them all oh if you
GNA take a long time like a really long
GNA take a long time like a really long

probably I mean it shouldn't be that bad
probably I mean it shouldn't be that bad
if the it's going to be annoying to
if the it's going to be annoying to
figure out how to set up the anable
figure out how to set up the anable
script to like flash everything and to

make sure I actually get the base image
make sure I actually get the base image
right but physically putting the
right but physically putting the
machines in the racks is not that bad um
machines in the racks is not that bad um
that's not bad neither is really wiring

annoying because then you have to go
annoying because then you have to go
into each box you're going to assign
into each box you're going to assign

pdu a pdu would be smart and a network
pdu a pdu would be smart and a network
connected pdu of
course yeah the remote restart I can't
course yeah the remote restart I can't
really help because that's
like I've not had to do I have server
like I've not had to do I have server
grade like it needs to
grade like it needs to
be on a power distribution unit so that
be on a power distribution unit so that
you can manage the
power yeah but what happens is you go
power yeah but what happens is you go
look at the server grade ones and you
look at the server grade ones and you
see the what they charge just for the
see the what they charge just for the
putting the freaking server Factor no
putting the freaking server Factor no
it's yeah this are you talking the giant
it's yeah this are you talking the giant
rack batteries just go like oh look we
rack batteries just go like oh look we
can go H why does this one start $400
can go H why does this one start $400
more I'm sure that it won't go up way
more I'm sure that it won't go up way
more than $400 more when I click on it
more than $400 more when I click on it
right uh let's see we can
right uh let's see we can
do pro
do pro
RS where is this
thing
thing
figure oh let's see yes this is a server
figure oh let's see yes this is a server
unit and then we do
oh look just the rails okay then we do
oh look just the rails okay then we do
oh they got these on the website already
oh they got these on the website already
that's
that's
cool oh it doesn't even have a 4090
cool oh it doesn't even have a 4090
option isn't that
weird and here's the kicker probably
weird and here's the kicker probably
doesn't fit in the [ __ ] server
wack so we're at
wack so we're at
3700 for a garbage machine with a 47

this is here's the kicker is that pretty
this is here's the kicker is that pretty
much the desktop just dropped into a

consecutive generations of broken ships

oh that sounds bad yes yes it is very
oh that sounds bad yes yes it is very
bad to ship two generations of
bad to ship two generations of
consecutive broken
ships I'm a little confused
ships I'm a little confused
why this thing is so damn confident
I guess it's because I'm penalizing it
I guess it's because I'm penalizing it
from
doing I'm kind of penalizing it
for not having confident predictions
huh I might have to look at that there
huh I might have to look at that there
might have to be a better Suite of

synthetic benchmarks
synthetic benchmarks
we'll see just annoying because carbs is
we'll see just annoying because carbs is
actually not that fast to run it takes a
actually not that fast to run it takes a
few seconds for
prediction stuff to optimize
GMA
L really hasn't explored very much
a
start I'm trying to think if I shouldn't
start I'm trying to think if I shouldn't
be
be
penalizing there's a local Improvement
penalizing there's a local Improvement
term and then there's a global
term and then there's a global
Improvement
term they're both at the moment they're
term they're both at the moment they're
conservative meaning that they're
conservative meaning that they're
subtracting their uncertainty from their
subtracting their uncertainty from their
prediction but maybe I should only be
prediction but maybe I should only be
penalizing uncertainty on the global
scale which would then allow it a little
scale which would then allow it a little
bit more freedom to explore on the lower
end cuz it's like it's too scared to
end cuz it's like it's too scared to

certain hyper

amazing we'll see what this did you ever
amazing we'll see what this did you ever
see that uh like hyper parameter fral GI

and let me see if I can find it the PB
and let me see if I can find it the PB
BT or

something
something
it's it always made me a little bit
it's it always made me a little bit
afraid of hyper
afraid of hyper
like well trying to understand hyper
like well trying to understand hyper
parameters um oh I think I I think I
parameters um oh I think I I think I
know it's yeah the weird thing where
know it's yeah the weird thing where
it's like so
sensitive me see
can put it in uh in general if you want
can put it in uh in general if you want
to see
it it's like there's a pretty clear
it it's like there's a pretty clear
boundary at like the little the macro
boundary at like the little the macro
scale of like but then if you zoom in on
scale of like but then if you zoom in on
the hyper parameters it's just sort of
the hyper parameters it's just sort of
like an
like an
infinitely weird like it's like a
infinitely weird like it's like a
fractal right
funny we just Tred to hyper parameter go
funny we just Tred to hyper parameter go
bar yeah
bar yeah
oh although you know I guess it's
oh although you know I guess it's
important to know that what they're
important to know that what they're
zooming on on there is like a boundary
zooming on on there is like a boundary
right it's so maybe you don't you know
right it's so maybe you don't you know
you hopefully you're not like exactly in
you hopefully you're not like exactly in
a boundary between not working and
a boundary between not working and
working
oh
this yeah I've heard this I've seen
this I
think remind me not to go to SF
um I think I'm going to probably cue One
um I think I'm going to probably cue One
new
new
new one on this then go to sleep at
new one on this then go to sleep at
tomorrow I might do the micro code at

small things the goal for next week so
small things the goal for next week so
there going to be some academic collabs
there going to be some academic collabs
there's some client work and then I I
there's some client work and then I I
really want this hyper parameter thing
really want this hyper parameter thing
to be like the first major science side
to be like the first major science side
thing that we get working
thing that we get working
solidly
solidly
um the goal is that when you launch
um the goal is that when you launch
experiments right when you launch a
experiments right when you launch a
hyper parameter sweep you should be
hyper parameter sweep you should be
pretty damn confident that it's found
pretty damn confident that it's found
your best hyper parameters like you
your best hyper parameters like you
should be confident that the issue is
should be confident that the issue is
not hyper parameters after running a
not hyper parameters after running a
sweep so you know whatever result you
sweep so you know whatever result you
get you're getting the best the best
get you're getting the best the best
hyper parameters you can find that's the
hyper parameters you can find that's the
best version that you're getting with
best version that you're getting with
the current algorithm architecture
the current algorithm architecture
Etc because right now there's this huge
Etc because right now there's this huge
amount of sensitivity the hyper
amount of sensitivity the hyper
parameters and like it almost doesn't
parameters and like it almost doesn't
matter what your architectural algorithm
matter what your architectural algorithm
are because you still have no idea
are because you still have no idea
whether it's good or not because of the
whether it's good or not because of the
stupid hyper parameter
sensitivity yeah that that definitely
sensitivity yeah that that definitely
makes a lot of
makes a lot of
sense that's I think this is like the
sense that's I think this is like the
biggest bang for your buck first problem
biggest bang for your buck first problem
to look at it's kind of a hard
to look at it's kind of a hard
problem and I I like I wish that I like
problem and I I like I wish that I like
one of the baselines would be better
one of the baselines would be better
like I looked at Asha but it's
like I looked at Asha but it's
really it can't be as good as it's shown
really it can't be as good as it's shown
in the paper because it just can't
in the paper because it just can't
fundamentally based on what it is um so
fundamentally based on what it is um so
I think that just
I think that just
like I think a lot of these hyperr
like I think a lot of these hyperr
baselines are just weaker than they
baselines are just weaker than they
should be
because they're just not tuned correctly
because they're just not tuned correctly
I don't know what to say like they they
I don't know what to say like they they
have weird decisions and they're not set
have weird decisions and they're not set
up correctly um yeah it's kind of weird
up correctly um yeah it's kind of weird
that like outperforms hebo and stuff but
that like outperforms hebo and stuff but
like I guess for RL they're like they
like I guess for RL they're like they
kind of did some additional
kind of did some additional
considerations on hebo but then there's
considerations on hebo but then there's
still some like some bugs and errors and
still some like some bugs and errors and
stuff I know when you see 2,000 lines of
stuff I know when you see 2,000 lines of
code that wether should be 700 you kind
code that wether should be 700 you kind
of know some stuff's going to be dranky
of know some stuff's going to be dranky
and
and
broken so
broken so
I probably should just make a better
I probably should just make a better
synthetic test and get better local
synthetic test and get better local
logging for them
logging for them
um and then figure out if I can speed up
um and then figure out if I can speed up
carbs because it just takes too long to
carbs because it just takes too long to
run the damn thing on a test like really
run the damn thing on a test like really
you want like if you to run random
you want like if you to run random
search it runs instantly and you just
search it runs instantly and you just
get your experiment feedback
get your experiment feedback
instantly
instantly
um
um
yeah random search is not a terrible
yeah random search is not a terrible
Baseline actually actually with the way
Baseline actually actually with the way
that we've implemented it now
so we will
so we will
see how's this
going is it really just not that
good something is wrong
maybe well yeah I mean looking at it
maybe well yeah I mean looking at it
it's just it's scared to do anything
I I can just
I I can just
like mess with
the I can just like mess with the scal
the I can just like mess with the scal
of
of
stuff and try again
pong is a decent one cuz pong probably
pong is a decent one cuz pong probably
it only takes like an hour to
it only takes like an hour to
run and it's like a real like it's a

need anything just let me know you'll
need anything just let me know you'll
plan a tri for me to come
up all piping
so any other cool projects going
on
on
um I mean this has been a crazy busy
um I mean this has been a crazy busy
week I did I got GPU drive from 35k up
week I did I got GPU drive from 35k up
to 250k and got the basic hyper Prem
to 250k and got the basic hyper Prem
sweep stuff had a chat with them maybe
sweep stuff had a chat with them maybe
tomorrow I did an initial integration of
tomorrow I did an initial integration of
um intersection Zoo which is this
um intersection Zoo which is this
traffic control end for MIT we'll see
traffic control end for MIT we'll see
how they like that uh I got to go back
how they like that uh I got to go back
and forth with them that took quite a
and forth with them that took quite a
bit of work I did Isaac gym integration
bit of work I did Isaac gym integration
for a client that uh that seems to be
for a client that uh that seems to be
working
working
decently I got uh this a lot of hyper
decently I got uh this a lot of hyper
parameter sweet stuff done in puffer
parameter sweet stuff done in puffer
that's what I've been doing on science
that's what I've been doing on science
side so far and I reviewed several
side so far and I reviewed several
thousand lines of code from
thousand lines of code from
contributors out of
contributors out of
curiosity sorry
curiosity sorry
continue yeah um do you do like contract
continue yeah um do you do like contract
integration yeah it's like it's right on
integration yeah it's like it's right on
the website
the website
right well no I mean like so if let's
right well no I mean like so if let's
say I had a company and I was like ah
say I had a company and I was like ah
cool puffer lib up and coming great
cool puffer lib up and coming great
let's let's give this a world it seems
let's let's give this a world it seems
like a perfect fit can they hire you as
like a perfect fit can they hire you as
like contract to rework it for their
like contract to rework it for their
purposes and basically basically the
purposes and basically basically the
farther you take us away from the agenda
farther you take us away from the agenda
of what we're doing with puffer the more
of what we're doing with puffer the more
we
we
charge so yeah the base service package
charge so yeah the base service package
is for you have you want to use puffer
is for you have you want to use puffer
lib you're going to need a few things of
lib you're going to need a few things of
integration and you need us to like rep
integration and you need us to like rep
prioritize a couple features from 6
prioritize a couple features from 6
months from now up to next week that's
months from now up to next week that's
like the type of stuff the base package
like the type of stuff the base package
is for right extended support
is for right extended support
reprioritization of features a little
reprioritization of features a little
bit of
bit of
integration um know if you have
integration um know if you have
something that's like substantially
something that's like substantially
farther away from that that's like you
farther away from that that's like you
know farther from what we would be doing
know farther from what we would be doing
anyways we still help with it but you
anyways we still help with it but you
know we're going to charge cuz we're not
know we're going to charge cuz we're not
getting the code back to puffer lib
getting the code back to puffer lib
right CU that's like a lot of the
right CU that's like a lot of the
benefit is we continue to build out
benefit is we continue to build out
puffer so they the compass to be higher
puffer so they the compass to be higher
so the base like the base packages from
so the base like the base packages from

again it's like the more work that we
again it's like the more work that we
have to spend our time doing on that
have to spend our time doing on that
side the more the base price is going to
side the more the base price is going to
go up thus far most of what we're doing
go up thus far most of what we're doing
for clients is pretty darn close to what
for clients is pretty darn close to what
we want to do anyways with puffer just
we want to do anyways with puffer just
you know reprioritized in time frame and
you know reprioritized in time frame and
we're mostly looking for clients to do
we're mostly looking for clients to do
that at the moment um bigger contracts
that at the moment um bigger contracts
will come later but the thing is like by
will come later but the thing is like by
the time we get to later right puffer is
the time we get to later right puffer is
going to be larger and we'll probably
going to be larger and we'll probably
just cover a lot of the things that
just cover a lot of the things that
people are going to want anyways like by

carbs this is like a full new algorithm
and I bet now I think it's going to be
and I bet now I think it's going to be
pretty good and we're probably just
pretty good and we're probably just
going to have to tweak like some ranges

like we can get baselines for these

million steps is like a minute and a
