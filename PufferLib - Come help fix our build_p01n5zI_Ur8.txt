I've also just been doing the

this morning.
this morning.
pretty well done. Okay, so let me show
pretty well done. Okay, so let me show
you what I want to do now because
you what I want to do now because
doing a million things lately and there
doing a million things lately and there
it's occurred to me that there's one
it's occurred to me that there's one
like
like
relatively at least not horribly

mindbending thing that I can do that's

apparently. Well, we'll see whether this

is just hallucinated garbage, but there

should be a better way.
No build isolation package. This looks
No build isolation package. This looks
good.
But is this actually in UV

No build isolation package equals.
So then I guess
So then I guess
the question here is there's a high
the question here is there's a high
product toml and a UV toml.
What is the difference between these
What is the difference between these
two?

can you say hey something
let me see to what extent this is
the most important thing I think at the
the most important thing I think at the
moment with puffer is we need the C

We do see extensions with with

Somebody's gotten this.
Okay. So, this actually
generated.
Um,
okay.
This is kind of part of it.
This is kind of part of it.
I don't think that this works perfectly,
I don't think that this works perfectly,
right?
Yeah. So, you still end up with setup
Yeah. So, you still end up with setup
tools even with UV and setup tools
tools even with UV and setup tools
sucks, but like these other things don't

freaking work,
right?
right?
Welcome YouTube folks. I should say what
Welcome YouTube folks. I should say what
we're trying to do today to give folks a
we're trying to do today to give folks a
little bit of context. So, uh, I kind of

And like I've put a lot of time into it
And like I've put a lot of time into it
already, but like this is just so
already, but like this is just so
important that it's worth actually
important that it's worth actually
getting this right. And there kind of a
getting this right. And there kind of a
few different reasons that this stuff is
few different reasons that this stuff is
hard. So let me So first of all, if
hard. So let me So first of all, if
you're doing a pure a pure Python
you're doing a pure a pure Python

keep adding breaking changes to the

So, pretty much what I'm trying to

figure out how to do is how to wrangle

this in a way that users are going to

That's why I figured we'd stream today,

okay the best case scenario is that we
okay the best case scenario is that we
just work around this so that people
just work around this so that people
don't hit these bugs. The second best
don't hit these bugs. The second best

to do right now with you guys.
to do right now with you guys.
I have no idea what I'm doing with this

that's going to happen is we'll at least
that's going to happen is we'll at least
find like some better workaround for how

Can't help. May the force be with you.

The scikit build core just wrap setup

I want to see what this is.
Oh, that's kind of ass, isn't it?
Wait, does not use setup tool.
Wait, does not use setup tool.
They say it's glue and then they say it

Yeah. I don't want to see make
Yeah. I don't want to see make

This is worse, right?
Yeah, I really don't want freaking cm
Yeah, I really don't want freaking cm
make
if I can avoid it.
I mean, that's like enough reason to not
I mean, that's like enough reason to not
use this as is, right?
Yeah, this thing's incredibly stupid.
Okay.
You also end up having to use setup
You also end up having to use setup
tools anyways.
build Just
I think everything depends on setup. set

Like there are no alternatives to setup

What is Mason?

What is this

this? Wait, is this also
Yeah.
We don't want any build system at all is
We don't want any build system at all is

Like we basically just want freaking GCC

I mean basically all we want, right?

Well, there are a couple things. We need

But then our actual C extensions,

we literally just need GCC.
And like everybody always is trying to
And like everybody always is trying to
stick make files into everything or C
stick make files into everything or C
make files at least just like no, stop
make files at least just like no, stop

it.
Why does everybody always want to make
Why does everybody always want to make
the build system complicated as hell for
the build system complicated as hell for
no reason?
Like, oh, just one more build system,
Like, oh, just one more build system,
bro. Just one more. Just one more build
bro. Just one more. Just one more build

I think you're stuck with setup tools no
I think you're stuck with setup tools no
matter what.
Yeah, toml and setup pi.
Yeah, toml and setup pi.
So, basically stuck with what we have.
So, basically stuck with what we have.
But maybe we can do maybe we can
But maybe we can do maybe we can
basically just port chunks of this
torch. What do you mean the lid torch?
Oh, that's Jason. Sadly, I don't know
Oh, that's Jason. Sadly, I don't know
enough about Python.
enough about Python.
So, Tim, it's just like various build
So, Tim, it's just like various build
issues where people not being able to
issues where people not being able to
install easily because of uh things that
install easily because of uh things that
have to do with how we build extensions
have to do with how we build extensions
and setup tools versions and
and setup tools versions and
dependencies things.
I think probably
I got to go figure out between a UV file
I got to go figure out between a UV file
and uh
and uh
else. So,
else. So,
don't do this.
Look, UV docs.
it come. Yes, it is.
it come. Yes, it is.
So, right now we only ship
So, right now we only ship
basically we don't ship the pre-built
basically we don't ship the pre-built
CUDA, right? We just ship the source and
CUDA, right? We just ship the source and
then the package builds it on your
then the package builds it on your
system. Um because I really really don't
system. Um because I really really don't
want to have to ship our own CUDA
want to have to ship our own CUDA
kernels like our pre-built ones.
kernels like our pre-built ones.
Technically, if I have to down the line,
Technically, if I have to down the line,
we can do that. But that's like it is a
we can do that. But that's like it is a
massive massive pain in the ass to ship
massive massive pain in the ass to ship
a pre-built Cuda.
Like technically, right, we could just
Like technically, right, we could just
ship binaries for everything and then
ship binaries for everything and then
like everything would work instantly. I
like everything would work instantly. I
don't think I'm ready to do that though
don't think I'm ready to do that though
because like
because like
having a having a way to ship binaries
having a having a way to ship binaries
on something that includes CUDA is just
on something that includes CUDA is just
horrible. If I didn't have any CUDA, I
horrible. If I didn't have any CUDA, I
think it would relatively okay.
Okay. Okay. So, we have this
Okay.
UV decks.
UV decks.
Maybe this.
Okay. So I guess we can try this stuff,
Okay. So I guess we can try this stuff,
right?
Let me understand um their UV toml
Let me understand um their UV toml
versus pi project toml.
Okay. So, I don't think we need this
Okay. So, I don't think we need this
unless is there anything.
Yeah. So, it doesn't even make a UV toml
Yeah. So, it doesn't even make a UV toml
by default. It just does uh a pi project
by default. It just does uh a pi project
tunnel.
Okay. So these add and remove are just
Okay. So these add and remove are just
like these straight up don't do
like these straight up don't do
anything, right? They just edit the
anything, right? They just edit the
toml.
Yeah. So this is like a poetry.
You don't want a lock file, right? This
You don't want a lock file, right? This
is like poetry style and lock file means
is like poetry style and lock file means
can't use package with anything because
can't use package with anything because
everything is pinned.
I mean I guess it is kind of like a
I mean I guess it is kind of like a
lightweight docker in a sense, right?
That's kind of like a weird in between
That's kind of like a weird in between
to me though. like pin all the packages
to me though. like pin all the packages
but not Docker is like it's kind of like
but not Docker is like it's kind of like
eh I really don't want things to go
eh I really don't want things to go
wrong but I don't like I don't actually
wrong but I don't like I don't actually
care enough to make sure things don't go
care enough to make sure things don't go
wrong. The docker makes sure things
wrong. The docker makes sure things
don't go wrong.
Okay. So,
Okay. So,
I think we just need like move some
I think we just need like move some
stuff.
I think like ultimately
just do something like this.
See what we can do with this.
We have our camel here.
We don't have a UV section at all.
We can do like tool.uv
We can do like tool.uv

Oh, hang on before I do this.

Is it UV pip install or is it UV build?

What is it?
Or is it you pipe?
Use UV to set the VN source. It then

Yeah, but like

I want to see what this is.
Oh, that's kind of ass, isn't it?
Wait, does not use setup tool.

This is worse, right?
Yeah, I really don't want freaking cm

I mean, that's like enough reason to not

Yeah, this thing's incredibly stupid.
Okay.
You also end up having to use setup
You also end up having to use setup

We don't want any build system at all is

we literally just need GCC.

stick make files into everything or C
stick make files into everything or C
make files at least just like no, stop

Why does everybody always want to make
Why does everybody always want to make
the build system complicated as hell for
the build system complicated as hell for
no reason?
Like, oh, just one more build system,

bro. Just one more. Just one more build
bro. Just one more. Just one more build

I think you're stuck with setup tools no
I think you're stuck with setup tools no
matter what.
Yeah, toml and setup pi.
Yeah, toml and setup pi.
So, basically stuck with what we have.
So, basically stuck with what we have.
But maybe we can do maybe we can

basically just port chunks of this
torch. What do you mean the lid torch?
Oh, that's Jason. Sadly, I don't know
Oh, that's Jason. Sadly, I don't know
enough about Python.
enough about Python.
So, Tim, it's just like various build
So, Tim, it's just like various build
issues where people not being able to
issues where people not being able to
install easily because of uh things that
install easily because of uh things that
have to do with how we build extensions
have to do with how we build extensions
and setup tools versions and
and setup tools versions and
dependencies things.
I think probably
I got to go figure out between a UV file
I got to go figure out between a UV file
and uh
and uh
else. So,
else. So,
don't do this.
Look, UV docs.
it come. Yes, it is.
it come. Yes, it is.
So, right now we only ship
So, right now we only ship
basically we don't ship the pre-built
basically we don't ship the pre-built
CUDA, right? We just ship the source and
CUDA, right? We just ship the source and
then the package builds it on your
then the package builds it on your
system. Um because I really really don't
system. Um because I really really don't
want to have to ship our own CUDA
want to have to ship our own CUDA
kernels like our pre-built ones.
kernels like our pre-built ones.
Technically, if I have to down the line,
Technically, if I have to down the line,
we can do that. But that's like it is a
we can do that. But that's like it is a
massive massive pain in the ass to ship
massive massive pain in the ass to ship
a pre-built Cuda.
Like technically, right, we could just
Like technically, right, we could just
ship binaries for everything and then
ship binaries for everything and then
like everything would work instantly. I
like everything would work instantly. I
don't think I'm ready to do that though
don't think I'm ready to do that though
because like
because like
having a having a way to ship binaries
having a having a way to ship binaries
on something that includes CUDA is just
on something that includes CUDA is just
horrible. If I didn't have any CUDA, I
horrible. If I didn't have any CUDA, I
think it would relatively okay.
Okay. Okay. So, we have this
Okay.
UV decks.
UV decks.
Maybe this.
Okay. So I guess we can try this stuff,
Okay. So I guess we can try this stuff,
right?
Let me understand um their UV toml
Let me understand um their UV toml
versus pi project toml.
Okay. So, I don't think we need this
Okay. So, I don't think we need this
unless is there anything.
Yeah. So, it doesn't even make a UV toml
Yeah. So, it doesn't even make a UV toml
by default. It just does uh a pi project
by default. It just does uh a pi project
tunnel.
Okay. So these add and remove are just
Okay. So these add and remove are just
like these straight up don't do
like these straight up don't do
anything, right? They just edit the
anything, right? They just edit the
toml.
Yeah. So this is like a poetry.
You don't want a lock file, right? This
You don't want a lock file, right? This
is like poetry style and lock file means
is like poetry style and lock file means
can't use package with anything because
can't use package with anything because
everything is pinned.
I mean I guess it is kind of like a
I mean I guess it is kind of like a
lightweight docker in a sense, right?
That's kind of like a weird in between
That's kind of like a weird in between
to me though. like pin all the packages
to me though. like pin all the packages
but not Docker is like it's kind of like
but not Docker is like it's kind of like
eh I really don't want things to go
eh I really don't want things to go
wrong but I don't like I don't actually
wrong but I don't like I don't actually
care enough to make sure things don't go
care enough to make sure things don't go
wrong. The docker makes sure things
wrong. The docker makes sure things
don't go wrong.
Okay. So,
Okay. So,
I think we just need like move some
I think we just need like move some
stuff.
I think like ultimately
just do something like this.
See what we can do with this.
We have our camel here.
We don't have a UV section at all.
We can do like tool.uv
We can do like tool.uv

Is it UV pip install or is it UV build?

Use UV to set the VN source. It then
