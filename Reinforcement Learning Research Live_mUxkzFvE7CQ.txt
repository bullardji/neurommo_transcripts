Good morning.
Back live.
Hi.
Hi.
So, um,
So, um,
plan for today.
I'm going to write a little bit on that
I'm going to write a little bit on that
article,
article,
check a couple of experiments, do a
check a couple of experiments, do a
couple small things. Uh, I am getting
couple small things. Uh, I am getting
ready to
ready to
head out of here, spend a few days in
head out of here, spend a few days in
Florida, and then go to Palo Alto.
Florida, and then go to Palo Alto.
So, uh, pretty much the main thing over
So, uh, pretty much the main thing over
the next few weeks, got a couple
the next few weeks, got a couple
articles to put out. I've got a few
articles to put out. I've got a few
things to make sure we're working on our
things to make sure we're working on our
servers. have a few different research
servers. have a few different research
projects that we're
projects that we're
in a good spot with.
in a good spot with.
And uh we will uh so yeah, we'll we'll
And uh we will uh so yeah, we'll we'll
have like probably a pretty chill
have like probably a pretty chill
bit of time, but I still want to keep
bit of time, but I still want to keep
streaming and I still want to like go
streaming and I still want to like go
off some of the things I'm working on
off some of the things I'm working on
here. Let me grab this.
We had a little bit of an interesting
We had a little bit of an interesting
morning here,
I guess. uh that got seen finally saw
I guess. uh that got seen finally saw
some of the RL stuff. I know he's been
some of the RL stuff. I know he's been
like doing RL things here and there and
like doing RL things here and there and
uh he saw some of the recent stuff. So,
uh he saw some of the recent stuff. So,
uh yeah, thanks for the uh the
uh yeah, thanks for the uh the
endorsement, man.
endorsement, man.
It's a very nice bit of growth.
It's a very nice bit of growth.
Welcome, Mag.
All right, so here's what we are uh
All right, so here's what we are uh
we're going to do. I am pull up a reream
we're going to do. I am pull up a reream
first of all.
first of all.
And I think we're going to check the
And I think we're going to check the
experiments
experiments
just to see if I I did anything. I kind
just to see if I I did anything. I kind
of forget if I had stuff running. I
of forget if I had stuff running. I
think I had like a neural MMO run going.
think I had like a neural MMO run going.
And then after that
after that we'll get writing a bit.
This is still live.
Okay. So, I guess we'll see if this is
Okay. So, I guess we'll see if this is
more stable.
more stable.
Uh, basically, I reduced the learning
Uh, basically, I reduced the learning
rate. And it doesn't look like that
rate. And it doesn't look like that
changed literally anything.
changed literally anything.
Like, they're basically the same exact
Like, they're basically the same exact
thing. And we'll see if this crashes or
thing. And we'll see if this crashes or
not.
not.
I guess there is. If we look at this
I guess there is. If we look at this
right here,
right here,
there's like a very very slight
there's like a very very slight
difference in perf, but it's almost
difference in perf, but it's almost
negligible.
negligible.
Yeah, that's got to be like negligible,
Yeah, that's got to be like negligible,
right? I guess it kind of slows. No, you
right? I guess it kind of slows. No, you
know, there is a difference. So, with
know, there is a difference. So, with
the lower learning rate, look at this.
the lower learning rate, look at this.
You see that?
You see that?
It actually doesn't do anything
It actually doesn't do anything
for 10 billion steps.
for 10 billion steps.
Isn't that funny?
So, it just does flat and then this.
So, it just does flat and then this.
That's kind of cursed.
Well, we'll see if it's stable or not.
Well, we'll see if it's stable or not.
And we'll see if this like jumps up or
And we'll see if this like jumps up or
not. Whatever.
But yeah, it's only 640 bill that it's
But yeah, it's only 640 bill that it's
supposed to run for, right?
supposed to run for, right?
That's a soda mo model either way.
That's a soda mo model either way.
Okay, I'm good with that for now.
I got all sorts of people messaging me
I got all sorts of people messaging me
now from uh
now from uh
those tweets.
Do I even have Hang on.
Let me let me set a couple quick things
Let me let me set a couple quick things
up so that I can actually reply to stuff
up so that I can actually reply to stuff
effectively throughout the day. And then
effectively throughout the day. And then
I think what we're going to do is we're
I think what we're going to do is we're
going to write on the quick start guide
going to write on the quick start guide
a little bit today. So, if you guys are
a little bit today. So, if you guys are
interested in helping uh shape
interested in helping uh shape
the learning material that I'm putting
the learning material that I'm putting
out because I don't do a ton of this
out because I don't do a ton of this
content. I really don't do a ton of
content. I really don't do a ton of
educational content. So, if you want to
educational content. So, if you want to
help shape this little bit and make it
help shape this little bit and make it
as useful as possible to you, you'll be
as useful as possible to you, you'll be
able to do that today.
Welcome major. Yeah.
I just have to enter one one thing here
I just have to enter one one thing here
guys and I'll get started.
Captures.
All
right.
Cool. So, uh, let me see if there's any
Cool. So, uh, let me see if there's any
of It's like because there's like this
of It's like because there's like this
massive blow up now that I'm just
massive blow up now that I'm just
getting because of all of the, uh, the
getting because of all of the, uh, the
new stuff, which is Good.
I got yet seen looking through hyper
I got yet seen looking through hyper
pram stuff as well.
All
right. I I did not intend to just like
right. I I did not intend to just like
start stream and be handling DMs, but
start stream and be handling DMs, but
let me at least like
let me at least like
it would be cool to have him uh doing
it would be cool to have him uh doing
some drone stuff around with us. It
some drone stuff around with us. It
would be fun.
All
right.
right.
People are noticing has been looking for
People are noticing has been looking for
cool projects for a while. Yeah, man. I
cool projects for a while. Yeah, man. I
hope so.
hope so.
It It definitely helps. It's like It's
It It definitely helps. It's like It's
very cool because we get more open
very cool because we get more open
source stuff. we help the clients and
source stuff. we help the clients and
also it does actually generate us like
also it does actually generate us like
additional inbounds on clients as well
additional inbounds on clients as well
which which helps because I would like
which which helps because I would like
to make this thing uh like a larger
to make this thing uh like a larger
private lab so we can get more servers
private lab so we can get more servers
and fund more stuff.
Okay. So, where we left this off,
where we left this thing off, I think I
where we left this thing off, I think I
was five sections through.
Yeah, five sections through.
I'm trying to think how I want to
I'm trying to think how I want to
position this.
position this.
So,
So,
for new people here, does this sort of
for new people here, does this sort of
plan
plan
make sense or is there uh stuff you'd
make sense or is there uh stuff you'd
want to see in here that's different?
want to see in here that's different?
So, quick summary.
So, quick summary.
advice so far. And this is linked to all
advice so far. And this is linked to all
sorts of articles in here.
sorts of articles in here.
Super basic intro that has you build the
Super basic intro that has you build the
simplest possible working thing.
simplest possible working thing.
Some pretty accessible fundamentals.
A still pretty dang simple but at least
A still pretty dang simple but at least
kind of cool environment that you build.
kind of cool environment that you build.
start feeding in a little bit of the
start feeding in a little bit of the
fundamental knowledge, some stuff about
fundamental knowledge, some stuff about
how our infrastructure works, some stuff
how our infrastructure works, some stuff
about general RL, and then by here
about general RL, and then by here
you're doing like a real Contact.
Sounds good so far.
Little the cobwebs out of my head a
Little the cobwebs out of my head a
little bit here.
I have like multiple DM threads that I
I have like multiple DM threads that I
was expecting to like calm down.
was expecting to like calm down.
Whatever. So, puffer algo article.
Whatever. So, puffer algo article.
Let's go grab these. Let me see. What
Let's go grab these. Let me see. What
did I actually write? because I have
did I actually write? because I have
like a few different things.
feel like.
I think this is the main. Are there any
I think this is the main. Are there any
of these that I want to link otherwise?
Yeah, that take is kind of dated.
Where's the 3 article?
Oh, there isn't a three. It's just Yeah.
Oh, there isn't a three. It's just Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
It was the trailer. Cool. That's fine.
These two are the same. That's why I've
These two are the same. That's why I've
been confused and stuck here cuz it
been confused and stuck here cuz it
doesn't make any sense.
Right.
Yeah, this is like
I I honestly think that these last ones
I I honestly think that these last ones
I kind of just wrote these at the end of
I kind of just wrote these at the end of
the stream and uh they don't like the
the stream and uh they don't like the
ordering and the sequencing isn't good.
ordering and the sequencing isn't good.
I think this is fine.
We have you build something. That's
We have you build something. That's
cool. We give you a very accessible blog
cool. We give you a very accessible blog
post. It's a pretty short read.
Make you read a little bit of code and
Make you read a little bit of code and
build some more stuff.
Yeah, my sequencing is totally off.
I think that we don't give them this
I think that we don't give them this
infrastructure here.
infrastructure here.
I think I move this down
I think I move this down
and I give these articles
and I give these articles
here.
Okay.
Okay.
You know, I
You know, I
I don't like that I'm giving people the
I don't like that I'm giving people the
PO paper this early. Almost, right? I'm
PO paper this early. Almost, right? I'm
kind of stuck,
kind of stuck,
actually. Let me ask you guys about
actually. Let me ask you guys about
this. Okay. Let me let me ask you guys
this. Okay. Let me let me ask you guys
about this. What What do you do about
about this. What What do you do about
this? Okay, so I've linked a couple blog
this? Okay, so I've linked a couple blog
posts at this point, even just one that
posts at this point, even just one that
aren't mine. Like I linked Carpathy's
aren't mine. Like I linked Carpathy's
post, right? But pretty much the rest of
post, right? But pretty much the rest of
all this material comes from me.
all this material comes from me.
So
So
like I don't want to make the guide just
like I don't want to make the guide just
like, hey, read all of my other stuff
like, hey, read all of my other stuff
and you're good, right?
and you're good, right?
Like I want to link you to external
Like I want to link you to external
formal resources. But the problem is my
formal resources. But the problem is my
stuff is literally way easier to
stuff is literally way easier to
understand than everything else that's
understand than everything else that's
out there. Okay? Like let me show you
out there. Okay? Like let me show you
the difference.
the difference.
This is my where's my description of PO.
This is my where's my description of PO.
Okay? I just say yeah this is just
Okay? I just say yeah this is just
vanilla policy gradient with general
vanilla policy gradient with general
generalized advantage estimation which
generalized advantage estimation which
is just a fancy exponential reward
is just a fancy exponential reward
discounting with a value function
discounting with a value function
baseline and it adds policy clipping.
baseline and it adds policy clipping.
Like I give you like a three sentence
Like I give you like a three sentence
description that's like this is what PO
description that's like this is what PO
is and how it works for the most part.
is and how it works for the most part.
All right? And that's like 80%
All right? And that's like 80%
of the actual intuition behind the
of the actual intuition behind the
algorithm is these three or four
algorithm is these three or four
sentences. And if you actually look, I
sentences. And if you actually look, I
have more detailed content on my
have more detailed content on my
algorithms and stuff. But then the
algorithms and stuff. But then the
problem is as soon as I link you
to like an actual formal paper, okay,
to like an actual formal paper, okay,
this is the difference.
this is the difference.
They're going to hit you with all this
They're going to hit you with all this
crap.
crap.
All right? And the thing is when I read
All right? And the thing is when I read
this, like I know that none of this
this, like I know that none of this
even matters. Like this doesn't even
even matters. Like this doesn't even
matter. You can ignore this. This is
matter. You can ignore this. This is
just a poorly written version of a
just a poorly written version of a
different formula. And then this is like
different formula. And then this is like
this is like using fancy math to explain
this is like using fancy math to explain
something that is basically two
something that is basically two
sentences in plain English with exactly
sentences in plain English with exactly
the same meaning. Like
I don't want to like confuse the hell
I don't want to like confuse the hell
out of new people to RL because some
out of new people to RL because some
people are going to come in with a math
people are going to come in with a math
background where yeah this is easy and
background where yeah this is easy and
some people are going to be like what
some people are going to be like what
the hell is this?
the hell is this?
And the thing is you do not need to
And the thing is you do not need to
understand this to understand the RL. So
understand this to understand the RL. So
I don't actually know what to do with it
I don't actually know what to do with it
can be referred to the materials.
can be referred to the materials.
Yeah, exactly. So but Spencer, this is
Yeah, exactly. So but Spencer, this is
this is kind of my goal here is to And
this is kind of my goal here is to And
also, hey, how's it going? I hope you're
also, hey, how's it going? I hope you're
doing all right with the Texas floods. I
doing all right with the Texas floods. I
don't know if those are anywhere near
don't know if those are anywhere near
you. Um,
I pretty much like I'm trying to drip
I pretty much like I'm trying to drip
feed in content,
feed in content,
but like I don't want people to say
but like I don't want people to say
like, "Ah, don't worry about it. You
like, "Ah, don't worry about it. You
don't need to learn it." You do need to
don't need to learn it." You do need to
learn the stuff at some point, but like
learn the stuff at some point, but like
I kind of want to make sure that people
I kind of want to make sure that people
have already seen, okay, I can build
have already seen, okay, I can build
some I already can build awesome stuff.
some I already can build awesome stuff.
Now, let me maybe go to learn some of
Now, let me maybe go to learn some of
the formalism.
the formalism.
Um,
it's tricky to balance those two things.
Also, I got us a bunch of cool inbound,
Also, I got us a bunch of cool inbound,
so working on that.
We're at
We're at
82 as well.
in moving.
in moving.
I'm building much more educational and
I'm building much more educational and
so do I.
It's a little tough though because like
A lot of the questions that you ask,
A lot of the questions that you ask,
right, the thing is like, okay, how do I
right, the thing is like, okay, how do I
magically know the answer to everything,
magically know the answer to everything,
right?
It's because I actually h like I
It's because I actually h like I
understand the actual fundamentals,
understand the actual fundamentals,
right?
Stuff should be referenced.
Stuff should be referenced.
I have that in the quick start guide.
I have that in the quick start guide.
I'm kind of trying to give people an
I'm kind of trying to give people an
order like instead of like reference
order like instead of like reference
this, reference that, I'm trying to give
this, reference that, I'm trying to give
people a very like a pretty script, a
people a very like a pretty script, a
pretty strict prescribed do this, do
pretty strict prescribed do this, do
this, do this, read this, do this, read
this, do this, read this, do this, read
that. Now you know RL, congratulations.
Okay, let me see if I can put it further
Okay, let me see if I can put it further
down at least.
The problem is I like I don't like that
The problem is I like I don't like that
we have no references
we have no references
like outside of carpath is blog.
Let me see how self-contained this is.
the CS classes aren't going to help with
the CS classes aren't going to help with
the papers.
The thing is the main the main
The thing is the main the main
algorithmic paper it looks like this
also this
and this
like relative to how simple the idea is.
like relative to how simple the idea is.
It's a super dense paper. Like actually,
It's a super dense paper. Like actually,
as far as RL papers go, this isn't even
as far as RL papers go, this isn't even
that bad. But like relative to how
that bad. But like relative to how
utterly simple
utterly simple
the poor algorithm is.
the poor algorithm is.
Like this is a lot.
Like I don't want to link people that.
Like I don't want to link people that.
But the thing is I can't
But the thing is I can't
I can't link you the article.
like our followup to PO without PO.
I don't think anybody has a good blog
I don't think anybody has a good blog
post on PO either.
Do I need to make one? I really don't
Do I need to make one? I really don't
want to.
Let me see if I can link people a
Let me see if I can link people a
section of it or I can at least tell
section of it or I can at least tell
people how to read it in a way that's
people how to read it in a way that's
not going to be this painful cuz I think
not going to be this painful cuz I think
you do need to at least see where like
you do need to at least see where like
that there like this exists but I think
that there like this exists but I think
you need to not suffer.
This is a difficult thing to do.
It's tough here. It is really tough.
There's the thing is fundamentally
There's the thing is fundamentally
there's no way you can genuinely
there's no way you can genuinely
understand RL without being able to
understand RL without being able to
interact with the literature.
What?
What?
Yeah, there's an im there's a difference
Yeah, there's an im there's a difference
between an avocado and a hand gun as
between an avocado and a hand gun as
well. What's your point?
Okay. What is the optimal point to start
Okay. What is the optimal point to start
interacting with the literature?
built a couple small projects.
built a couple small projects.
The thing is custom networks is not even
The thing is custom networks is not even
in this.
in this.
So custom networks is covered by the
So custom networks is covered by the
background material like CS231N. You
background material like CS231N. You
should know how to build custom
should know how to build custom
networks.
It's definitely at least after you've
It's definitely at least after you've
built like one substantial project.
I think I just need to prefix it with
I think I just need to prefix it with
some stuff.
I think I need to give him the PO paper
I think I need to give him the PO paper
relatively early, but with the caveat
relatively early, but with the caveat
that like
that like
the paper's a lot simpler than what is
the paper's a lot simpler than what is
actually presented.
Set a timer cuz I got a meeting.
Try to get it done before then.
Hey, boxing. What are we trying to do
Hey, boxing. What are we trying to do
here? So, I'm trying to figure out how I
here? So, I'm trying to figure out how I
can make this article
can make this article
actually good for people learning RL.
The point is to understand PPO. I don't
The point is to understand PPO. I don't
think you can avoid back and forth.
think you can avoid back and forth.
Yeah, exactly.
The thing is it's like you can't really
The thing is it's like you can't really
implement PO
implement PO
like implementing PO is not a short
like implementing PO is not a short
exercise because like the very small
exercise because like the very small
details for which there isn't really any
details for which there isn't really any
theoretical basis matter a lot in terms
theoretical basis matter a lot in terms
of whether it's actually going to work
of whether it's actually going to work
or not.
I don't feel there's a place where they
I don't feel there's a place where they
distilled the high into it. Yeah,
distilled the high into it. Yeah,
exactly.
It's clipped. It's clipped. It's clipped
It's clipped. It's clipped. It's clipped
updates on policy gradients so that you
updates on policy gradients so that you
don't go too far off policy.
don't go too far off policy.
The generalized advantage estimation is
The generalized advantage estimation is
a better as a better form of reward
a better as a better form of reward
discounting than bullet
This help.
Okay, I think this is okay.
We give you a build section.
We give you a build section.
This is like a few hours worth of
This is like a few hours worth of
reading.
And then I think you kind of have the
And then I think you kind of have the
background to do something.
background to do something.
quite a bit more substantial and you
quite a bit more substantial and you
should hopefully have enough intuition
should hopefully have enough intuition
not totally mess stuff up
the rest of my quick start guide
very relieving actually I opened PO saw
very relieving actually I opened PO saw
the equation was like oh okay much more
the equation was like oh okay much more
adequate yeah so this is the problem max
adequate yeah so this is the problem max
and I'm trying to make this guide
and I'm trying to make this guide
actually pretty well just ex like just
actually pretty well just ex like just
for you in this sense. Um
for you in this sense. Um
like it's exactly for you in that case
like it's exactly for you in that case
cuz like this type of stuff sucks and
cuz like this type of stuff sucks and
like I know what this is because I've
like I know what this is because I've
seen this specific notation and this
seen this specific notation and this
specific equation a bunch of times but
specific equation a bunch of times but
if I open a random RL paper that has
if I open a random RL paper that has
like even the exact same thing or
like even the exact same thing or
something very similar in a different
something very similar in a different
notation, it will take me a couple hours
notation, it will take me a couple hours
to figure out what they're saying. Uh
to figure out what they're saying. Uh
sometimes it's because the math is
sometimes it's because the math is
actually very precise and very helpful
actually very precise and very helpful
and it's just complicated. But most of
and it's just complicated. But most of
the time it's just because researchers
the time it's just because researchers
like writing math for the sake of
like writing math for the sake of
writing math.
The actual math that you need to know.
The actual math that you need to know.
Okay. So it helps to be able to
Okay. So it helps to be able to
understand notation enough such that if
understand notation enough such that if
you spend a couple hours you can figure
you spend a couple hours you can figure
out what they're actually trying to do
out what they're actually trying to do
with all the math, right? Like that is
with all the math, right? Like that is
helpful.
helpful.
Um, but outside of that,
Um, but outside of that,
the knowledge you need for RL is the
the knowledge you need for RL is the
same as the knowledge you need just to
same as the knowledge you need just to
understand the fundamentals of deep
understand the fundamentals of deep
learning in general. Need to know what a
learning in general. Need to know what a
partial derivative is. Need to know what
partial derivative is. Need to know what
a matrix is. That's it.
able
to understand all the mathy stuff for
to understand all the mathy stuff for
sure at some point but not starting
sure at some point but not starting
point. The thing is you actually can
point. The thing is you actually can
build some crazy cool RL stuff before
build some crazy cool RL stuff before
you even understand it. Um the thing is
you even understand it. Um the thing is
it the point of really getting into the
it the point of really getting into the
RL literature is if you want to actually
RL literature is if you want to actually
help us advance the core algorithmic
help us advance the core algorithmic
research that's the like that is the
research that's the like that is the
point at which you really need to
point at which you really need to
understand this stuff it helps generally
understand this stuff it helps generally
and like I don't know if you watch me
and like I don't know if you watch me
debugging people's stuff in
debugging people's stuff in
reinforcement learning like we'll always
reinforcement learning like we'll always
have contributors that'll show me a
have contributors that'll show me a
thing and I'll just go like oh yeah do
thing and I'll just go like oh yeah do
this and and it'll instantly work. That
this and and it'll instantly work. That
comes from a very strong grasp of
comes from a very strong grasp of
fundamentals plus years of practical
fundamentals plus years of practical
experience. But like you do need it
experience. But like you do need it
eventually, but like I don't write stuff
eventually, but like I don't write stuff
this way, right? I do not write this
this way, right? I do not write this
type of stuff. I will write the exact
type of stuff. I will write the exact
same content, the exact same
same content, the exact same
information, but not like this if I can
information, but not like this if I can
avoid it.
avoid it.
The one exception I did do this for the
The one exception I did do this for the
protein blog post but that was because I
protein blog post but that was because I
was directly referencing another very
was directly referencing another very
heavy mathematical work. So like I did
heavy mathematical work. So like I did
this
this
I did this thing right
I did this thing right
this is the background on the algorithm
this is the background on the algorithm
and then I said okay this is our new
and then I said okay this is our new

Okay.
Okay.
So, that's the first five.
So, that's the first five.
started with five sections done and we
started with five sections done and we
have five slightly better sections done.
have five slightly better sections done.
I guess we have this paragraph as well
I guess we have this paragraph as well
that we're left over with.
But once people have done a project,
research applications, infrastructure,
research applications, infrastructure,
right? Are going to be three of them.
I can make the last three sections a
I can make the last three sections a
choose your own adventure.
Me grab more coffee real quick. So, I
Me grab more coffee real quick. So, I
know the last three sections are going
know the last three sections are going
to be advanced infrastructure,
to be advanced infrastructure,
um, going to be advanced
um, going to be advanced
research, like how to actually get into
research, like how to actually get into

and then applications.
and then applications.
Oh, we have a fair few folks on YouTube
Oh, we have a fair few folks on YouTube
today. Welcome everybody.
today. Welcome everybody.
Uh yeah, if you guys are actually new or
Uh yeah, if you guys are actually new or
relatively new to RL and you have ideas
relatively new to RL and you have ideas
on things that you would like to see
on things that you would like to see
presented in this guide, that's why I'm
presented in this guide, that's why I'm
streaming writing. Like I wouldn't be
streaming writing. Like I wouldn't be
streaming writing otherwise, right?
streaming writing otherwise, right?
So please tell me that's why I'm
So please tell me that's why I'm
streaming it. Let me get coffee.
The YouTube chat is working, right?
The YouTube chat is working, right?
Because I don't think I've seen a single
Because I don't think I've seen a single
message from YouTube.
Go test that real quick.
Oh, it's not uh it's not working.
Wait, what?
There's a message that just didn't show
There's a message that just didn't show
up.
Starang.
Starang.
I don't know why it does that.
Now it shows up. Oh, was it just now?
Now it shows up. Oh, was it just now?
Okay.
I read the TRPO one and it is intuitive
I read the TRPO one and it is intuitive
if you've done convex opt. Okay. Yeah,
if you've done convex opt. Okay. Yeah,
but here's the thing. like if you've
but here's the thing. like if you've
done convex opt then I don't have to
done convex opt then I don't have to
worry about the math side at all and I
worry about the math side at all and I
can just tell you go read all these
can just tell you go read all these
papers right and then the thing that we
papers right and then the thing that we
have to figure out is the engineering
have to figure out is the engineering
side
side
I'm writing a guide that's like people
I'm writing a guide that's like people
start at different points right a lot of
start at different points right a lot of
people are going to know either
people are going to know either
engineering or math but not both
teach us RL from basics to advance
teach us RL from basics to advance
Yeah, but what's that mean? Sarang,
Yeah, but what's that mean? Sarang,
right? Like that's what I'm trying to
right? Like that's what I'm trying to
figure out like what gaps I'm missing
figure out like what gaps I'm missing
and stuff. People have not done convex
and stuff. People have not done convex
opt. Oh, I have a fun story about that.
opt. Oh, I have a fun story about that.
So, when I got to Stanford, they uh they
So, when I got to Stanford, they uh they
brought us all into, you know, a big
brought us all into, you know, a big
auditorium and the president gave us
auditorium and the president gave us
this like long- winded speech about how
this like long- winded speech about how
uh Stanford students don't know how to
uh Stanford students don't know how to
fail, right? like you guys have never
fail, right? like you guys have never
failed at anything and you don't know
failed at anything and you don't know
what that's like. So I I took that as a
what that's like. So I I took that as a
challenge. So uh my winter semester I
challenge. So uh my winter semester I
enrolled in a full course load uh plus
enrolled in a full course load uh plus
two graduate courses upper div graduate
two graduate courses upper div graduate
courses one of which was convex
courses one of which was convex
optimization with Steven Boyd which is a
optimization with Steven Boyd which is a
notoriously hard class that has a
notoriously hard class that has a
24-hour long final. The final is written
24-hour long final. The final is written
to take you 24 hours and you have 24
to take you 24 hours and you have 24
hours to do it.
hours to do it.
So yeah, I did not pass that class. Uh,
So yeah, I did not pass that class. Uh,
no, there was not a snowballs chance in
no, there was not a snowballs chance in
hell, but I did learn a bunch of cool
hell, but I did learn a bunch of cool
stuff from it.
Engineering is important. Math can be
Engineering is important. Math can be
done by people like you. I'm not a good
done by people like you. I'm not a good
mathematician at all,
bro.
It was fun. I had a good time with that.
I took the 24hour final right as well. I
I took the 24hour final right as well. I
think I might have gotten like one
think I might have gotten like one
question mostly correct.
It's actually one of my favorite classes
It's actually one of my favorite classes
though because like
though because like
the one thing I learned from convex opt
the one thing I learned from convex opt
that was really useful uh Steven Boyd
that was really useful uh Steven Boyd
gave a great introduction to parto
gave a great introduction to parto
optimality and sensitivity analysis and
optimality and sensitivity analysis and
I have used that everywhere ever since.
I have used that everywhere ever since.
It was like the one really accessible
It was like the one really accessible
piece of that course.
also the problem with like the problem
also the problem with like the problem
with getting too theoretical about a lot
with getting too theoretical about a lot
of this stuff, right, is you write this
of this stuff, right, is you write this
beautiful formula for constrained
beautiful formula for constrained
optimization with TRPO or whatever and
optimization with TRPO or whatever and
then it just doesn't work,
then it just doesn't work,
right? It just doesn't work.
I remember that course was so funny.
I remember that course was so funny.
Boyd said um he said that he used to
Boyd said um he said that he used to
make his final open book and open other
make his final open book and open other
professors. So you used to be able to go
professors. So you used to be able to go
ask other professors for help with his
ask other professors for help with his
final. And he said that he did this to
final. And he said that he did this to
screw with other professors because they
screw with other professors because they
could not take his exam.
This is the reason I lean towards
This is the reason I lean towards
heavier engineering is because basically
heavier engineering is because basically
I was very practical with like all right
I was very practical with like all right
what is the thing I need to know in
what is the thing I need to know in
order to make the thing I want to work
order to make the thing I want to work
work and it was mostly engineering.
work and it was mostly engineering.
At the time I finished his course, I
At the time I finished his course, I
thought SGD was trash and Newton's
thought SGD was trash and Newton's
method is the way to go. Yeah. You know,
method is the way to go. Yeah. You know,
and then like I spent the next several
and then like I spent the next several
years thinking that all optimization
years thinking that all optimization
research was kind of just trolling
research was kind of just trolling
because really not much came out of
because really not much came out of
optimization research for a long time,
optimization research for a long time,
but then Muan came out of left field and
but then Muan came out of left field and
ended up being a huge huge improvement
ended up being a huge huge improvement
for RRL stuff. So like there's actually
for RRL stuff. So like there's actually
legitimate stuff in uh optimizer
legitimate stuff in uh optimizer
research.
You just can't have anything that's like
You just can't have anything that's like
quadratic or n login in um in terms of
quadratic or n login in um in terms of
the number of weights cuz like obviously
the number of weights cuz like obviously
right
Did you take his course at Stanford out
Did you take his course at Stanford out
of curiosity
where I did my undergrad?
I don't know if it's also online.
off to debug poly touring machine. Good
off to debug poly touring machine. Good
luck with that. Holy, I think that's a
luck with that. Holy, I think that's a
new record. We have that's at least 15
new record. We have that's at least 15
people on the stream. Hey everyone,
people on the stream. Hey everyone,
welcome.
welcome.
We are uh
We are uh
trying to finish this guide today so
trying to finish this guide today so
that you all will actually have
that you all will actually have
educational material on RL. I don't do a
educational material on RL. I don't do a
ton of educational material, but it's
ton of educational material, but it's
been highly highly requested. So, I'm
been highly highly requested. So, I'm
trying my best here.
We're kind of uniquely positioned where
We're kind of uniquely positioned where
like
like
RL's actually really easy to get into
RL's actually really easy to get into
with Puffer, but then bridging the gap
with Puffer, but then bridging the gap
between how easy it is in Puffer versus
between how easy it is in Puffer versus
like how you interact with everything
like how you interact with everything
outside of Puffer is kind of hard.
outside of Puffer is kind of hard.
Welcome, Grant.
Welcome, Grant.
Can you give us a glimpse of a prequel
Can you give us a glimpse of a prequel
article just to Yeah. So,
article just to Yeah. So,
there are a few of them.
There are if you look on the docs here
There are if you look on the docs here
or the blog
or the blog
there's this quick start guide which
there's this quick start guide which
just has fundamental terms some
just has fundamental terms some
perspective and some things that I use a
perspective and some things that I use a
lot. This is a lot of about like
lot. This is a lot of about like
intuition and how to view the field.
intuition and how to view the field.
Okay, this is a lot and this links you
Okay, this is a lot and this links you
to resources. This like gives you a lot
to resources. This like gives you a lot
of good resources to read but it doesn't
of good resources to read but it doesn't
actually say read this then read this
actually say read this then read this
then read this then read this. doesn't
then read this then read this. doesn't
give you the introduction like that
give you the introduction like that
which is what I'm doing now. And then
which is what I'm doing now. And then
the other article that I think will
the other article that I think will
launch concurrently with this is we have
launch concurrently with this is we have
uh my programming advice which applies
uh my programming advice which applies
to people who've also been programming
to people who've also been programming
for several years. But just pretty much
for several years. But just pretty much
if the way that you see me writing code
if the way that you see me writing code
on stream looks weird, you should read
on stream looks weird, you should read
this. Um and then there's how to learn
this. Um and then there's how to learn
ML. This is actually really short
ML. This is actually really short
because Stamford CS231N is really really
because Stamford CS231N is really really
good and it's free online and if you
good and it's free online and if you
just take that one course which is very
just take that one course which is very
accessible you're kind of good to go.
accessible you're kind of good to go.
The only other thing that I added here
The only other thing that I added here
which is very important is because you
which is very important is because you
have to read papers in ML like you have
have to read papers in ML like you have
to read papers. You must um I added this
to read papers. You must um I added this
section here which is I think sheds a
section here which is I think sheds a
lot of light on why papers are the way
lot of light on why papers are the way
that they are and should make it a lot
that they are and should make it a lot
easier for people to get into reading
easier for people to get into reading
papers.
Thanks. Yeah.
Thanks. Yeah.
I mean cuz other than that, right,
some of the terms welcome to spinning
some of the terms welcome to spinning
up. So, spinning up is okay. Uh,
up. So, spinning up is okay. Uh,
spinning up is pretty good. The problem
spinning up is pretty good. The problem
with spinning up is it's like 10 times
with spinning up is it's like 10 times
too much math and like the code sucks.
too much math and like the code sucks.
So, it's really like the math is good,
So, it's really like the math is good,
but you don't need that much math to get
but you don't need that much math to get
started. If you have a strong math
started. If you have a strong math
background already and that helps you,
background already and that helps you,
then go for it. Uh, but if you have like
then go for it. Uh, but if you have like
either a more balanced background or a
either a more balanced background or a
more software heavy background, it's not
more software heavy background, it's not
going to help and the code sucks.
going to help and the code sucks.
So, that's tough.
Have you tried SACE?
Have you tried SACE?
Uh, I think people really only use SACE
Uh, I think people really only use SACE
in robotics these days because their
in robotics these days because their
simulators are slow.
simulators are slow.
I haven't actually seen like good
I haven't actually seen like good
evidence for SACE over anything else.
evidence for SACE over anything else.
The thing that people do uh which is
The thing that people do uh which is
really crappy is they always use steps
really crappy is they always use steps
for their Xaxis. So even if one is 10
for their Xaxis. So even if one is 10
times slower than the other, they still
times slower than the other, they still
use steps. Like they treat data as holy
use steps. Like they treat data as holy
and like you can never get any more data
and like you can never get any more data
even though you can.
even though you can.
So I don't think there's much to SACE.
So I don't think there's much to SACE.
I'd have to look more into it. It's also
I'd have to look more into it. It's also
there's problem with discrete spaces
there's problem with discrete spaces
which is annoying.
So I PO has been really good, but then
So I PO has been really good, but then
our version of PO is like our new
our version of PO is like our new
algorithm is a lot better than PO as
algorithm is a lot better than PO as
well. And the key is that it's fast. I
well. And the key is that it's fast. I
can guarantee you that nothing beats
can guarantee you that nothing beats
what we have here on speed. Like on raw
what we have here on speed. Like on raw
speed, ours is the fastest. If you want
speed, ours is the fastest. If you want
to get into sample efficiency, that's
to get into sample efficiency, that's
kind of the open area of research that I
kind of the open area of research that I
have to look into next. Uh the
have to look into next. Uh the
literature out there at the moment is
literature out there at the moment is
very very bad and the reason for that is
very very bad and the reason for that is
obvious, right? So if you're doing this
obvious, right? So if you're doing this
very sample efficient learning where
very sample efficient learning where
your experiments are really slow, you
your experiments are really slow, you
can't run a lot of experiments.
can't run a lot of experiments.
So you're kind of just screwed.
But my hope is that what we can do is we
But my hope is that what we can do is we
can take like the off policy algorithms,
can take like the off policy algorithms,
we can run them in the very high data
we can run them in the very high data
availability regime and see if the off
availability regime and see if the off
policy algorithms do better when you
policy algorithms do better when you
give them a ton of data than on policy
give them a ton of data than on policy
or if they're kind of the same. And then
or if they're kind of the same. And then
when you crank up the data reuse, we'll
when you crank up the data reuse, we'll
see if they diverge and if actually you
see if they diverge and if actually you
can use a lot more compute to get a lot
can use a lot more compute to get a lot
better results or not. Like good
better results or not. Like good
controlled experiments kind of just
controlled experiments kind of just
don't exist for this stuff.
Let's say that the last three of these
Let's say that the last three of these
are going to be reserved for

What other two things do I give people
What other two things do I give people
before then?
Oh, you know what it is? You know what I

stick Impala on here.
And Paula is actually kind of
There any multi- aent? Well, yeah,
There any multi- aent? Well, yeah,
there's going to be
these.
I think we'll order them.
Are there other papers I should

recommend people?
recommend people?
Trying to think of the papers.
Excellent.
I have a big project I'm working on and
I have a big project I'm working on and
could use your knowledge or help. Sure.
could use your knowledge or help. Sure.
What is it?
Maybe should I link Buddy.
No, cuz that's not one of mine.
Holy growth today. My gosh.
I think what we do is we link all of
I think what we do is we link all of
these
these
and unlike the original, we actually
and unlike the original, we actually
give reasons why you read these
I don't want to link anybody any of my
I don't want to link anybody any of my
own papers to be honest. I kind of hate
own papers to be honest. I kind of hate
all my papers.
Are there any that I think are kind of
Are there any that I think are kind of
good?
Not really at all. Right. Is there a
Not really at all. Right. Is there a
neural MMO 3 paper?
neural MMO 3 paper?
No, there isn't. Right. I didn't write
No, there isn't. Right. I didn't write
one.
Maybe net hack.
I think this one's a good one to read.
I'm trying to think if there are other
I'm trying to think if there are other
papers that I really think like that
papers that I really think like that
should really be included.
You probably should be linked DQN.
Yeah, you should probably be linked DQN.
Oh, go obviously.
Where was the original one? Is it only
Where was the original one? Is it only
on
is this article uh not
it not on archive?
Hey, Muhammad. Welcome. Your chat does
Hey, Muhammad. Welcome. Your chat does
work.
This still useful.
It's a pretty easy read
as well, isn't it?
I think this is probably the one to

Let me see. I'm looking. What? You're
Let me see. I'm looking. What? You're
Yeah, I'm looking at it.
What?
Hey man, this doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, if I have a dolearn function that
Yeah, if I have a dolearn function that
works on literally anything, then you've
works on literally anything, then you've
assumed a conclusion,

right?
There's not a single system in existence
There's not a single system in existence
that works that way either. Like
that works that way either. Like
you can't just tell an LLM to do that,
you can't just tell an LLM to do that,
for instance, and have it work. It'll
for instance, and have it work. It'll
just kind of spin its wheels and do
just kind of spin its wheels and do
nothing.
can't send links in chat. That's
can't send links in chat. That's
YouTube, Muhammad, not me. Just tell me
YouTube, Muhammad, not me. Just tell me
what to Google or whatever if you want
what to Google or whatever if you want
to link me something. YouTube just bans
to link me something. YouTube just bans
links and I don't think there's an
links and I don't think there's an
option to disable that. They do it to
option to disable that. They do it to
prevent bots.
Yeah, you can either tell me what to
Yeah, you can either tell me what to
Google or DM it to me on X or Discord.

yeah, no, this is going to make

everybody like not want to do RL unless
everybody like not want to do RL unless
you really really like math. Like this
you really really like math. Like this
is just not
you do not need this level of math.
you do not need this level of math.
Like come on. This is not even like why
Like come on. This is not even like why
the do they have integrals?
the do they have integrals?
Why have they replaced all the sums with

integrals for discrete problems? It's
integrals for discrete problems? It's
like they tried to generalize it to
like they tried to generalize it to
continuous time or whatever, but it's
continuous time or whatever, but it's
not like it's fundamentally not.
Also, their policy gradient derivation
Also, their policy gradient derivation
is like three times longer than the

Yeah. If you told me you have to do this
Yeah. If you told me you have to do this
amount of math to get to reinforce,

You want to know something that's kind

of funny? It's actually way easier for

like if you have a strong math math
like if you have a strong math math
background, you can go read all the

Took me a week to get past the first two
Took me a week to get past the first two
pages. Yeah. So, like that's not
pages. Yeah. So, like that's not
productive at all. Like that's basically
productive at all. Like that's basically
academic hazing
academic hazing
because the material is not actually

Thank you.
Thank you.
I haven't proof read it yet.
I'll put learning dexterity first
I'll put learning dexterity first
because it kind of pioneered the method.

I have two free months and I'm looking
I have two free months and I'm looking
to contribute to Puffer AI. Where do you
to contribute to Puffer AI. Where do you
suggest that I start? I have a good RL
suggest that I start? I have a good RL
and programming background. Depends on
and programming background. Depends on
your interests. So, there is heavy
your interests. So, there is heavy
research side stuff to do. there's heavy

infrastructure side stuff to do. Uh and
infrastructure side stuff to do. Uh and
we're also looking for like applications
we're also looking for like applications
that are going to be useful in a number
that are going to be useful in a number
of different areas. Okay. So on the
of different areas. Okay. So on the
research side uh and this is a thing

that I'm going to start doing quite
that I'm going to start doing quite
soon.
soon.
We're going to have a big comprehensive
We're going to have a big comprehensive
push to look through all of the 2020 era

if there is anything to offline methods.
if there is anything to offline methods.
They're kind of a mess and all the
They're kind of a mess and all the
research in the space is like kind of a
research in the space is like kind of a
mess. So, we're probably going to have
mess. So, we're probably going to have
to do some sort of version of Puffarel,
to do some sort of version of Puffarel,
which is our main trainer that does that
which is our main trainer that does that
stuff and like try out all the different
stuff and like try out all the different
components and methods and see what
components and methods and see what
matters and what doesn't. That's one
matters and what doesn't. That's one
huge thing on research side. Um, yeah,
huge thing on research side. Um, yeah,
there's stuff on hyperparameter tuning
there's stuff on hyperparameter tuning
and and other things in research as
and and other things in research as
well. I think that's the main big one
well. I think that's the main big one
though. Let's see. Uh on the
though. Let's see. Uh on the
infrastructure side, we want to actually
infrastructure side, we want to actually
get close uh MFU to what is
get close uh MFU to what is
theoretically possible, right? We want
theoretically possible, right? We want
to get uh close to one on that or 100,
to get uh close to one on that or 100,
however you define it. We haven't
however you define it. We haven't
actually done that stuff formally. As
actually done that stuff formally. As
fast as Puffer is, I think it could be
fast as Puffer is, I think it could be
like two or three times faster yet.
like two or three times faster yet.
Again, if we were to optimize that
Again, if we were to optimize that
stuff, there is also other related
stuff, there is also other related
infrastructure things we can do with
infrastructure things we can do with
optimizing uh data transfer from CPU to
optimizing uh data transfer from CPU to
GPU. And then on the applications and
GPU. And then on the applications and
environment side, there are a couple
environment side, there are a couple
things there. Uh on one hand, like
things there. Uh on one hand, like
there's the idea of designing probe
there's the idea of designing probe
environments to help us with our
environments to help us with our
algorithmic research, but then there's
algorithmic research, but then there's
also the idea of like just going out and
also the idea of like just going out and
finding hard problems in industry that
finding hard problems in industry that
could be solved with fast sim and trying
could be solved with fast sim and trying
to do that. That is also the way that
to do that. That is also the way that
you get involved with the business side
you get involved with the business side
of Puffer.
We do all of like all the research is
We do all of like all the research is
managed via the Discord. So,
managed via the Discord. So,
discord.gg/puffer
discord.gg/puffer
if you're not already in there. And then
if you're not already in there. And then
uh I also I mean I stream of course as
uh I also I mean I stream of course as
much as I can.
Both research and application look
Both research and application look
interesting. I'll be more active on
interesting. I'll be more active on
Discord from now on. Yeah, I mean that's
Discord from now on. Yeah, I mean that's
the main thing. just like at me on there
the main thing. just like at me on there
and I usually catch everything unless
and I usually catch everything unless
people are spamming my chats.
and capture the flag was still 3v3.
It's a 2v2.
3v3.
Professor,
I am not a professor. I am technically a
I am not a professor. I am technically a

that current phones and laptops will be

so much better if they had local LMS
so much better if they had local LMS
lava quantized versions developers could
lava quantized versions developers could
just add useful features on top? Not
just add useful features on top? Not
really.
really.
Like, yeah, not really.
You'd have to come up with something
You'd have to come up with something
that that actually lets you do that's
that that actually lets you do that's
interesting
interesting
cuz right now like the have a chatbot
cuz right now like the have a chatbot
assist like assistant everywhere thing
assist like assistant everywhere thing
has really not been all that useful.
I I mean I don't even know if it does
I I mean I don't even know if it does
anything if you have a good one, right?
anything if you have a good one, right?
Like if I give you 03 on a phone, does
Like if I give you 03 on a phone, does
that actually do anything
advisor and coach? it was the right
advisor and coach? it was the right
thing to tell me in the moment. Yeah,
thing to tell me in the moment. Yeah,
the thing is that um the LLMs, they kind
the thing is that um the LLMs, they kind
of just lie half the time.
of just lie half the time.
So
yeah,
yeah,
they're very good at giving you coherent
they're very good at giving you coherent
sounding information that makes no
sounding information that makes no
sense.
Like half the time you'll ask something
Like half the time you'll ask something
that you can just Google and it'll just
that you can just Google and it'll just
give you the wrong answer.
give you the wrong answer.
Advisers and especially coaches aren't
Advisers and especially coaches aren't
pure oracles of truth either. Yeah. No,
pure oracles of truth either. Yeah. No,
but this one's particularly bad.
I mean, I could see in a couple of
I mean, I could see in a couple of
generations them being very useful, but
generations them being very useful, but
at the moment they kind of just aren't
Yeah, they just gaslight you. Exactly.
Yeah, they just gaslight you. Exactly.
They're kind of bad.
Like honestly, everybody shits on
Like honestly, everybody shits on
Perplexity, but I like the thing that
Perplexity, but I like the thing that
they actually tried to do.
they actually tried to do.
I don't use this, and maybe I should,
I don't use this, and maybe I should,
but like uh is the effect of
but like uh is the effect of
counting rate in RL.
So, this thing actually gives you
So, this thing actually gives you
citations for stuff
citations for stuff
which like they're not very good, right?
which like they're not very good, right?
These are really bad citations, but the
These are really bad citations, but the
idea of having like this is where this

actually I would like it to have it so
actually I would like it to have it so
that you can literally it would quote
that you can literally it would quote
the material from the specific source.

Like something like this is I think
Like something like this is I think
closer to what I would want
closer to what I would want
because otherwise like the generations
because otherwise like the generations
are just crap. Like if this thing can go
are just crap. Like if this thing can go
find me this information out of like
find me this information out of like
textbooks and papers and stuff and say,
textbooks and papers and stuff and say,
you know, here are these five different
you know, here are these five different
like five different sources. They
like five different sources. They
present this information this way. I'd
present this information this way. I'd
be way happier rather than it just being

Pull in search results. Yeah. So, they
Pull in search results. Yeah. So, they
pull in search results. They all do this
pull in search results. They all do this
at this point, but then they get it
at this point, but then they get it
wrong.
Instead of retrieval augmented

What's Carpathy's plan with Eureka Labs?
What's Carpathy's plan with Eureka Labs?
ML only by LLMs.
No idea.
No idea.
Sound like you're against LMs or feel
Sound like you're against LMs or feel
they're overrated?
No. I mean, I think LLMs are very good.
No. I mean, I think LLMs are very good.
And I think that there's like a one in
And I think that there's like a one in
three chance that LM solve everything.
They're just incredibly incredibly
They're just incredibly incredibly
overhyped right now, though. And it's
overhyped right now, though. And it's
like 99% of the attention and resources
like 99% of the attention and resources
are on uh language models when it seems
are on uh language models when it seems
like there's some pretty clear
like there's some pretty clear
fundamental problems that we're kind of
fundamental problems that we're kind of
just all ignoring because that doesn't
just all ignoring because that doesn't
help us raise money.
I do use LLMs in like a fair bit of my
I do use LLMs in like a fair bit of my
work. I just don't like copy paste
work. I just don't like copy paste
blocks of generated code and I'm very
blocks of generated code and I'm very
very careful when I use them as sources
very careful when I use them as sources
for stuff because again half the stuff
for stuff because again half the stuff
is just wrong.
Why one and three?
Why one and three?
My personal best probability estimate. I
My personal best probability estimate. I
don't know.
But do you think that's too high or too
But do you think that's too high or too
low?
I mean it's the fact that like
I mean it's the fact that like
humans are really really bad at
humans are really really bad at
estimating exponential scaling. So like
estimating exponential scaling. So like
it is possible that a lot of the things
it is possible that a lot of the things
that look like fundamental problems just
that look like fundamental problems just
disappear as you continue to pour
disappear as you continue to pour
billions of dollars into these things
billions of dollars into these things
and like the hardware also just gets
and like the hardware also just gets
better. So maybe we just end up with
better. So maybe we just end up with
like a 10 trillion parameter model
like a 10 trillion parameter model
that's just actually amazing.
that's just actually amazing.
Um
it we just we haven't really seen these
it we just we haven't really seen these
things work in any of the ways that like
things work in any of the ways that like
intelligence needs to work though. Like
intelligence needs to work though. Like
why the hell can't an LLM go teach
why the hell can't an LLM go teach
itself stuff, right?
itself stuff, right?
Like any reasonably smart person can go
Like any reasonably smart person can go
out and teach themselves something,
go learn quantum physics. All right, I
go learn quantum physics. All right, I
will come back several weeks later with
will come back several weeks later with
a decent knowledge of quantum physics.
a decent knowledge of quantum physics.
But like it seems like the LLMs, it's
But like it seems like the LLMs, it's
kind of just what you do in pre-training
kind of just what you do in pre-training
and then you're stuck with that. And
and then you're stuck with that. And
there's not

It's that just kernels are a pretty

but it's like a lot of very heavy theory
but it's like a lot of very heavy theory
that doesn't really show you
that doesn't really show you
like how to actually make RL work.
So I would suggest to you like just
So I would suggest to you like just
honestly go check out the stuff we're
honestly go check out the stuff we're
doing in Puffer Lib now. There are a

whole bunch of articles and there is a a

how to write your own environment. Like
how to write your own environment. Like
most of the people that are getting into
most of the people that are getting into
RL, I just tell them to start writing
RL, I just tell them to start writing
environments because there's no better
environments because there's no better
way to learn RL than to actually build a

problem yourself and then make RL solve

it from scratch and figure out like

you'll see all the things that can go

you'll also be starting out from a point

where our algorithms are actually pretty

good rather than most of the things in

actually work or they only work if you
actually work or they only work if you
spend three months tuning them.
The guide I'm working on right here is

we can do here.
It's a good thing to have done.
I actually think we're going to just do
I actually think we're going to just do
advanced topics.
Let's say for example I wanted to use

at least a first draft of the guide
at least a first draft of the guide
today. That is the goal.
I tried. I got the full set. 10k maps.

100k is technically

you have 100k though, don't you? Did you

It's got my advice on learning

Honestly though,

the ML section is very easy. Like the
the ML section is very easy. Like the
most like go take CS231N. It is
most like go take CS231N. It is
available for free online with very good
available for free online with very good
lectures. And then the rest of my advice

basically just has to do with like how
basically just has to do with like how
to think about reading scientific papers

because once you take 231N

Oh, GPT or he heavily prompted Llama 3.
Why can't you just heavily prompt GPT?
I don't think Llama 3 is any good, is

it?
I mean, either of these like the thing
I mean, either of these like the thing
is neither of these are going to work at

there are a bunch of startups at the

run language models in a loop in order

to build applications and they've like

hacked a whole bunch of stuff to try to

of just can't do this stuff with base
of just can't do this stuff with base

Hi.
Hi.
So, um,
So, um,
plan for today.
I'm going to write a little bit on that
I'm going to write a little bit on that
article,
article,
check a couple of experiments, do a
check a couple of experiments, do a
couple small things. Uh, I am getting
couple small things. Uh, I am getting
ready to
ready to
head out of here, spend a few days in
head out of here, spend a few days in
Florida, and then go to Palo Alto.
Florida, and then go to Palo Alto.
So, uh, pretty much the main thing over
So, uh, pretty much the main thing over
the next few weeks, got a couple
the next few weeks, got a couple
articles to put out. I've got a few
articles to put out. I've got a few
things to make sure we're working on our
things to make sure we're working on our
servers. have a few different research
servers. have a few different research
projects that we're
projects that we're
in a good spot with.
in a good spot with.
And uh we will uh so yeah, we'll we'll
And uh we will uh so yeah, we'll we'll
have like probably a pretty chill
have like probably a pretty chill
bit of time, but I still want to keep
bit of time, but I still want to keep
streaming and I still want to like go
streaming and I still want to like go
off some of the things I'm working on
off some of the things I'm working on
here. Let me grab this.
We had a little bit of an interesting
We had a little bit of an interesting
morning here,
I guess. uh that got seen finally saw
I guess. uh that got seen finally saw
some of the RL stuff. I know he's been
some of the RL stuff. I know he's been
like doing RL things here and there and
like doing RL things here and there and
uh he saw some of the recent stuff. So,
uh he saw some of the recent stuff. So,
uh yeah, thanks for the uh the
uh yeah, thanks for the uh the
endorsement, man.
endorsement, man.
It's a very nice bit of growth.
It's a very nice bit of growth.
Welcome, Mag.
All right, so here's what we are uh
All right, so here's what we are uh
we're going to do. I am pull up a reream
we're going to do. I am pull up a reream
first of all.
first of all.
And I think we're going to check the
And I think we're going to check the
experiments
experiments
just to see if I I did anything. I kind
just to see if I I did anything. I kind
of forget if I had stuff running. I
of forget if I had stuff running. I
think I had like a neural MMO run going.
think I had like a neural MMO run going.
And then after that
after that we'll get writing a bit.
This is still live.
Okay. So, I guess we'll see if this is
Okay. So, I guess we'll see if this is
more stable.
more stable.
Uh, basically, I reduced the learning
Uh, basically, I reduced the learning
rate. And it doesn't look like that
rate. And it doesn't look like that
changed literally anything.
changed literally anything.
Like, they're basically the same exact
Like, they're basically the same exact
thing. And we'll see if this crashes or
thing. And we'll see if this crashes or
not.
not.
I guess there is. If we look at this
I guess there is. If we look at this
right here,
right here,
there's like a very very slight
there's like a very very slight
difference in perf, but it's almost
difference in perf, but it's almost
negligible.
negligible.
Yeah, that's got to be like negligible,
Yeah, that's got to be like negligible,
right? I guess it kind of slows. No, you
right? I guess it kind of slows. No, you
know, there is a difference. So, with
know, there is a difference. So, with
the lower learning rate, look at this.
the lower learning rate, look at this.
You see that?
You see that?
It actually doesn't do anything
It actually doesn't do anything
for 10 billion steps.
for 10 billion steps.
Isn't that funny?
So, it just does flat and then this.
So, it just does flat and then this.
That's kind of cursed.
Well, we'll see if it's stable or not.
Well, we'll see if it's stable or not.
And we'll see if this like jumps up or
And we'll see if this like jumps up or
not. Whatever.
But yeah, it's only 640 bill that it's
But yeah, it's only 640 bill that it's
supposed to run for, right?
supposed to run for, right?
That's a soda mo model either way.
That's a soda mo model either way.
Okay, I'm good with that for now.
I got all sorts of people messaging me
I got all sorts of people messaging me
now from uh
now from uh
those tweets.
Do I even have Hang on.
Let me let me set a couple quick things
Let me let me set a couple quick things
up so that I can actually reply to stuff
up so that I can actually reply to stuff
effectively throughout the day. And then
effectively throughout the day. And then
I think what we're going to do is we're
I think what we're going to do is we're
going to write on the quick start guide
going to write on the quick start guide
a little bit today. So, if you guys are
a little bit today. So, if you guys are
interested in helping uh shape
interested in helping uh shape
the learning material that I'm putting
the learning material that I'm putting
out because I don't do a ton of this
out because I don't do a ton of this
content. I really don't do a ton of
content. I really don't do a ton of
educational content. So, if you want to
educational content. So, if you want to
help shape this little bit and make it
help shape this little bit and make it
as useful as possible to you, you'll be
as useful as possible to you, you'll be
able to do that today.
Welcome major. Yeah.
I just have to enter one one thing here
I just have to enter one one thing here
guys and I'll get started.
Captures.
All
right.
Cool. So, uh, let me see if there's any
Cool. So, uh, let me see if there's any
of It's like because there's like this
of It's like because there's like this
massive blow up now that I'm just
massive blow up now that I'm just
getting because of all of the, uh, the
getting because of all of the, uh, the
new stuff, which is Good.
I got yet seen looking through hyper
I got yet seen looking through hyper
pram stuff as well.
All
right. I I did not intend to just like
right. I I did not intend to just like
start stream and be handling DMs, but
start stream and be handling DMs, but
let me at least like
let me at least like
it would be cool to have him uh doing
it would be cool to have him uh doing
some drone stuff around with us. It
some drone stuff around with us. It
would be fun.
All
right.
right.
People are noticing has been looking for
People are noticing has been looking for
cool projects for a while. Yeah, man. I
cool projects for a while. Yeah, man. I
hope so.
hope so.
It It definitely helps. It's like It's
It It definitely helps. It's like It's
very cool because we get more open
very cool because we get more open
source stuff. we help the clients and
source stuff. we help the clients and
also it does actually generate us like
also it does actually generate us like
additional inbounds on clients as well
additional inbounds on clients as well
which which helps because I would like
which which helps because I would like
to make this thing uh like a larger
to make this thing uh like a larger
private lab so we can get more servers
private lab so we can get more servers
and fund more stuff.
Okay. So, where we left this off,
where we left this thing off, I think I
where we left this thing off, I think I
was five sections through.
Yeah, five sections through.
I'm trying to think how I want to
I'm trying to think how I want to
position this.
position this.
So,
So,
for new people here, does this sort of
for new people here, does this sort of
plan
plan
make sense or is there uh stuff you'd
make sense or is there uh stuff you'd
want to see in here that's different?
want to see in here that's different?
So, quick summary.
So, quick summary.
advice so far. And this is linked to all
advice so far. And this is linked to all
sorts of articles in here.
sorts of articles in here.
Super basic intro that has you build the
Super basic intro that has you build the
simplest possible working thing.
simplest possible working thing.
Some pretty accessible fundamentals.
A still pretty dang simple but at least
A still pretty dang simple but at least
kind of cool environment that you build.

start feeding in a little bit of the
start feeding in a little bit of the
fundamental knowledge, some stuff about
fundamental knowledge, some stuff about
how our infrastructure works, some stuff
how our infrastructure works, some stuff
about general RL, and then by here
about general RL, and then by here
you're doing like a real Contact.
Sounds good so far.
Little the cobwebs out of my head a
Little the cobwebs out of my head a
little bit here.
I have like multiple DM threads that I
I have like multiple DM threads that I
was expecting to like calm down.
was expecting to like calm down.
Whatever. So, puffer algo article.
Whatever. So, puffer algo article.
Let's go grab these. Let me see. What
Let's go grab these. Let me see. What
did I actually write? because I have
did I actually write? because I have
like a few different things.
feel like.
I think this is the main. Are there any
I think this is the main. Are there any
of these that I want to link otherwise?
Yeah, that take is kind of dated.
Where's the 3 article?
Oh, there isn't a three. It's just Yeah.
Oh, there isn't a three. It's just Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
It was the trailer. Cool. That's fine.
These two are the same. That's why I've
These two are the same. That's why I've
been confused and stuck here cuz it
been confused and stuck here cuz it
doesn't make any sense.
Right.
Yeah, this is like
I I honestly think that these last ones
I I honestly think that these last ones
I kind of just wrote these at the end of
I kind of just wrote these at the end of
the stream and uh they don't like the
the stream and uh they don't like the
ordering and the sequencing isn't good.
ordering and the sequencing isn't good.
I think this is fine.
We have you build something. That's
We have you build something. That's
cool. We give you a very accessible blog
cool. We give you a very accessible blog
post. It's a pretty short read.
Make you read a little bit of code and
Make you read a little bit of code and
build some more stuff.
Yeah, my sequencing is totally off.
I think that we don't give them this
I think that we don't give them this
infrastructure here.
infrastructure here.
I think I move this down
I think I move this down
and I give these articles
and I give these articles
here.
Okay.
Okay.
You know, I
You know, I
I don't like that I'm giving people the
I don't like that I'm giving people the
PO paper this early. Almost, right? I'm
PO paper this early. Almost, right? I'm
kind of stuck,
kind of stuck,
actually. Let me ask you guys about
actually. Let me ask you guys about
this. Okay. Let me let me ask you guys
this. Okay. Let me let me ask you guys
about this. What What do you do about
about this. What What do you do about
this? Okay, so I've linked a couple blog
this? Okay, so I've linked a couple blog
posts at this point, even just one that
posts at this point, even just one that
aren't mine. Like I linked Carpathy's
aren't mine. Like I linked Carpathy's
post, right? But pretty much the rest of
post, right? But pretty much the rest of
all this material comes from me.
all this material comes from me.
So
So
like I don't want to make the guide just
like I don't want to make the guide just
like, hey, read all of my other stuff
like, hey, read all of my other stuff
and you're good, right?
and you're good, right?
Like I want to link you to external
Like I want to link you to external
formal resources. But the problem is my
formal resources. But the problem is my
stuff is literally way easier to
stuff is literally way easier to
understand than everything else that's
understand than everything else that's
out there. Okay? Like let me show you
out there. Okay? Like let me show you
the difference.
the difference.
This is my where's my description of PO.
This is my where's my description of PO.
Okay? I just say yeah this is just
Okay? I just say yeah this is just
vanilla policy gradient with general
vanilla policy gradient with general
generalized advantage estimation which
generalized advantage estimation which
is just a fancy exponential reward
is just a fancy exponential reward
discounting with a value function

baseline and it adds policy clipping.
baseline and it adds policy clipping.
Like I give you like a three sentence
Like I give you like a three sentence
description that's like this is what PO
description that's like this is what PO
is and how it works for the most part.
is and how it works for the most part.
All right? And that's like 80%
All right? And that's like 80%
of the actual intuition behind the
of the actual intuition behind the
algorithm is these three or four
algorithm is these three or four
sentences. And if you actually look, I
sentences. And if you actually look, I
have more detailed content on my
have more detailed content on my
algorithms and stuff. But then the
algorithms and stuff. But then the
problem is as soon as I link you
to like an actual formal paper, okay,
to like an actual formal paper, okay,
this is the difference.
this is the difference.
They're going to hit you with all this
They're going to hit you with all this
crap.
crap.
All right? And the thing is when I read
All right? And the thing is when I read
this, like I know that none of this
this, like I know that none of this
even matters. Like this doesn't even
even matters. Like this doesn't even
matter. You can ignore this. This is
matter. You can ignore this. This is
just a poorly written version of a
just a poorly written version of a
different formula. And then this is like
different formula. And then this is like
this is like using fancy math to explain
this is like using fancy math to explain
something that is basically two
something that is basically two
sentences in plain English with exactly
sentences in plain English with exactly
the same meaning. Like
I don't want to like confuse the hell
I don't want to like confuse the hell
out of new people to RL because some
out of new people to RL because some
people are going to come in with a math
people are going to come in with a math
background where yeah this is easy and
background where yeah this is easy and
some people are going to be like what
some people are going to be like what
the hell is this?
the hell is this?
And the thing is you do not need to
And the thing is you do not need to
understand this to understand the RL. So
understand this to understand the RL. So
I don't actually know what to do with it
I don't actually know what to do with it
can be referred to the materials.
can be referred to the materials.
Yeah, exactly. So but Spencer, this is
Yeah, exactly. So but Spencer, this is
this is kind of my goal here is to And
this is kind of my goal here is to And
also, hey, how's it going? I hope you're
also, hey, how's it going? I hope you're
doing all right with the Texas floods. I
doing all right with the Texas floods. I
don't know if those are anywhere near
don't know if those are anywhere near
you. Um,
I pretty much like I'm trying to drip
I pretty much like I'm trying to drip
feed in content,
feed in content,
but like I don't want people to say
but like I don't want people to say
like, "Ah, don't worry about it. You
like, "Ah, don't worry about it. You
don't need to learn it." You do need to
don't need to learn it." You do need to
learn the stuff at some point, but like
learn the stuff at some point, but like
I kind of want to make sure that people
I kind of want to make sure that people
have already seen, okay, I can build
have already seen, okay, I can build
some I already can build awesome stuff.
some I already can build awesome stuff.
Now, let me maybe go to learn some of
Now, let me maybe go to learn some of
the formalism.
the formalism.
Um,
it's tricky to balance those two things.
Also, I got us a bunch of cool inbound,
Also, I got us a bunch of cool inbound,
so working on that.
We're at
We're at
82 as well.
in moving.
in moving.
I'm building much more educational and
I'm building much more educational and
so do I.
It's a little tough though because like
A lot of the questions that you ask,
A lot of the questions that you ask,
right, the thing is like, okay, how do I
right, the thing is like, okay, how do I
magically know the answer to everything,
magically know the answer to everything,
right?
It's because I actually h like I
It's because I actually h like I
understand the actual fundamentals,
understand the actual fundamentals,
right?
Stuff should be referenced.
Stuff should be referenced.
I have that in the quick start guide.
I have that in the quick start guide.
I'm kind of trying to give people an
I'm kind of trying to give people an
order like instead of like reference
order like instead of like reference
this, reference that, I'm trying to give
this, reference that, I'm trying to give
people a very like a pretty script, a
people a very like a pretty script, a
pretty strict prescribed do this, do
pretty strict prescribed do this, do
this, do this, read this, do this, read
this, do this, read this, do this, read
that. Now you know RL, congratulations.
Okay, let me see if I can put it further
Okay, let me see if I can put it further
down at least.
The problem is I like I don't like that
The problem is I like I don't like that
we have no references
we have no references
like outside of carpath is blog.
Let me see how self-contained this is.
the CS classes aren't going to help with
the CS classes aren't going to help with
the papers.
The thing is the main the main
The thing is the main the main
algorithmic paper it looks like this
also this
and this
like relative to how simple the idea is.
like relative to how simple the idea is.
It's a super dense paper. Like actually,
It's a super dense paper. Like actually,
as far as RL papers go, this isn't even
as far as RL papers go, this isn't even
that bad. But like relative to how
that bad. But like relative to how
utterly simple
utterly simple
the poor algorithm is.
the poor algorithm is.
Like this is a lot.
Like I don't want to link people that.
Like I don't want to link people that.
But the thing is I can't
But the thing is I can't
I can't link you the article.
like our followup to PO without PO.
I don't think anybody has a good blog
I don't think anybody has a good blog
post on PO either.
Do I need to make one? I really don't
Do I need to make one? I really don't
want to.
Let me see if I can link people a
Let me see if I can link people a
section of it or I can at least tell
section of it or I can at least tell
people how to read it in a way that's
people how to read it in a way that's
not going to be this painful cuz I think
not going to be this painful cuz I think
you do need to at least see where like
you do need to at least see where like
that there like this exists but I think
that there like this exists but I think
you need to not suffer.
This is a difficult thing to do.
It's tough here. It is really tough.
There's the thing is fundamentally
There's the thing is fundamentally
there's no way you can genuinely
there's no way you can genuinely
understand RL without being able to
understand RL without being able to
interact with the literature.
What?
What?
Yeah, there's an im there's a difference
Yeah, there's an im there's a difference
between an avocado and a hand gun as
between an avocado and a hand gun as
well. What's your point?
Okay. What is the optimal point to start
Okay. What is the optimal point to start
interacting with the literature?
built a couple small projects.
built a couple small projects.
The thing is custom networks is not even
The thing is custom networks is not even
in this.
in this.
So custom networks is covered by the
So custom networks is covered by the
background material like CS231N. You
background material like CS231N. You
should know how to build custom
should know how to build custom
networks.
It's definitely at least after you've
It's definitely at least after you've
built like one substantial project.
I think I just need to prefix it with
I think I just need to prefix it with
some stuff.
I think I need to give him the PO paper
I think I need to give him the PO paper
relatively early, but with the caveat
relatively early, but with the caveat
that like
that like
the paper's a lot simpler than what is
the paper's a lot simpler than what is
actually presented.
Set a timer cuz I got a meeting.
Try to get it done before then.
Hey, boxing. What are we trying to do
Hey, boxing. What are we trying to do
here? So, I'm trying to figure out how I
here? So, I'm trying to figure out how I
can make this article
can make this article
actually good for people learning RL.
The point is to understand PPO. I don't
The point is to understand PPO. I don't
think you can avoid back and forth.
think you can avoid back and forth.
Yeah, exactly.
The thing is it's like you can't really
The thing is it's like you can't really
implement PO
implement PO
like implementing PO is not a short
like implementing PO is not a short
exercise because like the very small
exercise because like the very small
details for which there isn't really any
details for which there isn't really any
theoretical basis matter a lot in terms
theoretical basis matter a lot in terms
of whether it's actually going to work
of whether it's actually going to work
or not.
I don't feel there's a place where they
I don't feel there's a place where they
distilled the high into it. Yeah,
distilled the high into it. Yeah,
exactly.
It's clipped. It's clipped. It's clipped
It's clipped. It's clipped. It's clipped
updates on policy gradients so that you
updates on policy gradients so that you
don't go too far off policy.
don't go too far off policy.
The generalized advantage estimation is
The generalized advantage estimation is
a better as a better form of reward
a better as a better form of reward
discounting than bullet
This help.
Okay, I think this is okay.
We give you a build section.
We give you a build section.
This is like a few hours worth of
This is like a few hours worth of
reading.
And then I think you kind of have the
And then I think you kind of have the
background to do something.
background to do something.
quite a bit more substantial and you
quite a bit more substantial and you
should hopefully have enough intuition
should hopefully have enough intuition
not totally mess stuff up
the rest of my quick start guide
very relieving actually I opened PO saw
very relieving actually I opened PO saw
the equation was like oh okay much more
the equation was like oh okay much more
adequate yeah so this is the problem max
adequate yeah so this is the problem max
and I'm trying to make this guide
and I'm trying to make this guide
actually pretty well just ex like just
actually pretty well just ex like just
for you in this sense. Um
for you in this sense. Um
like it's exactly for you in that case
like it's exactly for you in that case
cuz like this type of stuff sucks and
cuz like this type of stuff sucks and
like I know what this is because I've
like I know what this is because I've
seen this specific notation and this
seen this specific notation and this
specific equation a bunch of times but

if I open a random RL paper that has
if I open a random RL paper that has
like even the exact same thing or
like even the exact same thing or
something very similar in a different
something very similar in a different
notation, it will take me a couple hours
notation, it will take me a couple hours
to figure out what they're saying. Uh
to figure out what they're saying. Uh
sometimes it's because the math is
sometimes it's because the math is
actually very precise and very helpful
actually very precise and very helpful
and it's just complicated. But most of
and it's just complicated. But most of
the time it's just because researchers
the time it's just because researchers
like writing math for the sake of
like writing math for the sake of
writing math.
The actual math that you need to know.
The actual math that you need to know.
Okay. So it helps to be able to
Okay. So it helps to be able to
understand notation enough such that if
understand notation enough such that if
you spend a couple hours you can figure
you spend a couple hours you can figure
out what they're actually trying to do
out what they're actually trying to do
with all the math, right? Like that is
with all the math, right? Like that is
helpful.
helpful.
Um, but outside of that,
Um, but outside of that,
the knowledge you need for RL is the
the knowledge you need for RL is the
same as the knowledge you need just to
same as the knowledge you need just to
understand the fundamentals of deep
understand the fundamentals of deep

build some crazy cool RL stuff before
build some crazy cool RL stuff before
you even understand it. Um the thing is
you even understand it. Um the thing is
it the point of really getting into the
it the point of really getting into the
RL literature is if you want to actually
RL literature is if you want to actually
help us advance the core algorithmic
help us advance the core algorithmic
research that's the like that is the
research that's the like that is the
point at which you really need to

understand this stuff it helps generally

and like I don't know if you watch me
and like I don't know if you watch me
debugging people's stuff in
debugging people's stuff in
reinforcement learning like we'll always
reinforcement learning like we'll always
have contributors that'll show me a
have contributors that'll show me a
thing and I'll just go like oh yeah do
thing and I'll just go like oh yeah do
this and and it'll instantly work. That
this and and it'll instantly work. That
comes from a very strong grasp of
comes from a very strong grasp of
fundamentals plus years of practical
fundamentals plus years of practical
experience. But like you do need it
experience. But like you do need it
eventually, but like I don't write stuff
eventually, but like I don't write stuff
this way, right? I do not write this
this way, right? I do not write this
type of stuff. I will write the exact
type of stuff. I will write the exact
same content, the exact same
same content, the exact same
information, but not like this if I can

avoid it.
avoid it.
The one exception I did do this for the
The one exception I did do this for the
protein blog post but that was because I
protein blog post but that was because I
was directly referencing another very
was directly referencing another very
heavy mathematical work. So like I did
heavy mathematical work. So like I did
this
this
I did this thing right
I did this thing right
this is the background on the algorithm
this is the background on the algorithm
and then I said okay this is our new
and then I said okay this is our new
function here
function here
but that's about as much as I did and
but that's about as much as I did and
the pro the uh the carbs paper that
the pro the uh the carbs paper that
protein is based on is arguably much
protein is based on is arguably much
heavier mathematically than um the PO
heavier mathematically than um the PO
paper but the idea is not that
paper but the idea is not that
complicated Hell.
Okay.
Okay.
So, that's the first five.
So, that's the first five.
started with five sections done and we
started with five sections done and we
have five slightly better sections done.
have five slightly better sections done.
I guess we have this paragraph as well
I guess we have this paragraph as well
that we're left over with.
But once people have done a project,
research applications, infrastructure,
research applications, infrastructure,
right? Are going to be three of them.
I can make the last three sections a
I can make the last three sections a
choose your own adventure.
Me grab more coffee real quick. So, I
Me grab more coffee real quick. So, I
know the last three sections are going
know the last three sections are going
to be advanced infrastructure,
to be advanced infrastructure,
um, going to be advanced
um, going to be advanced
research, like how to actually get into
research, like how to actually get into
research,
research,
and then applications.
and then applications.
Oh, we have a fair few folks on YouTube

relatively new to RL and you have ideas
relatively new to RL and you have ideas
on things that you would like to see
on things that you would like to see
presented in this guide, that's why I'm
presented in this guide, that's why I'm
streaming writing. Like I wouldn't be
streaming writing. Like I wouldn't be
streaming writing otherwise, right?
streaming writing otherwise, right?
So please tell me that's why I'm
So please tell me that's why I'm
streaming it. Let me get coffee.
The YouTube chat is working, right?
The YouTube chat is working, right?
Because I don't think I've seen a single
Because I don't think I've seen a single
message from YouTube.
Go test that real quick.
Oh, it's not uh it's not working.
Wait, what?
There's a message that just didn't show
There's a message that just didn't show
up.
Starang.
Starang.
I don't know why it does that.
Now it shows up. Oh, was it just now?
Now it shows up. Oh, was it just now?
Okay.
I read the TRPO one and it is intuitive
I read the TRPO one and it is intuitive
if you've done convex opt. Okay. Yeah,
if you've done convex opt. Okay. Yeah,
but here's the thing. like if you've
but here's the thing. like if you've
done convex opt then I don't have to
done convex opt then I don't have to
worry about the math side at all and I
worry about the math side at all and I
can just tell you go read all these
can just tell you go read all these
papers right and then the thing that we
papers right and then the thing that we
have to figure out is the engineering
have to figure out is the engineering
side

I'm writing a guide that's like people
I'm writing a guide that's like people
start at different points right a lot of
start at different points right a lot of
people are going to know either
people are going to know either
engineering or math but not both
teach us RL from basics to advance
teach us RL from basics to advance
Yeah, but what's that mean? Sarang,
Yeah, but what's that mean? Sarang,
right? Like that's what I'm trying to
right? Like that's what I'm trying to
figure out like what gaps I'm missing
figure out like what gaps I'm missing
and stuff. People have not done convex
and stuff. People have not done convex
opt. Oh, I have a fun story about that.
opt. Oh, I have a fun story about that.
So, when I got to Stanford, they uh they
So, when I got to Stanford, they uh they
brought us all into, you know, a big
brought us all into, you know, a big
auditorium and the president gave us
auditorium and the president gave us
this like long- winded speech about how
this like long- winded speech about how
uh Stanford students don't know how to
uh Stanford students don't know how to
fail, right? like you guys have never
fail, right? like you guys have never
failed at anything and you don't know
failed at anything and you don't know
what that's like. So I I took that as a
what that's like. So I I took that as a
challenge. So uh my winter semester I
challenge. So uh my winter semester I
enrolled in a full course load uh plus
enrolled in a full course load uh plus
two graduate courses upper div graduate
two graduate courses upper div graduate
courses one of which was convex
courses one of which was convex
optimization with Steven Boyd which is a
optimization with Steven Boyd which is a
notoriously hard class that has a
notoriously hard class that has a
24-hour long final. The final is written
24-hour long final. The final is written
to take you 24 hours and you have 24
to take you 24 hours and you have 24
hours to do it.
hours to do it.
So yeah, I did not pass that class. Uh,
So yeah, I did not pass that class. Uh,
no, there was not a snowballs chance in
no, there was not a snowballs chance in
hell, but I did learn a bunch of cool
hell, but I did learn a bunch of cool
stuff from it.
Engineering is important. Math can be
Engineering is important. Math can be
done by people like you. I'm not a good
done by people like you. I'm not a good
mathematician at all,
bro.
It was fun. I had a good time with that.
I took the 24hour final right as well. I
I took the 24hour final right as well. I
think I might have gotten like one
think I might have gotten like one
question mostly correct.
It's actually one of my favorite classes
It's actually one of my favorite classes
though because like
though because like
the one thing I learned from convex opt
the one thing I learned from convex opt
that was really useful uh Steven Boyd
that was really useful uh Steven Boyd
gave a great introduction to parto
gave a great introduction to parto
optimality and sensitivity analysis and
optimality and sensitivity analysis and
I have used that everywhere ever since.
I have used that everywhere ever since.
It was like the one really accessible
It was like the one really accessible
piece of that course.
also the problem with like the problem
also the problem with like the problem
with getting too theoretical about a lot
with getting too theoretical about a lot
of this stuff, right, is you write this
of this stuff, right, is you write this
beautiful formula for constrained
beautiful formula for constrained
optimization with TRPO or whatever and
optimization with TRPO or whatever and
then it just doesn't work,
then it just doesn't work,
right? It just doesn't work.
I remember that course was so funny.
I remember that course was so funny.
Boyd said um he said that he used to
Boyd said um he said that he used to
make his final open book and open other
make his final open book and open other
professors. So you used to be able to go
professors. So you used to be able to go
ask other professors for help with his
ask other professors for help with his
final. And he said that he did this to
final. And he said that he did this to
screw with other professors because they
screw with other professors because they
could not take his exam.
This is the reason I lean towards
This is the reason I lean towards
heavier engineering is because basically
heavier engineering is because basically
I was very practical with like all right
I was very practical with like all right
what is the thing I need to know in
what is the thing I need to know in
order to make the thing I want to work
order to make the thing I want to work
work and it was mostly engineering.
work and it was mostly engineering.
At the time I finished his course, I
At the time I finished his course, I
thought SGD was trash and Newton's
thought SGD was trash and Newton's
method is the way to go. Yeah. You know,
method is the way to go. Yeah. You know,
and then like I spent the next several
and then like I spent the next several
years thinking that all optimization
years thinking that all optimization
research was kind of just trolling
research was kind of just trolling
because really not much came out of
because really not much came out of
optimization research for a long time,
optimization research for a long time,
but then Muan came out of left field and
but then Muan came out of left field and
ended up being a huge huge improvement
ended up being a huge huge improvement
for RRL stuff. So like there's actually
for RRL stuff. So like there's actually
legitimate stuff in uh optimizer
legitimate stuff in uh optimizer
research.
You just can't have anything that's like
You just can't have anything that's like
quadratic or n login in um in terms of
quadratic or n login in um in terms of
the number of weights cuz like obviously
the number of weights cuz like obviously
right
Did you take his course at Stanford out
Did you take his course at Stanford out
of curiosity
where I did my undergrad?
I don't know if it's also online.
off to debug poly touring machine. Good
off to debug poly touring machine. Good
luck with that. Holy, I think that's a
luck with that. Holy, I think that's a
new record. We have that's at least 15
new record. We have that's at least 15
people on the stream. Hey everyone,
people on the stream. Hey everyone,
welcome.
welcome.
We are uh
We are uh
trying to finish this guide today so
trying to finish this guide today so
that you all will actually have
that you all will actually have
educational material on RL. I don't do a
educational material on RL. I don't do a
ton of educational material, but it's
ton of educational material, but it's
been highly highly requested. So, I'm
been highly highly requested. So, I'm
trying my best here.
We're kind of uniquely positioned where
We're kind of uniquely positioned where
like
like
RL's actually really easy to get into
RL's actually really easy to get into
with Puffer, but then bridging the gap
with Puffer, but then bridging the gap
between how easy it is in Puffer versus
between how easy it is in Puffer versus
like how you interact with everything
like how you interact with everything
outside of Puffer is kind of hard.
outside of Puffer is kind of hard.
Welcome, Grant.
Welcome, Grant.
Can you give us a glimpse of a prequel
Can you give us a glimpse of a prequel
article just to Yeah. So,
article just to Yeah. So,
there are a few of them.
There are if you look on the docs here
There are if you look on the docs here
or the blog
or the blog
there's this quick start guide which
there's this quick start guide which
just has fundamental terms some
just has fundamental terms some
perspective and some things that I use a
perspective and some things that I use a
lot. This is a lot of about like
lot. This is a lot of about like
intuition and how to view the field.
intuition and how to view the field.
Okay, this is a lot and this links you
Okay, this is a lot and this links you
to resources. This like gives you a lot
to resources. This like gives you a lot
of good resources to read but it doesn't
of good resources to read but it doesn't
actually say read this then read this
actually say read this then read this
then read this then read this. doesn't
then read this then read this. doesn't
give you the introduction like that
give you the introduction like that
which is what I'm doing now. And then
which is what I'm doing now. And then
the other article that I think will
the other article that I think will
launch concurrently with this is we have
launch concurrently with this is we have
uh my programming advice which applies
uh my programming advice which applies
to people who've also been programming
to people who've also been programming
for several years. But just pretty much
for several years. But just pretty much
if the way that you see me writing code
if the way that you see me writing code
on stream looks weird, you should read
on stream looks weird, you should read
this. Um and then there's how to learn
this. Um and then there's how to learn
ML. This is actually really short
ML. This is actually really short
because Stamford CS231N is really really
because Stamford CS231N is really really
good and it's free online and if you
good and it's free online and if you
just take that one course which is very
just take that one course which is very
accessible you're kind of good to go.
accessible you're kind of good to go.
The only other thing that I added here
The only other thing that I added here
which is very important is because you
which is very important is because you
have to read papers in ML like you have
have to read papers in ML like you have
to read papers. You must um I added this
to read papers. You must um I added this
section here which is I think sheds a
section here which is I think sheds a
lot of light on why papers are the way
lot of light on why papers are the way
that they are and should make it a lot
that they are and should make it a lot
easier for people to get into reading
easier for people to get into reading
papers.
Thanks. Yeah.
Thanks. Yeah.
I mean cuz other than that, right,
some of the terms welcome to spinning
some of the terms welcome to spinning
up. So, spinning up is okay. Uh,
up. So, spinning up is okay. Uh,
spinning up is pretty good. The problem
spinning up is pretty good. The problem
with spinning up is it's like 10 times
with spinning up is it's like 10 times
too much math and like the code sucks.
too much math and like the code sucks.
So, it's really like the math is good,
So, it's really like the math is good,
but you don't need that much math to get
but you don't need that much math to get
started. If you have a strong math
started. If you have a strong math
background already and that helps you,
background already and that helps you,
then go for it. Uh, but if you have like
then go for it. Uh, but if you have like
either a more balanced background or a
either a more balanced background or a
more software heavy background, it's not
more software heavy background, it's not
going to help and the code sucks.
going to help and the code sucks.
So, that's tough.
Have you tried SACE?
Have you tried SACE?
Uh, I think people really only use SACE
Uh, I think people really only use SACE
in robotics these days because their
in robotics these days because their
simulators are slow.
simulators are slow.
I haven't actually seen like good
I haven't actually seen like good
evidence for SACE over anything else.
evidence for SACE over anything else.
The thing that people do uh which is
The thing that people do uh which is
really crappy is they always use steps
really crappy is they always use steps
for their Xaxis. So even if one is 10
for their Xaxis. So even if one is 10
times slower than the other, they still
times slower than the other, they still
use steps. Like they treat data as holy
use steps. Like they treat data as holy
and like you can never get any more data
and like you can never get any more data
even though you can.
even though you can.
So I don't think there's much to SACE.
So I don't think there's much to SACE.
I'd have to look more into it. It's also
I'd have to look more into it. It's also
there's problem with discrete spaces
there's problem with discrete spaces
which is annoying.
So I PO has been really good, but then
So I PO has been really good, but then
our version of PO is like our new
our version of PO is like our new
algorithm is a lot better than PO as
algorithm is a lot better than PO as
well. And the key is that it's fast. I
well. And the key is that it's fast. I
can guarantee you that nothing beats
can guarantee you that nothing beats
what we have here on speed. Like on raw
what we have here on speed. Like on raw
speed, ours is the fastest. If you want
speed, ours is the fastest. If you want
to get into sample efficiency, that's
to get into sample efficiency, that's
kind of the open area of research that I
kind of the open area of research that I
have to look into next. Uh the
have to look into next. Uh the
literature out there at the moment is
literature out there at the moment is
very very bad and the reason for that is
very very bad and the reason for that is
obvious, right? So if you're doing this
obvious, right? So if you're doing this
very sample efficient learning where
very sample efficient learning where
your experiments are really slow, you
your experiments are really slow, you
can't run a lot of experiments.
can't run a lot of experiments.
So you're kind of just screwed.
But my hope is that what we can do is we
But my hope is that what we can do is we
can take like the off policy algorithms,
can take like the off policy algorithms,
we can run them in the very high data
we can run them in the very high data
availability regime and see if the off
availability regime and see if the off
policy algorithms do better when you
policy algorithms do better when you
give them a ton of data than on policy
give them a ton of data than on policy
or if they're kind of the same. And then
or if they're kind of the same. And then
when you crank up the data reuse, we'll
when you crank up the data reuse, we'll
see if they diverge and if actually you
see if they diverge and if actually you
can use a lot more compute to get a lot
can use a lot more compute to get a lot
better results or not. Like good
better results or not. Like good
controlled experiments kind of just
controlled experiments kind of just
don't exist for this stuff.
Let's say that the last three of these

What is it?
Maybe should I link Buddy.
No, cuz that's not one of mine.

I think what we do is we link all of

give reasons why you read these
I don't want to link anybody any of my
I don't want to link anybody any of my
own papers to be honest. I kind of hate
own papers to be honest. I kind of hate
all my papers.
Are there any that I think are kind of

Not really at all. Right. Is there a
Not really at all. Right. Is there a
neural MMO 3 paper?

No, there isn't. Right. I didn't write
No, there isn't. Right. I didn't write
one.
Maybe net hack.
I think this one's a good one to read.
I'm trying to think if there are other
I'm trying to think if there are other
papers that I really think like that
papers that I really think like that
should really be included.
You probably should be linked DQN.
Yeah, you should probably be linked DQN.
Oh, go obviously.
Where was the original one? Is it only

I have two free months and I'm looking
I have two free months and I'm looking
to contribute to Puffer AI. Where do you
to contribute to Puffer AI. Where do you
suggest that I start? I have a good RL
suggest that I start? I have a good RL
and programming background. Depends on
and programming background. Depends on
your interests. So, there is heavy
your interests. So, there is heavy
research side stuff to do. there's heavy
research side stuff to do. there's heavy
infrastructure side stuff to do. Uh and
infrastructure side stuff to do. Uh and
we're also looking for like applications
we're also looking for like applications
that are going to be useful in a number
that are going to be useful in a number
of different areas. Okay. So on the
of different areas. Okay. So on the
research side uh and this is a thing
research side uh and this is a thing
that I'm going to start doing quite
that I'm going to start doing quite
soon.
soon.
We're going to have a big comprehensive
We're going to have a big comprehensive
push to look through all of the 2020 era
push to look through all of the 2020 era
and beforeish uh offline methods and see
and beforeish uh offline methods and see
if there is anything to offline methods.
if there is anything to offline methods.
They're kind of a mess and all the
They're kind of a mess and all the
research in the space is like kind of a
research in the space is like kind of a
mess. So, we're probably going to have
mess. So, we're probably going to have
to do some sort of version of Puffarel,
to do some sort of version of Puffarel,
which is our main trainer that does that
which is our main trainer that does that
stuff and like try out all the different
stuff and like try out all the different
components and methods and see what
components and methods and see what
matters and what doesn't. That's one
matters and what doesn't. That's one
huge thing on research side. Um, yeah,
huge thing on research side. Um, yeah,
there's stuff on hyperparameter tuning
there's stuff on hyperparameter tuning
and and other things in research as
and and other things in research as
well. I think that's the main big one
well. I think that's the main big one
though. Let's see. Uh on the
though. Let's see. Uh on the
infrastructure side, we want to actually
infrastructure side, we want to actually
get close uh MFU to what is
get close uh MFU to what is
theoretically possible, right? We want
theoretically possible, right? We want
to get uh close to one on that or 100,
to get uh close to one on that or 100,
however you define it. We haven't
however you define it. We haven't
actually done that stuff formally. As
actually done that stuff formally. As
fast as Puffer is, I think it could be
fast as Puffer is, I think it could be
like two or three times faster yet.
like two or three times faster yet.
Again, if we were to optimize that
Again, if we were to optimize that
stuff, there is also other related
stuff, there is also other related
infrastructure things we can do with
infrastructure things we can do with
optimizing uh data transfer from CPU to
optimizing uh data transfer from CPU to
GPU. And then on the applications and
GPU. And then on the applications and
environment side, there are a couple
environment side, there are a couple
things there. Uh on one hand, like
things there. Uh on one hand, like
there's the idea of designing probe
there's the idea of designing probe
environments to help us with our
environments to help us with our
algorithmic research, but then there's
algorithmic research, but then there's
also the idea of like just going out and
also the idea of like just going out and
finding hard problems in industry that
finding hard problems in industry that
could be solved with fast sim and trying
could be solved with fast sim and trying
to do that. That is also the way that
to do that. That is also the way that
you get involved with the business side
you get involved with the business side
of Puffer.
We do all of like all the research is
We do all of like all the research is
managed via the Discord. So,
managed via the Discord. So,

You'd have to come up with something
You'd have to come up with something
that that actually lets you do that's

cuz right now like the have a chatbot

I I mean I don't even know if it does

Like if I give you 03 on a phone, does

that actually do anything
advisor and coach? it was the right
advisor and coach? it was the right
thing to tell me in the moment. Yeah,
thing to tell me in the moment. Yeah,
the thing is that um the LLMs, they kind
the thing is that um the LLMs, they kind
of just lie half the time.

So
yeah,
yeah,
they're very good at giving you coherent
they're very good at giving you coherent

Like half the time you'll ask something

Advisers and especially coaches aren't

pure oracles of truth either. Yeah. No,
pure oracles of truth either. Yeah. No,
but this one's particularly bad.
I mean, I could see in a couple of
I mean, I could see in a couple of
generations them being very useful, but

at the moment they kind of just aren't
Yeah, they just gaslight you. Exactly.
Yeah, they just gaslight you. Exactly.
They're kind of bad.
Like honestly, everybody shits on

I don't use this, and maybe I should,

but like uh is the effect of

Like something like this is I think

they're overrated?
No. I mean, I think LLMs are very good.
No. I mean, I think LLMs are very good.
And I think that there's like a one in

three chance that LM solve everything.
They're just incredibly incredibly

overhyped right now, though. And it's

just all ignoring because that doesn't

help us raise money.
I do use LLMs in like a fair bit of my
I do use LLMs in like a fair bit of my
work. I just don't like copy paste

blocks of generated code and I'm very

very careful when I use them as sources

for stuff because again half the stuff

My personal best probability estimate. I

don't know.
But do you think that's too high or too

low?
I mean it's the fact that like

humans are really really bad at

estimating exponential scaling. So like
it is possible that a lot of the things

that's just actually amazing.

why the hell can't an LLM go teach

But like it seems like the LLMs, it's
