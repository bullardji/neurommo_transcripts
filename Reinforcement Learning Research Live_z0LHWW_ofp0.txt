And so far with 0.1 randomization,

it actually just kind of works.
Can I like just crank this thing up a

All right.
Okay. Error. Drone race.
Okay, we're training.
So the question is going to be whether

Now,
hey Sam,

welcome back.

I probably should just put this on the U

I think I'll do that next.
Okay. Interestingly, we're stuck at um
Okay. Interestingly, we're stuck at um
stuck at like 75ish.
And the new one
You sorted it anyways.
You sorted it anyways.
Cool.
So, this is like super heavily

randomized.
This is definitely better than the model
This is definitely better than the model
that we had trained before, even if it

doesn't have 100% success rate.
Yeah, like some of those are like you
Yeah, like some of those are like you
can tell that didn't control well at

Yeah. So I mean this is crazy
Yeah. So I mean this is crazy
randomization like gravity can be 50%

Might have to rewe pipers. Might need a
Might have to rewe pipers. Might need a
bigger network. We might need to make it

I don't know if we should let it observe
I don't know if we should let it observe
the coefficients. Honestly,
the coefficients. Honestly,
I honestly like it'll probably do better
I honestly like it'll probably do better
if we let it observe its coefficients,
if we let it observe its coefficients,
but like you're not going to be able to
but like you're not going to be able to
observe the coefficients correctly on
observe the coefficients correctly on
the real end. So, it's probably better
the real end. So, it's probably better
to not let it.
Yeah, you can see sometimes it's like
Yeah, you can see sometimes it's like
super agile and sometimes super
super agile and sometimes super
sluggish.
So, I mean, pretty much if this doesn't
So, I mean, pretty much if this doesn't
work on a real drone, it just means like
work on a real drone, it just means like
we didn't randomize a variable that's
we didn't randomize a variable that's

this thing can barely fly. Say
if I just do 0.25, it might just work

out of the box

like
Let's see if it works with this.
cuz I think we'll just be able to
cuz I think we'll just be able to
estimate everything to within 25%.
10 to 15%. Yeah. The one thing I do kind
10 to 15%. Yeah. The one thing I do kind
of want to mess with. So, let's do this
of want to mess with. So, let's do this
first and then I I think we're going to
first and then I I think we're going to
have to mess with DT, right?
have to mess with DT, right?
like the delta time is going to change
like the delta time is going to change
per step.
How big is our DT right now?
That's too small, isn't it? If this is
That's too small, isn't it? If this is
in seconds,
it's 0.02.
Yeah. So, this controls way better.
Yeah. So, this controls way better.
like 93%.
And this should still have enough
And this should still have enough
randomization in it.
Yeah, you can see how screwy this drone
Yeah, you can see how screwy this drone
is controlling in here.
is controlling in here.
You can see it's like super screwy
You can see it's like super screwy
controls, right?
Yeah, that's very different here. It's
Yeah, that's very different here. It's
like way smoother.
like way smoother.
It's got like more inertia to it.
What happens if I make this like
if I make this 0.1? Does it break?
So this would be like 100 ms latency.
So this would be like 100 ms latency.
or not really latency
or not really latency
but 100 ms precision
but 100 ms precision
which would be very bad control.
Yeah. So this doesn't do anything like
Yeah. So this doesn't do anything like
this. It wasn't trained to. Let's see if
this. It wasn't trained to. Let's see if
it can actually train at 100 ms.
Oh, it's having a tough time.
No, it's it's actually picking up.
Huh.
number to hit is 93%.
Oh yeah, this is completely fine. So
Oh yeah, this is completely fine. So
yeah, pretty much scratch that guys.
yeah, pretty much scratch that guys.
Like any any control frequency you get

should kind of be okay.
Actually, this literally does better.

Well, you can see here I have it flying

with a DT of 0.1.
It's flying very weirdly though.
What do you think is realistically the

deal with? Like 50 ms.

We should be able to get 20 Hz control,
We should be able to get 20 Hz control,
right?
Yeah, let's do let's get like a 20 Hz
Yeah, let's do let's get like a 20 Hz

and we'll see how this does
and we'll see how this does
because like this is solving

I don't know. I mean, realistically, it

It wouldn't be the first time RL does

50 Hz could be reasonable, but we can
50 Hz could be reasonable, but we can
definitely solve it with 50 Hz.
Let me see if I can solve it with 20 and

get something that looks like decent.
get something that looks like decent.
Cuz if it solves at 20, then it'll solve

at 50.
If it doesn't look reasonable, we'll go

This looks fairly good to me.
Like this definitely has more realistic

Like, can we get this to fly big drones

So you scale the mass with size cubed.
You scale arm length linearly with size.

like we're going to randomize

No. I guess I kind of
No. I guess I kind of

We'll try it like this first.
Find base.
I
Okay. So this is the base inertia.
The hope here is that we'll be able to
The hope here is that we'll be able to

like slim down the RNG requirements. So,
we won't have like crazy things that

Oh, it's actually base.
I don't need to divide by this, do I?
Let's get the rest of these done first.
Let's get the rest of these done first.
So thrust coefficient should scale with

it's the RNG
angular damping scales with inertia

going to be this base.
All right.
and drag scale with size.
We can let gravity be.
We can let gravity be what it's going to
We can let gravity be what it's going to
be for now.
That is exact

We'll just we'll give it a one center

just cuz
just cuz
it doesn't make a difference, I'm sure,
it doesn't make a difference, I'm sure,
but we'll do it anyways.

inversely proportional to size. That's
inversely proportional to size. That's
not true, right?
not true, right?
The max RPM is determined by the motors.
The max RPM is determined by the motors.
So that's frock being stupid.
If anything, you'd want to have
speed should be directly proportional to
speed should be directly proportional to
thrust. Yeah.
thrust. Yeah.
Wait, but what's why is there a max RPM
Wait, but what's why is there a max RPM
anyways?
Let's just go study the physics a little
Let's just go study the physics a little
bit here.
Okay. So, these are thrusts, right?
Okay. So, these are thrusts, right?
Motor thrusts,
drone K thrust.
Oh, you probably don't need this RPM
Oh, you probably don't need this RPM
thing. I'm going to ask Finn and Sam if

you need a max RPM thing.
you need a max RPM thing.
I think you can probably just model this
I think you can probably just model this
as thrust, right?
I believe you can.
I believe you can.
Let's just do this.
And then likewise
is the maximum velocity also not modeled
is the maximum velocity also not modeled
by this.
Yeah. So the maximums should be modeled
Yeah. So the maximums should be modeled
perfectly by the physics
perfectly by the physics
I believe.
assuming you have the drag

which is proportional to your velocity.
That's going to create a maximum, isn't
That's going to create a maximum, isn't
it?
it?
That's going to create a maximum. Cool.
That's going to create a maximum. Cool.
So, all I have to do is fix this uh this
So, all I have to do is fix this uh this
total mess that I have here. And we
total mess that I have here. And we
should be able to get a nice
should be able to get a nice
a nicely scaled uh drone randomizer.
a nicely scaled uh drone randomizer.
And we'll actually be able to visually
And we'll actually be able to visually
see this too once it's done that like
see this too once it's done that like
we'll be able to visually see that we
we'll be able to visually see that we
have larger drones, smaller drones.
So
So
we give it the size. Size is going to be
we give it the size. Size is going to be
divi a factor of two
of mass scale.
Okay. So this is going to be scales.
Okay. So this is going to be scales.
So mass scales
cubic with arm length.
Another
word to do this is um
word to do this is um
m proportional
x cubed
And then we do
I
I

So we just do float
So we just do float

So you do arm length squared.
So you do arm length squared.
from mass

My x is going to be

I don't feel great about having um the
I don't feel great about having um the
inertia moments being so screwy,

but it's fine.
but it's fine.
We'll let them we'll uh we'll let Spit
We'll let them we'll uh we'll let Spit
Sam and Finn take a look at whether this
Sam and Finn take a look at whether this
modeling makes any sense.
And then
The thrust really isn't proportional to
The thrust really isn't proportional to
much of anything, right?
Do we just assume it's proportional to
Do we just assume it's proportional to
mass?
I'm going to assume it's proportional to
I'm going to assume it's proportional to
mass and then I'll double check.
Okay,
angular damping.
angular damping skills. Inertia
It's
Okay. So, this is good.
Okay. So, this is good.
And then just drag
And then just drag
drag scales differently.
drag scales differently.
Uh what is the drag formula? Is it

what's linear drag scale with?
what's linear drag scale with?
Isn't it just
negative B

v? Yeah, it's just velocity. It doesn't
v? Yeah, it's just velocity. It doesn't
scale with mass. stupid.
Well, it depends how they've done it.
Well, it depends how they've done it.
Let me just double check their formula.
Let me just double check their formula.
No, they've done it correctly. They've
No, they've done it correctly. They've
got B and V. Yeah, it's multiplied by
got B and V. Yeah, it's multiplied by
velocity.
So, it's just proportional to velocity.
Oh yeah. So this is
but this is just the coefficient.
So this doesn't get multiplied by
So this doesn't get multiplied by
anything. The coefficient is just the
anything. The coefficient is just the
coefficient.
Isn't it proportional to wave? Is it not
Isn't it proportional to wave? Is it not
proportional to size?
It should be proportional to the area,
It should be proportional to the area,
right? Which is size squared.
How do you model that?
Do we say it's proportional to size
Do we say it's proportional to size
squared?
And then they have this clamping term
And then they have this clamping term
these uh these clamping terms
which we will see what happens without
which we will see what happens without

these.
All right. So, all we have to do now, we

should have the proportionalities right.
should have the proportionalities right.
We just have to make sure the constants
We just have to make sure the constants

But they shouldn't be though.
That's sides.
We're going to do everything from

the only thing I use that touches any of

it depends what I'm working on.
Okay. So here we have we're at the break
Okay. So here we have we're at the break

density is 0.5 Five.
Okay, so we get nams into this thing now
Okay, so we get nams into this thing now
with the new formula somehow.
Oh, it's because of this duh right here.
Uh oh, I see. So,
Uh oh, I see. So,
okay, it does make sense to use RPM then

I guess
I see I So, I'm wrong here. It actually

max RPM
because it's like quadratic and
because it's like quadratic and
apparently that's the thing you're
apparently that's the thing you're
setting is the RPM directly,

not the torqus.
So we'll restore this
Let's
say something.
Uh, if the last person here in the chat

is not a bot, please type potato.
I'm getting bot vibes from the first

Do we just make max RPM scale with like
Do we just make max RPM scale with like
um
like square root of size or something?

No.
No.
Do we just make it scale to size?
Well, let's just guess something for
Well, let's just guess something for
now.
We'll do size square.
All right.
All right.
So, this gives us RPM.
And we're still getting
And we're still getting
we're still getting undefined behavior.
Okay, this is a nan
because RPM is nan
because the actions is a nan.
How' nan get into actions?
Something blew up.
It's
okay. We do get ns.
It's probably like max velocity going
It's probably like max velocity going
infinite or something, right?

Let's just put max velocity back on for

We'll just do um
We'll just do um
we'll just do like this for now. Yeah.
And we'll just like keep it. Let's say

we'll just like keep it for stability.
Okay. So, they're crazy drones in this

We should also make the rings.
We should also make the rings.
Change the rings a little bit.
What?

Why does this take void?
I didn't even know you could do that.
I didn't even know you could do that.
That's weird.
We have to do a few small things I think

ring is completely a weird size.
Let's do this.
Yes, this arm length is not remotely

So, the box is 10 m by 10 m at the

Okay, let's do the randomizations now.
What happens if I do 0.5?
Ah, so we can see that basically

scaling formulas are wrong because all I

did was make the drone bigger and now it

doesn't control right. So, we got to

figure out what I did wrong with that
Okay. So if I make it scale here with um
with X.
This is slightly better, right?

if I just do 0.25, it might just work
if I just do 0.25, it might just work
out of the box

like
Let's see if it works with this.
cuz I think we'll just be able to
cuz I think we'll just be able to
estimate everything to within 25%.
10 to 15%. Yeah. The one thing I do kind
10 to 15%. Yeah. The one thing I do kind
of want to mess with. So, let's do this
of want to mess with. So, let's do this
first and then I I think we're going to
first and then I I think we're going to
have to mess with DT, right?
have to mess with DT, right?
like the delta time is going to change
like the delta time is going to change
per step.
How big is our DT right now?
That's too small, isn't it? If this is
That's too small, isn't it? If this is
in seconds,
it's 0.02.
Yeah. So, this controls way better.
Yeah. So, this controls way better.
like 93%.
And this should still have enough
And this should still have enough
randomization in it.
Yeah, you can see how screwy this drone
Yeah, you can see how screwy this drone
is controlling in here.
is controlling in here.
You can see it's like super screwy
You can see it's like super screwy
controls, right?
Yeah, that's very different here. It's
Yeah, that's very different here. It's
like way smoother.
like way smoother.
It's got like more inertia to it.
What happens if I make this like
if I make this 0.1? Does it break?
So this would be like 100 ms latency.
So this would be like 100 ms latency.
or not really latency
or not really latency
but 100 ms precision
but 100 ms precision
which would be very bad control.
Yeah. So this doesn't do anything like
Yeah. So this doesn't do anything like
this. It wasn't trained to. Let's see if
this. It wasn't trained to. Let's see if
it can actually train at 100 ms.
Oh, it's having a tough time.
No, it's it's actually picking up.
Huh.
number to hit is 93%.
Oh yeah, this is completely fine. So
Oh yeah, this is completely fine. So
yeah, pretty much scratch that guys.
yeah, pretty much scratch that guys.
Like any any control frequency you get

It's flying very weirdly though.
What do you think is realistically the

We should be able to get 20 Hz control,

50 Hz could be reasonable, but we can

So that's frock being stupid.
If anything, you'd want to have

thrust. Yeah.
Wait, but what's why is there a max RPM
Wait, but what's why is there a max RPM
anyways?
Let's just go study the physics a little

you need a max RPM thing.
I think you can probably just model this

I believe you can.
I believe you can.
Let's just do this.
And then likewise
is the maximum velocity also not modeled

Yeah. So the maximums should be modeled

That's going to create a maximum, isn't

it?
That's going to create a maximum. Cool.
That's going to create a maximum. Cool.
So, all I have to do is fix this uh this
So, all I have to do is fix this uh this
total mess that I have here. And we
total mess that I have here. And we
should be able to get a nice

And we'll actually be able to visually

see this too once it's done that like
see this too once it's done that like
we'll be able to visually see that we

So
So
we give it the size. Size is going to be
we give it the size. Size is going to be
divi a factor of two
of mass scale.
Okay. So this is going to be scales.
Okay. So this is going to be scales.
So mass scales

Another
word to do this is um
word to do this is um
m proportional

And then we do

So we just do float

So you do arm length squared.
So you do arm length squared.

I don't feel great about having um the

We'll let them we'll uh we'll let Spit

Sam and Finn take a look at whether this
Sam and Finn take a look at whether this
modeling makes any sense.
And then
The thrust really isn't proportional to
The thrust really isn't proportional to
much of anything, right?
Do we just assume it's proportional to
Do we just assume it's proportional to

I'm going to assume it's proportional to
I'm going to assume it's proportional to

Okay,
angular damping.
angular damping skills. Inertia
It's

And then just drag
And then just drag
drag scales differently.
drag scales differently.
Uh what is the drag formula? Is it

what's linear drag scale with?
Isn't it just

Well, it depends how they've done it.

No, they've done it correctly. They've
No, they've done it correctly. They've
got B and V. Yeah, it's multiplied by
got B and V. Yeah, it's multiplied by
velocity.
So, it's just proportional to velocity.
Oh yeah. So this is
but this is just the coefficient.
So this doesn't get multiplied by
So this doesn't get multiplied by
anything. The coefficient is just the
anything. The coefficient is just the
coefficient.
Isn't it proportional to wave? Is it not
Isn't it proportional to wave? Is it not
proportional to size?
It should be proportional to the area,
It should be proportional to the area,
right? Which is size squared.
How do you model that?
Do we say it's proportional to size
Do we say it's proportional to size
squared?
And then they have this clamping term
And then they have this clamping term
these uh these clamping terms
which we will see what happens without

these.
All right. So, all we have to do now, we

should have the proportionalities right.
We just have to make sure the constants

That's sides.
We're going to do everything from

No.
Do we just make it scale to size?
Well, let's just guess something for

We'll do size square.
All right.
All right.
So, this gives us RPM.
And we're still getting
And we're still getting
we're still getting undefined behavior.
Okay, this is a nan
because RPM is nan
because the actions is a nan.
How' nan get into actions?
Something blew up.
It's
okay. We do get ns.
It's probably like max velocity going

Let's just put max velocity back on for

We'll just do um

we'll just do like this for now. Yeah.
And we'll just like keep it. Let's say

We should also make the rings.
We should also make the rings.
Change the rings a little bit.
What?

Why does this take void?
I didn't even know you could do that.

going to find a big contract in either

control because this is what we're
control because this is what we're
really good at doing now. And uh the
really good at doing now. And uh the
hope is that we can eventually do
hope is that we can eventually do
like material sim, but that doesn't mean
like material sim, but that doesn't mean
we can't spend any time like looking
we can't spend any time like looking
into what's feasible in material sim
into what's feasible in material sim
now, right? And I'd really like to do
now, right? And I'd really like to do
that cuz if there is something that's
that cuz if there is something that's
actually super feasible, we can just do
actually super feasible, we can just do
it. If it's the type of thing that we
it. If it's the type of thing that we
need to scale up to, then at least we'd
need to scale up to, then at least we'd
like to know now like the type of things
like to know now like the type of things
that we will need to scale for and build
that we will need to scale for and build
around it.
The neural nets are really simple around

like the neural net architectures are

not that complicated that we use.
not that complicated that we use.
It's mostly about the environment

and the data and then just making

everything really fast.
everything really fast.
It's like the biggest the biggest thing
It's like the biggest the biggest thing
with RL.
What if we do this?
Is the drone just smaller now?
Is the drone just smaller now?
Oh, yeah. The drone's tiny now. Yeah.
definitely hit you definitely update you
definitely hit you definitely update you
on the material sim two weeks at most

I mean we definitely want to do stuff in
I mean we definitely want to do stuff in
that space here let's put it this way as
that space here let's put it this way as
well right so if you find something that
well right so if you find something that
we can simulate
we can simulate
uh that will actually like do something
uh that will actually like do something
useful and basically any materials
useful and basically any materials
there's chem space
there's chem space
Uh, and there's actually like, you know,
Uh, and there's actually like, you know,
contract opportunities that come out of
contract opportunities that come out of
that. We will bring you in on that. So,
that. We will bring you in on that. So,
this is pretty much the way that it
this is pretty much the way that it
works with all the open- source stuff,
works with all the open- source stuff,
right? Is that like everything's kind of
right? Is that like everything's kind of
out in the open for the most part, but
out in the open for the most part, but
like if you have knowledge of another
like if you have knowledge of another
area that creates opportunities for us

to throw our tech on a new area, then
to throw our tech on a new area, then
we're absolutely interested in bringing
we're absolutely interested in bringing
people in on that. It's just that we do
people in on that. It's just that we do
it via contracts instead of via via

hiring because it's a lot more
hiring because it's a lot more
guaranteed for everyone around that way.
Where the heck is the body?
Okay, there's our grown back. It's just
Okay, there's our grown back. It's just
tiny.

Let me show you the Discord channel.
Let me show you the Discord channel.
Discuss papers.
Discuss papers.
Let's find this version.
Let's find this version.
Yeah, that's fine. You can do that.
Should
be good to hear.
be good to hear.
It's just that the drone is tiny. Yeah.
If the drone is this big,
If the drone is this big,
what do we make? How big do we make the
what do we make? How big do we make the
hoop?
Is that a big enough hoop?
Yeah, I think that this is good.
And it's still zippy. It's just like
And it's still zippy. It's just like
it's just being rendered at the correct
it's just being rendered at the correct
uh the correct scale now. Oh, and the
uh the correct scale now. Oh, and the
rings are like hard.
Okay, let's do the randomizations now.
What happens if I do 0.5?
Ah, so we can see that basically
Ah, so we can see that basically
immediately from this, right? The
immediately from this, right? The
scaling formulas are wrong because all I
scaling formulas are wrong because all I
did was make the drone bigger and now it
did was make the drone bigger and now it
doesn't control right. So, we got to
doesn't control right. So, we got to
figure out what I did wrong with that
Okay. So if I make it scale here with um
with X.
This is slightly better, right?
and I should be able to train something
and I should be able to train something
on this.
There you go. Let me go join that.
Is this a new DM or something? Where did
Is this a new DM or something? Where did
you send this to me?
you send this to me?
Do you put it in puffer or something?
Where'd you send it?
this trains.
this trains.
Oops.
It's pretty zippy, but it trains, right?
Sent on puffer previously.

Did you receive the link to the channel?
Did you receive the link to the channel?
No. Did you DM it to me?
No. Did you DM it to me?
Wait,
I don't see any new message requests.
Like, where did you stick the link?
just stick it on the p like stick the
just stick it on the p like stick the
invite link on the the Discord or
invite link on the the Discord or
something or DM it to me on Discord if

you want

Okay, something weird happened.
Okay. So, this breaks

Not able to find a spot for the ring.
Oh yeah, cuz the rings are going to be

You realize like I have open DMs, right?
Cool.

Oh, you made like a full Discord for
