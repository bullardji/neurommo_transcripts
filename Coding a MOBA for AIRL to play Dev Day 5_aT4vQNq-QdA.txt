okay well view count is working again so

anyways let's go check the dock
we don't have the

hard we got this we got this not doing

that would be a smart thing to do

wouldn't even be that bad

linear pathing cuz that's just a look up

right I'm not going to do that right now
right I'm not going to do that right now
cuz that's actually a fair bit of work

um but yeah that's a great
idea I think we could even do that as a

can just have a a python script that

takes in the map it'll return an array

will you have like you know the the move
will you have like you know the the move
that you want to take or whatever
yeah it's literally just returns an
array I don't know why I didn't think of
array I don't know why I didn't think of
pre-computing pathing that's a very good
pre-computing pathing that's a very good
suggestion
and then we won't have to change the map
and then we won't have to change the map
at all we'll be able to use the exact

is it like as soon as you step into the

actually vision checks and stuff huh
that's hard
