All right, it's back
live
live
here. And we keep working on
terraform. Yeah. So, that does really
terraform. Yeah. So, that does really
freaking well that uh that eval. But
freaking well that uh that eval. But
presumably somewhere just like within
presumably somewhere just like within
some small number of variations.
some small number of variations.
Yeah, there's there's we I can sweep it
Yeah, there's there's we I can sweep it
sub 16,000. Yeah, this so this was
sub 16,000. Yeah, this so this was
trained with
trained with
uh eight and then now this is eval with
uh eight and then now this is eval with
32 which is
amusing. Yeah, they're
terraforming like they're working on
terraforming like they're working on
it. Go worker bees.
it. Go worker bees.
You said 32 now. I think they're 32 in
You said 32 now. I think they're 32 in
here. They're like working on this
here. They're like working on this
island
here. And this one down at the bottom. I
here. And this one down at the bottom. I
still think they're stacking too high.
still think they're stacking too high.
Right here. They are for sure. On on
Right here. They are for sure. On on
middle left. Yeah, right here. Middle
middle left. Yeah, right here. Middle
left definitely.
From a shader perspective, what should
From a shader perspective, what should
it look after they've taken away all of
it look after they've taken away all of
the hill of the existing? If that's the
the hill of the existing? If that's the
goal. Should it be dark? It's like the
goal. Should it be dark? It's like the
moss green that it currently is on the

Think that it's

under. I mean, they're
under. I mean, they're
trying here. Let's rerun this full
trying here. Let's rerun this full
training now with the 32 agents.
Oh, I thought that was the 32. No, we
Oh, I thought that was the 32. No, we
trained to eight and eval 32.
trained to eight and eval 32.
Oh, okay.
Okay. Well, it's way faster to start up
Okay. Well, it's way faster to start up
now, which is nice.
Oh, you know what? I bet you they can't
Oh, you know what? I bet you they can't
see the delta very
see the delta very
well. I think I figured out why they're
well. I think I figured out why they're
stacking too
high. So,
high. So,
like it's target map.
minus
map. So if target map is lower, this
map. So if target map is lower, this
becomes a negative number and then this
becomes a negative number and then this
gets put into a
char. So you think it's being
char. So you think it's being
constrained too much?
I think it should be like
I think it should be like
120 or 128. It should be like
one something like
one something like
this. We'll try before and after with
this. You see, I think it was not I
this. You see, I think it was not I
think it was missing half the delta.
Uh hello. Hey, how's it going?
Uh hello. Hey, how's it going?
Good. Um so I was able to find the bug
Good. Um so I was able to find the bug
and why that is happening with like the
and why that is happening with like the
num ends uh numb workers I mean. Um and
num ends uh numb workers I mean. Um and
it seems to be like a bigger issue than
it seems to be like a bigger issue than
just numb uh yeah it's probably a
just numb uh yeah it's probably a
parsing bug, right?
parsing bug, right?
It's a it's a it well it applies to any
It's a it's a it well it applies to any
argument that is two types of uh that
argument that is two types of uh that
can be two types uh two data types. So
can be two types uh two data types. So
with for example with um num workers it
with for example with um num workers it
can be a string which is auto or it can
can be a string which is auto or it can
be an int. Um and the problem you're
be an int. Um and the problem you're
having specifically with the weird you
having specifically with the weird you
get what I'm saying? Huh?
get what I'm saying? Huh?
That's weird because you're you're
That's weird because you're you're
parsing it. So when you have the default
parsing it. So when you have the default
config. Yeah, I see. Cuz then you add
config. Yeah, I see. Cuz then you add
the type in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
the type in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
That's super obnoxious.
That's super obnoxious.
Mhm. I will I don't know what to do
Mhm. I will I don't know what to do
about that. I'll have to think of what
about that. I'll have to think of what
to do. That That's kind of I I I don't
to do. That That's kind of I I I don't
think I can bring like I I can band-aid
think I can bring like I I can band-aid
fix it, but it's not really like I think
fix it, but it's not really like I think
I'll
I'll
just I'll probably just have to as

literally bal again or something.
literally bal again or something.
Well, no, because well, that's the
Well, no, because well, that's the
thing. You are um getting a second time.
Also, terraforming with 32 bulldozers.
Also, terraforming with 32 bulldozers.
Oh, let me see that. I'll pull up your
Oh, let me see that. I'll pull up your
stream real quick. Oh, you're sh
stream real quick. Oh, you're sh
screening. Okay. You know, I'm not fully
screening. Okay. You know, I'm not fully
convinced it's doing better.
Well, we didn't fix the ops yet either.
Well, we didn't fix the ops yet either.
It's Look, it's building over here. Look
It's Look, it's building over here. Look
at this. It's filling in this island.
I can't I can't see your cursor. And
I can't I can't see your cursor. And
this one. Oh, that's a Discord bug.
this one. Oh, that's a Discord bug.
Cursor, I guess, is on stream.
Cursor, I guess, is on stream.
Yeah, because the bet also had that
Yeah, because the bet also had that
issue. I guess it's a Linux thing cuz uh
issue. I guess it's a Linux thing cuz uh
we're both like you're using uh Ubuntu,
we're both like you're using uh Ubuntu,
I'm using Debian.
I'm using Debian.
Okay, we're going to do this again. Uh
Okay, we're going to do this again. Uh
and now hopefully So can you explain the
and now hopefully So can you explain the
your obs change? I don't understand like
your obs change? I don't understand like
how that would have made a difference.
how that would have made a difference.
I did like target minus uh source
I did like target minus uh source
uh and then I I scale it from 0 to 255
uh and then I I scale it from 0 to 255
and then it gets assigned to an unsigned
and then it gets assigned to an unsigned
char.
char.
Okay. So if it's negative then it just
Okay. So if it's negative then it just
gets cropped to zero or possibly
gets cropped to zero or possibly
undefined behavior.
because char can only be 0 to
285. So, how did you go about fixing
285. So, how did you go about fixing
that? Did you subtract it by 128 to
that? Did you subtract it by 128 to
start?
start?
Yeah, kind of. Um, now to be fair,
Yeah, kind of. Um, now to be fair,
technically we could just
technically we could just
go we could do a sign char instead of a
go we could do a sign char instead of a
unsigned char, which is int 8. That
unsigned char, which is int 8. That
might be the better
effect. We'll see if it does any
effect. We'll see if it does any
better. Should make them stop
better. Should make them stop
overstacking.
at a low level. Is that what casting
at a low level. Is that what casting
from float to char does automatically
from float to char does automatically
like the cast function?
like the cast function?
Well, it's got to produce a valid char,
Well, it's got to produce a valid char,
right? It just divi it just divides it
right? It just divi it just divides it
into that range of values. It doesn't.
into that range of values. It doesn't.
It just it it'll round by default.
I actually manually scale it to get it
I actually manually scale it to get it
into the reasonable range.
So what we can do
So what we can do
with so you know I mean so from what I
with so you know I mean so from what I
see like you are using auto as like a
see like you are using auto as like a
trigger to an if statement a lot of
trigger to an if statement a lot of
times like that's how you use
times like that's how you use
auto.
auto.
So what you can do
So what you can do
is I'm interested to know how much you
is I'm interested to know how much you
are using auto.
are using auto.
Um let me search. So let's
do okay. So using it
here. Auto. No no like this. Yeah.
photo. Okay. You were using it
photo. Okay. You were using it
here. Yeah.
So, yeah.
So, no idea from what I see.
See if that scale.
See if that scale.
The average batch of data is now only
The average batch of data is now only
coming from one
environment and 32 32 agents.
What?
What?
When you see n equals 32, there 32
When you see n equals 32, there 32
agents in one end. It means that that
agents in one end. It means that that
log is just like one ep one environment
log is just like one ep one environment
episode worth of data.
No, they get average. So it should be 32
No, they get average. So it should be 32
32 agents.
N doesn't get averaged.
Uh and GPU drive it's the same thing
Uh and GPU drive it's the same thing
too. But I set up 1024 agents. N is
too. But I set up 1024 agents. N is
1024. Even if I have 16 workers and 16
1024. Even if I have 16 workers and 16
copies

getting all the logs at the same time.
But so look at this. But you're saying
But so look at this. But you're saying
it should be a multiple. Oh, that looks
it should be a multiple. Oh, that looks
better. That looks better.
I'm think I'm seeing less stacking.
I'm think I'm seeing less stacking.
There shouldn't be any now.
There shouldn't be any now.
I don't see anything.
I don't see anything.
I'm questioning middle right a little
I'm questioning middle right a little
bit
bit
maybe, but it might just be filling it
maybe, but it might just be filling it
in and that is the high point that's
in and that is the high point that's
necessary.
Why they don't fill in these like other
Why they don't fill in these like other
islands down at the bottom?
islands down at the bottom?
You think they're just too far? Could
You think they're just too far? Could
be. Like it just doesn't see it and it's
be. Like it just doesn't see it and it's
like screw down here. This and that.
like screw down here. This and that.
There's easier reward otherwise
maybe now. They should be filling stuff
maybe now. They should be filling stuff
in. It feels like they've kind of slowed
down. There a bunch of them
stuck. They get unstuck though
stuck. They get unstuck though
automatically anyways. Maybe that's it.
automatically anyways. Maybe that's it.
Maybe they just keep going to like try
Maybe they just keep going to like try
to put the stuff in and they get
to put the stuff in and they get
stuck. Oh, there's some stacking at the
stuck. Oh, there's some stacking at the
top top left or middle left. Yeah, I see
top top left or middle left. Yeah, I see
that. They're building tower of babel.
that. They're building tower of babel.
Working on
Working on
it.
Yeah, I think the odds that Babel was
Yeah, I think the odds that Babel was
created as part of the target is
created as part of the target is
extremely low.
Actually, sentient.
Yeah, dude. We're building aliens now on
Yeah, dude. We're building aliens now on
Mars.
Mars.
It turns out Puffer just built first AGI
It turns out Puffer just built first AGI
with a 100K 150k parameter network or
with a 100K 150k parameter network or
whatever 166K is this
network. I mean isn't like most of
network. I mean isn't like most of
robotics RL?
robotics RL?
Yeah, good chunk of it.
Yeah, good chunk of it.
Yeah. So, I mean, it's probably a good
Yeah. So, I mean, it's probably a good
um guess that like the Mars rover and
um guess that like the Mars rover and
all that is probably Arald or something.
all that is probably Arald or something.
No, they don't. They they are like super
No, they don't. They they are like super
super like tightly tight uh tightly
super like tightly tight uh tightly
coded classic control, I'm pretty sure.
coded classic control, I'm pretty sure.
So, like you can't debug your RL. Yeah,
So, like you can't debug your RL. Yeah,
you can't debug your RL when it breaks
you can't debug your RL when it breaks
on Mars. Yeah. Yeah, good point. Yeah.
on Mars. Yeah. Yeah, good point. Yeah.
They have like ridiculously defensive
They have like ridiculously defensive
coding guidelines. Like you can't like
coding guidelines. Like you can't like
you can't have an if statement else or
you can't have an if statement else or
something. No recursion too. uh [ __ ]
something. No recursion too. uh [ __ ]
recursion anyways. But like yeah,
you know, one concept I was thinking of
you know, one concept I was thinking of
is I don't know if it is relevant, but
is I don't know if it is relevant, but
if we ranked areas to start targets in
I I actually don't understand why
I I actually don't understand why
there's like nothing on like this
there's like nothing on like this
island.
island.
Like there's many of these islands that
Like there's many of these islands that
they're just ignoring entirely.
they're just ignoring entirely.
Yeah. I don't know why that it could be
Yeah. I don't know why that it could be
an ops
bug. Yeah, they should be filling this
bug. Yeah, they should be filling this
thing in. So like
there's quite possibly
there's quite possibly
obs. I mean
obs. I mean
like this whole island like they're
like this whole island like they're
filling in. You see it's getting lighter
filling in. You see it's getting lighter
green because it's getting shallower and
green because it's getting shallower and
then they just ignore this one. And
then they just ignore this one. And
they're still making tower babble over
they're still making tower babble over
here. This one for some reason. I wonder
here. This one for some reason. I wonder
if there's a reason that they're doing
if there's a reason that they're doing
that. They should be getting negative
that. They should be getting negative
reward.
reward.
Yep. Same thing is happening in batch
Yep. Same thing is happening in batch
size like with the string thing. Bugs
size like with the string thing. Bugs
everywhere, man.
everywhere, man.
Yeah.
Um, for that I think what you can do,
Um, for that I think what you can do,
um, I guess this is another question. Do
um, I guess this is another question. Do
you only use um like for auto? From what
you only use um like for auto? From what
I'm seeing, all it is is like you use
I'm seeing, all it is is like you use
auto for a numeric variable that has uh
auto for a numeric variable that has uh
kind of like a default dynamic default
kind of like a default dynamic default
value pretty much. Yeah.
value pretty much. Yeah.
So to fix that, I think what you just do
So to fix that, I think what you just do
is you make it so that
is you make it so that
um basically
um basically
um like in the uh puffer RL um when you
um like in the uh puffer RL um when you
have the um add
have the um add
argument
argument
argument. Yeah. when you do the the
argument. Yeah. when you do the the
config loading and you
config loading and you
dynamically add arguments here with the
dynamically add arguments here with the
dynamic help menu from config. Um what
dynamic help menu from config. Um what
you can do is you can just do a very
you can do is you can just do a very
simple like if statement for
simple like if statement for
uh like the type do like a you know if
uh like the type do like a you know if
auto oh yeah you're right type is int or
auto oh yeah you're right type is int or
something like that you
something like that you
know do you think that would be a good
know do you think that would be a good
fix except I think there's int and float
fix except I think there's int and float
but yeah maybe I mean we can make it
but yeah maybe I mean we can make it
float and the intulations Python you
float and the intulations Python you
know doesn't really care except when it
know doesn't really care except when it
does
does
Yo, Spencer, why is it like it very
Yo, Spencer, why is it like it very
quickly figures out like a few of these?
quickly figures out like a few of these?
I'm looking at it and like it very
I'm looking at it and like it very
quickly starts some of these islands and
quickly starts some of these islands and
then it just
then it just
like kind of like pitters out. I don't
know.
know.
Um, are we confident that the total sum
Um, are we confident that the total sum
of
of
dirt is the same total sum on the other
dirt is the same total sum on the other
end?
end?
Well, no, but there's plenty of dirt to
Well, no, but there's plenty of dirt to
go around.
go around.
Like you can see all these all these
Like you can see all these all these
islands like poking
through. Well, it's a little hard for me
through. Well, it's a little hard for me
to tell which islands
are like I know there's new islands and
are like I know there's new islands and
I guess there's I guess it just reset a
I guess there's I guess it just reset a
second ago. So everything currently is
second ago. So everything currently is
supposed to be is old now, right? It
supposed to be is old now, right? It
just should be murdering all of these
just should be murdering all of these
islands.
like it fills in this one
like it fills in this one
here. Here, let me switch to the Twitch
here. Here, let me switch to the Twitch
stream so I can see your cursor flying
stream so I can see your cursor flying
around.
Okay. Why would this not being able to
see? It either can't see it or thinks
see? It either can't see it or thinks
it's not going to get reward from it or
it's not going to get reward from it or
it's easier to get something else.
kind of want to like look at
kind of want to like look at
this on the
um let's see terraform fast.
I want to be able to look at
this. All right. So like
this. All right. So like
here, this means
here, this means
that there's overlap between this
that there's overlap between this
formation and the goal. So
formation and the goal. So
like these two should be very close
like these two should be very close
together.
I think light green is like these must
I think light green is like these must
be like near flat, right? It's like
be like near flat, right? It's like
nearly matches the target, I
believe. What if all those things are
believe. What if all those things are
still overlapping with the existing
still overlapping with the existing
target?
target?
like and if it if it pulls it away from
like and if it if it pulls it away from
that mountain, it's actually losing.
that mountain, it's actually losing.
It's it's getting penalized because it's
It's it's getting penalized because it's
already overlap, right?
already overlap, right?
Well, when you zoom in, it kind of looks
Well, when you zoom in, it kind of looks
like they are.
like they are.
It does. I don't know
why. It just looks like there's more of
why. It just looks like there's more of
them, but it's still all on the same
them, but it's still all on the same
one.
one.
I've like summed it or something
weird. Cal everything.
You copy
You copy
the You copy a rig
map. How's this
work? Wait, where does the rig map get
work? Wait, where does the rig map get
copied?
copied?
Huh? in pearland noise
Huh? in pearland noise
wouldn't make
impl noiseise it's past the pointer and
impl noiseise it's past the pointer and
it's actively doing things to it where
it's actively doing things to it where
in pearl and noise it's not
where is it past where is it past. Oh,
where is it past where is it past. Oh,
cuz Yeah, you just you fill in the
cuz Yeah, you just you fill in the
original map and then you copy the
original map and then you copy the
original to the to just map.
original to the to just map.
Yeah, that's fine.
Wait, but how is map regular map used?
Wait, but how is map regular map used?
Like just map
Like just map
right here. So in reset you copy a rig
right here. So in reset you copy a rig
map into map.
Okay. Maybe we need to like
Welcome real learner. We are uh we have
Welcome real learner. We are uh we have
a terraforming environment that we are
a terraforming environment that we are
trying to figure
trying to figure
out what is wrong with. The goal is to
out what is wrong with. The goal is to
have a bunch of bulldozers turn one map
have a bunch of bulldozers turn one map
into another with
RL. What could be the issue?
RL. What could be the issue?
We also did uh
We also did uh
where's the other thing that we did
where's the other thing that we did
earlier today? We're good.
Or I don't know what you called it. We
Or I don't know what you called it. We
also made this earlier today, which is
also made this earlier today, which is
pretty freaking
awesome. And been some branch

today. Um, so I have a quick hack
today. Um, so I have a quick hack
Spencer that we can do.
are just going to copy over and change
are just going to copy over and change

to just place it up by 10.
Rio puffer ocean.
Yes. Be there.
Are you checking your fork or something?
Are you checking your fork or something?
If he's on his own fork, it's probably
If he's on his own fork, it's probably
that
that
right here. Well, I don't know. We We've
right here. Well, I don't know. We We've
pushed it quite often to to there for
I'm not holding out on
you. Something seems screw with
you. Something seems screw with
this that like
We just like displace this up way
more.
Oh, I think it's just misleading
Oh, I think it's just misleading
rendering.
rendering.
Spencer cuz
like Okay. So, like look at this.
There's
There's
a Maybe instead of having them overlaid,
a Maybe instead of having them overlaid,
we should have them entirely two two
we should have them entirely two two
separate maps side by side.
I'm trying to figure out why this
I'm trying to figure out why this
translation
is. Isn't this translated up
is. Isn't this translated up
completely? This is not translating it
completely? This is not translating it
upward the way I would
expect. Oh, you know why? I see.
This will do
This will do
it. That'll
it. That'll
seg. Actually, that'll just f
There we go. So, this shifts it up. You
see? So, this shifts this map
upwards. And we actually can tell that
upwards. And we actually can tell that
it's like it's very hard to see geometry
it's like it's very hard to see geometry
at all on this thing.
at all on this thing.
Yeah, I can't see
[ __ ] Let's like with these separate.
[ __ ] Let's like with these separate.
Let's make this actually
Okay. So, now it's starting to come
Okay. So, now it's starting to come
back, but it's still
iffy.
iffy.
Oh, the
fragment. Can I do
fragment. Can I do
it? Yeah. Okay, there we
it? Yeah. Okay, there we
go. So, now we can see both, right?
See?
See?
Yeah, I think we're okay with that
Yeah, I think we're okay with that
now. And we can change the displacement
now. And we can change the displacement
to be
to be
like something that's like closer.
So it's
So it's
like maybe
this. So definitely is the case then
this. So definitely is the case then
that it wasn't filling the stuff in,
that it wasn't filling the stuff in,
right?
right?
Yeah, for sure. It was filling. It was
Yeah, for sure. It was filling. It was
honestly just doing the same thing. I
honestly just doing the same thing. I
think
think
the parallax effect on this is really
the parallax effect on this is really
freaking cool.
freaking cool.
They're different
heights. I mean, I have all sorts of
heights. I mean, I have all sorts of
things I can do on the viz side. The
things I can do on the viz side. The
question is
question is
why why is it not filling in?
You want to do a Okay. So, now that this
You want to do a Okay. So, now that this
is fixed on this, rebuild and show the
is fixed on this, rebuild and show the
eval again.
I mean, it's eating this bad stuff,
I mean, it's eating this bad stuff,
right? Okay. Now, it seems correct. It's
right? Okay. Now, it seems correct. It's
eating away and it should be nothing
eating away and it should be nothing
thereafter.
It's actually It is eating it.
I mean, it looks substantially better at
I mean, it looks substantially better at
least from this
viz. I mean, it's murdering that one
viz. I mean, it's murdering that one
area. It's taking a while, but
but like there's nothing here at all.
Yeah, that has been ignored. The entire
Yeah, that has been ignored. The entire
bottom or middle left has been ignored.
Can we get a Let's find some guys trying
Can we get a Let's find some guys trying
to do autonomous
to do autonomous
uh autonomous snowshaping for like ski
uh autonomous snowshaping for like ski
lodges.
Okay. Yeah. Have it build a halfpipe.
I talked to the friend uh who owns a

It's still making the tower

it's like
it's like

and places it. It should get a reward
and places it. It should get a reward
for both because it's just deltas,
right? Yeah.
That's the only reward we're giving it.
That's the only reward we're giving it.
Yeah, think so.
I could push it and you could set up

Do you drive like 30 minutes just to go
Do you drive like 30 minutes just to go
to like an office?
Yeah, it's my my family's office. Oh,
Yeah, it's my my family's office. Oh,
dang. They're far.
dang. They're far.
Uh, not in terms of like Texas driving
Uh, not in terms of like Texas driving

20 30 minute drives are like nothing.
20 30 minute drives are like nothing.
Dude, it's too just too hard to go like
Dude, it's too just too hard to go like
out to a separate building to like go to
out to a separate building to like go to
my gym so it's like in the same room.
Straight up.
I mean that's fair. I need to go back to
I mean that's fair. I need to go back to
the gym.

Yeah, I need then I have to go to a gym.
Yeah, I need then I have to go to a gym.
Gym is good.

It is. But I mean, if you can't really
It is. But I mean, if you can't really
go to a gym, you can also do a lot of
go to a gym, you can also do a lot of
really good body weight stuff. So much
really good body weight stuff. So much
better. I feel like gym gym is superior.
better. I feel like gym gym is superior.
I mean, depends on what your definition
I mean, depends on what your definition
of superior is. Well, I it's superior in
of superior is. Well, I it's superior in
the sense that every mo every morning I
the sense that every mo every morning I
get up, I put the coffee pot on, and uh

I deadlift the bar behind me just once.
I deadlift the bar behind me just once.
Yeah. Just to wake up. But that's But

that's because you live in a gym. Like
that's because you live in a gym. Like

very good.
I mean, you to be fair, you you just you
I mean, you to be fair, you you just you
kind of just need like a barbell and
kind of just need like a barbell and
some plates. Mhm. That's generally
some plates. Mhm. That's generally
pretty. And dumbbells cuz how are you

going to do like lateral raises? Yeah.
going to do like lateral raises? Yeah.
Do you just lateral raise the bar?
Do you just lateral raise the bar?
Lateral raise. Yeah, it's a bar.
Um, okay. I think what would be
Um, okay. I think what would be
something that would be screwing with

I'm going to push this though so that
I'm going to push this though so that
you can do sweeps.
you can do sweeps.
Yeah, just go ahead and push it. I'll

let me just get some sweeps going and

You can say like to pass it like that,

Now we have target

You're getting

So
weird.
Oh. Okay, there we go. There's your
Oh. Okay, there we go. There's your
static. Like just fighting my own
debugging. There we go.
Okay, way better.
Delta.
There we go. There's our
delta. We can
uh now
accentuated a little bit. Yeah. So,
accentuated a little bit. Yeah. So,
there's our delta. Like these are the
there's our delta. Like these are the
regions that need
help. Green. Okay. is way more
help. Green. Okay. is way more
visible. But I think we're going to do.
Oh
man, all hunt.
Cool. So now we have like this
Cool. So now we have like this
transparent fog thing going on.
848. Grind on this a little bit more.
848. Grind on this a little bit more.
Trying to think how I want this to look.
Now we can
Now we can
see all the spots where this pokes
through. If we can get this to like
through. If we can get this to like
actually render reasonably next
This actually this almost does it
There. Let's just see if it's a color
There. Let's just see if it's a color
problem. Oh, yeah. That's way more
problem. Oh, yeah. That's way more
freaking visible.
Can't freaking see this is the problem
Can't freaking see this is the problem
at
Go back to this for a second.
Okay, that's something
right now. You can clearly see the parts
right now. You can clearly see the parts
that are like very heavily off.
Maybe it should be the other way here,
Maybe it should be the other way here,
right?
Five.5 is kind of like
weak better. Now what the the question
weak better. Now what the the question
is, can I get away with doing this to
is, can I get away with doing this to
the other fragment shader so you can
the other fragment shader so you can
kind of see them
kind of see them
together, right?
heck not work.
Uh, it's definitely changing it, but
Uh, it's definitely changing it, but
like you can't freaking see anything
like you can't freaking see anything
under
it. How's that make any
sense? Oh, yeah. There's something wrong

with this
with this
because this just cuts it out of the
because this just cuts it out of the
map.
seems absolute value target height minus

This should not be this way, right?
This should not be this way, right?
Like, how does this make any
sense? Is abs. No, abs is a function,

right?
because of this
black. Oh, right. This just gives
you Why does this get cut out entirely?
you Why does this get cut out entirely?
Is it render
all the regions where you can see the

transparent. Can't see anything behind
transparent. Can't see anything behind
it.
I mean, I could potentially make this
I mean, I could potentially make this
thing I could make this thing a shader

on this
technically just like raise this bloody
technically just like raise this bloody
thing up. Can't I
Okay. So, the fact here is
Okay. So, the fact here is
that there actually isn't
that there actually isn't
uh there is not a shader portion
uh there is not a shader portion

way better. So now you can see frame

Good.
Okay. So now you get both of these. Um
Okay. So now you get both of these. Um
but you don't get to know what is low
but you don't get to know what is low
and what is high which and that is
bad. Start color and
bad. Start color and

This is divide by. So you got to do

There you go. So
now this says this is to

You can't do it here, dummy.

Yeah, this made it jank, didn't it?

to do the all right offset.
Okay, that's about what we were looking
Okay, that's about what we were looking
for here. So now we actually have like

some terrain and there's actually some

You can do lots of stuff in I just want

This is right on top of this, right?
There you go. That's actually easier to

And then this is going to be like this

this? Why does this max do weird things?
I literally just have to reach over and
I literally just have to reach over and
turn the knob for ISO. It's
easy. Okay. So, for this thing here,
easy. Okay. So, for this thing here,
like this is
like this is
actually this is clean
actually this is clean

gives you the contours.
that gives you like these perfect
that gives you like these perfect

I think one is that
like probably just go like this.
Wait here.
Maybe. Give me this.
Okay, there. So now there's a minimum.
Okay, there. So now there's a minimum.
So if there's any difference at all, you
So if there's any difference at all, you

Now, this is getting pretty

And I go to freaking dead.
It kind of still aliases with the

We can get first person
We can get first person

Yeah, there's the

Yes. Make you do this real quick.

the player controls in the C. Yeah. But
um I think specifically for
this want to do like

Uh, I guess I need to

Oh, you know what? I bet you they can't
Oh, you know what? I bet you they can't
see the delta very
see the delta very
well. I think I figured out why they're
well. I think I figured out why they're
stacking too
high. So,
high. So,
like it's target map.
minus
map. So if target map is lower, this
map. So if target map is lower, this
becomes a negative number and then this
becomes a negative number and then this
gets put into a
char. So you think it's being
char. So you think it's being
constrained too much?
I think it should be like
I think it should be like
120 or 128. It should be like
one something like
one something like
this. We'll try before and after with
this. You see, I think it was not I
this. You see, I think it was not I
think it was missing half the delta.
Uh hello. Hey, how's it going?

Good. Um so I was able to find the bug
Good. Um so I was able to find the bug
and why that is happening with like the

it seems to be like a bigger issue than

having specifically with the weird you
get what I'm saying? Huh?
get what I'm saying? Huh?
That's weird because you're you're
That's weird because you're you're
parsing it. So when you have the default
parsing it. So when you have the default

the type in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
That's super obnoxious.
That's super obnoxious.
Mhm. I will I don't know what to do

Well, we didn't fix the ops yet either.

Yeah, because the bet also had that

Okay, we're going to do this again. Uh
Okay, we're going to do this again. Uh
and now hopefully So can you explain the

your obs change? I don't understand like
your obs change? I don't understand like
how that would have made a difference.
how that would have made a difference.
I did like target minus uh source
I did like target minus uh source
uh and then I I scale it from 0 to 255
uh and then I I scale it from 0 to 255
and then it gets assigned to an unsigned

Okay. So if it's negative then it just
Okay. So if it's negative then it just
gets cropped to zero or possibly
gets cropped to zero or possibly
undefined behavior.
because char can only be 0 to
285. So, how did you go about fixing
285. So, how did you go about fixing
that? Did you subtract it by 128 to
that? Did you subtract it by 128 to
start?
start?
Yeah, kind of. Um, now to be fair,
Yeah, kind of. Um, now to be fair,
technically we could just
technically we could just
go we could do a sign char instead of a
go we could do a sign char instead of a
unsigned char, which is int 8. That
unsigned char, which is int 8. That
might be the better
effect. We'll see if it does any
effect. We'll see if it does any
better. Should make them stop
better. Should make them stop
overstacking.
at a low level. Is that what casting
at a low level. Is that what casting
from float to char does automatically
from float to char does automatically
like the cast function?
like the cast function?
Well, it's got to produce a valid char,

right? It just divi it just divides it

It just it it'll round by default.
I actually manually scale it to get it
I actually manually scale it to get it

So what we can do

So what you can do
So what you can do
is I'm interested to know how much you
is I'm interested to know how much you
are using auto.

Um let me search. So let's
do okay. So using it
here. Auto. No no like this. Yeah.

So, yeah.
So, no idea from what I see.
See if that scale.
See if that scale.
The average batch of data is now only

coming from one
environment and 32 32 agents.
What?
What?
When you see n equals 32, there 32
When you see n equals 32, there 32
agents in one end. It means that that
agents in one end. It means that that
log is just like one ep one environment
log is just like one ep one environment
episode worth of data.
No, they get average. So it should be 32
No, they get average. So it should be 32
32 agents.
N doesn't get averaged.
Uh and GPU drive it's the same thing
Uh and GPU drive it's the same thing
too. But I set up 1024 agents. N is

getting all the logs at the same time.
But so look at this. But you're saying
But so look at this. But you're saying
it should be a multiple. Oh, that looks
it should be a multiple. Oh, that looks
better. That looks better.
I'm think I'm seeing less stacking.
I'm think I'm seeing less stacking.
There shouldn't be any now.
There shouldn't be any now.
I don't see anything.
I don't see anything.
I'm questioning middle right a little
I'm questioning middle right a little
bit
bit
maybe, but it might just be filling it
maybe, but it might just be filling it
in and that is the high point that's
in and that is the high point that's
necessary.
Why they don't fill in these like other
Why they don't fill in these like other
islands down at the bottom?
islands down at the bottom?
You think they're just too far? Could
You think they're just too far? Could
be. Like it just doesn't see it and it's
be. Like it just doesn't see it and it's
like screw down here. This and that.
like screw down here. This and that.
There's easier reward otherwise
maybe now. They should be filling stuff
maybe now. They should be filling stuff
in. It feels like they've kind of slowed
down. There a bunch of them
stuck. They get unstuck though
stuck. They get unstuck though
automatically anyways. Maybe that's it.

Maybe they just keep going to like try
Maybe they just keep going to like try
to put the stuff in and they get

that. They're building tower of babel.

you know, one concept I was thinking of

if we ranked areas to start targets in
I I actually don't understand why

there's like nothing on like this

Yeah. I don't know why that it could be
Yeah. I don't know why that it could be

there's quite possibly
there's quite possibly

like this whole island like they're
like this whole island like they're

green because it's getting shallower and

then they just ignore this one. And
then they just ignore this one. And
they're still making tower babble over
they're still making tower babble over

here. This one for some reason. I wonder
if there's a reason that they're doing

um, I guess this is another question. Do
um, I guess this is another question. Do
you only use um like for auto? From what
you only use um like for auto? From what
I'm seeing, all it is is like you use
I'm seeing, all it is is like you use
auto for a numeric variable that has uh
auto for a numeric variable that has uh
kind of like a default dynamic default
kind of like a default dynamic default
value pretty much. Yeah.
value pretty much. Yeah.
So to fix that, I think what you just do
So to fix that, I think what you just do
is you make it so that
is you make it so that
um basically
um basically
um like in the uh puffer RL um when you
um like in the uh puffer RL um when you
have the um add
have the um add
argument
argument
argument. Yeah. when you do the the
argument. Yeah. when you do the the
config loading and you
config loading and you
dynamically add arguments here with the
dynamically add arguments here with the
dynamic help menu from config. Um what
dynamic help menu from config. Um what
you can do is you can just do a very
you can do is you can just do a very
simple like if statement for
simple like if statement for
uh like the type do like a you know if
uh like the type do like a you know if
auto oh yeah you're right type is int or
auto oh yeah you're right type is int or
something like that you
something like that you
know do you think that would be a good
know do you think that would be a good
fix except I think there's int and float
fix except I think there's int and float
but yeah maybe I mean we can make it
but yeah maybe I mean we can make it
float and the intulations Python you
float and the intulations Python you
know doesn't really care except when it

does

Yo, Spencer, why is it like it very
Yo, Spencer, why is it like it very
quickly figures out like a few of these?
quickly figures out like a few of these?
I'm looking at it and like it very
I'm looking at it and like it very
quickly starts some of these islands and
quickly starts some of these islands and
then it just
then it just
like kind of like pitters out. I don't
know.
know.
Um, are we confident that the total sum
Um, are we confident that the total sum
of
of
dirt is the same total sum on the other
dirt is the same total sum on the other
end?
end?
Well, no, but there's plenty of dirt to
Well, no, but there's plenty of dirt to
go around.
go around.
Like you can see all these all these
Like you can see all these all these
islands like poking
through. Well, it's a little hard for me
through. Well, it's a little hard for me
to tell which islands
are like I know there's new islands and
are like I know there's new islands and
I guess there's I guess it just reset a
I guess there's I guess it just reset a
second ago. So everything currently is
second ago. So everything currently is
supposed to be is old now, right? It
supposed to be is old now, right? It
just should be murdering all of these
just should be murdering all of these
islands.
like it fills in this one
like it fills in this one
here. Here, let me switch to the Twitch
here. Here, let me switch to the Twitch
stream so I can see your cursor flying
stream so I can see your cursor flying
around.
Okay. Why would this not being able to
see? It either can't see it or thinks
see? It either can't see it or thinks
it's not going to get reward from it or
it's not going to get reward from it or
it's easier to get something else.
kind of want to like look at
kind of want to like look at
this on the
um let's see terraform fast.
I want to be able to look at
this. All right. So like
this. All right. So like
here, this means
here, this means
that there's overlap between this
that there's overlap between this
formation and the goal. So
formation and the goal. So
like these two should be very close
like these two should be very close
together.
I think light green is like these must
I think light green is like these must
be like near flat, right? It's like
be like near flat, right? It's like
nearly matches the target, I
believe. What if all those things are
believe. What if all those things are
still overlapping with the existing
still overlapping with the existing
target?
target?
like and if it if it pulls it away from
like and if it if it pulls it away from
that mountain, it's actually losing.
that mountain, it's actually losing.
It's it's getting penalized because it's
It's it's getting penalized because it's
already overlap, right?
already overlap, right?
Well, when you zoom in, it kind of looks
Well, when you zoom in, it kind of looks
like they are.
like they are.
It does. I don't know
why. It just looks like there's more of
why. It just looks like there's more of
them, but it's still all on the same
them, but it's still all on the same
one.
one.
I've like summed it or something
weird. Cal everything.
You copy
You copy
the You copy a rig
map. How's this
work? Wait, where does the rig map get
work? Wait, where does the rig map get
copied?
copied?
Huh? in pearland noise
Huh? in pearland noise
wouldn't make
impl noiseise it's past the pointer and
impl noiseise it's past the pointer and
it's actively doing things to it where
it's actively doing things to it where
in pearl and noise it's not
where is it past where is it past. Oh,
where is it past where is it past. Oh,
cuz Yeah, you just you fill in the
cuz Yeah, you just you fill in the
original map and then you copy the
original map and then you copy the
original to the to just map.
original to the to just map.
Yeah, that's fine.
Wait, but how is map regular map used?
Wait, but how is map regular map used?
Like just map
Like just map
right here. So in reset you copy a rig
right here. So in reset you copy a rig
map into map.
Okay. Maybe we need to like
Welcome real learner. We are uh we have
Welcome real learner. We are uh we have
a terraforming environment that we are
a terraforming environment that we are
trying to figure
trying to figure
out what is wrong with. The goal is to
out what is wrong with. The goal is to
have a bunch of bulldozers turn one map
have a bunch of bulldozers turn one map
into another with
RL. What could be the issue?
RL. What could be the issue?
We also did uh
We also did uh
where's the other thing that we did
where's the other thing that we did
earlier today? We're good.
Or I don't know what you called it. We
Or I don't know what you called it. We
also made this earlier today, which is
also made this earlier today, which is
pretty freaking
awesome. And been some branch

Spencer that we can do.
are just going to copy over and change

to just place it up by 10.
Rio puffer ocean.
Yes. Be there.
Are you checking your fork or something?
Are you checking your fork or something?
If he's on his own fork, it's probably
If he's on his own fork, it's probably
that
that
right here. Well, I don't know. We We've
right here. Well, I don't know. We We've
pushed it quite often to to there for
I'm not holding out on
you. Something seems screw with
you. Something seems screw with
this that like
We just like displace this up way
more.
Oh, I think it's just misleading
Oh, I think it's just misleading
rendering.
rendering.
Spencer cuz
like Okay. So, like look at this.
There's
There's
a Maybe instead of having them overlaid,
a Maybe instead of having them overlaid,
we should have them entirely two two
we should have them entirely two two
separate maps side by side.
I'm trying to figure out why this
I'm trying to figure out why this
translation
is. Isn't this translated up
is. Isn't this translated up
completely? This is not translating it
completely? This is not translating it
upward the way I would
expect. Oh, you know why? I see.
This will do
This will do
it. That'll
it. That'll
seg. Actually, that'll just f
There we go. So, this shifts it up. You
see? So, this shifts this map
upwards. And we actually can tell that
upwards. And we actually can tell that
it's like it's very hard to see geometry
it's like it's very hard to see geometry
at all on this thing.
at all on this thing.
Yeah, I can't see
[ __ ] Let's like with these separate.
[ __ ] Let's like with these separate.
Let's make this actually
Okay. So, now it's starting to come
Okay. So, now it's starting to come
back, but it's still
iffy.
iffy.
Oh, the
fragment. Can I do
fragment. Can I do
it? Yeah. Okay, there we
it? Yeah. Okay, there we
go. So, now we can see both, right?
See?
See?
Yeah, I think we're okay with that
Yeah, I think we're okay with that
now. And we can change the displacement
now. And we can change the displacement
to be
to be
like something that's like closer.
So it's
So it's
like maybe
this. So definitely is the case then
this. So definitely is the case then
that it wasn't filling the stuff in,
that it wasn't filling the stuff in,
right?
right?
Yeah, for sure. It was filling. It was
Yeah, for sure. It was filling. It was
honestly just doing the same thing. I
honestly just doing the same thing. I
think
think
the parallax effect on this is really
the parallax effect on this is really
freaking cool.
freaking cool.
They're different
heights. I mean, I have all sorts of
heights. I mean, I have all sorts of
things I can do on the viz side. The
things I can do on the viz side. The
question is
question is
why why is it not filling in?
You want to do a Okay. So, now that this
You want to do a Okay. So, now that this
is fixed on this, rebuild and show the
is fixed on this, rebuild and show the
eval again.
I mean, it's eating this bad stuff,
I mean, it's eating this bad stuff,
right? Okay. Now, it seems correct. It's
right? Okay. Now, it seems correct. It's
eating away and it should be nothing
eating away and it should be nothing
thereafter.
It's actually It is eating it.
I mean, it looks substantially better at
I mean, it looks substantially better at
least from this
viz. I mean, it's murdering that one
viz. I mean, it's murdering that one
area. It's taking a while, but
but like there's nothing here at all.
Yeah, that has been ignored. The entire
Yeah, that has been ignored. The entire
bottom or middle left has been ignored.
Can we get a Let's find some guys trying
Can we get a Let's find some guys trying
to do autonomous
to do autonomous
uh autonomous snowshaping for like ski
uh autonomous snowshaping for like ski
lodges.
Okay. Yeah. Have it build a halfpipe.
I talked to the friend uh who owns a
I talked to the friend uh who owns a
ranch. He said they they would want to
ranch. He said they they would want to
be doing it for some like taking out a
be doing it for some like taking out a
brush with dozers for ranch maintenance.
It's still making the tower
available. Yeah, there it is. At least
available. Yeah, there it is. At least
it's like
it's like
better. Like look at this.
Okay. So, it still gets it it will get a
Okay. So, it still gets it it will get a
reward simultaneously
reward simultaneously
for when it pulls from an existing area
for when it pulls from an existing area
and places it. It should get a reward
and places it. It should get a reward
for both because it's just deltas,
right? Yeah.
That's the only reward we're giving it.
That's the only reward we're giving it.
Yeah, think so.
I could push it and you could set up
I could push it and you could set up
some sweets.
some sweets.
I think you got to go to dinner.
I think you got to go to dinner.
I do.
I do.
Um, not quite. Yeah, but pretty
Um, not quite. Yeah, but pretty
close. I still got to drive like 30
close. I still got to drive like 30
minutes back to my house.
I mean, it could be a Pam's thing. I
I mean, it could be a Pam's thing. I
mean, possibly.
mean, possibly.
Do you drive like 30 minutes just to go
Do you drive like 30 minutes just to go
to like an office?
Yeah, it's my my family's office. Oh,
Yeah, it's my my family's office. Oh,
dang. They're far.
dang. They're far.
Uh, not in terms of like Texas driving
Uh, not in terms of like Texas driving
times. That's like very like chill. Like

20 30 minute drives are like nothing.
20 30 minute drives are like nothing.
Dude, it's too just too hard to go like
Dude, it's too just too hard to go like
out to a separate building to like go to
out to a separate building to like go to
my gym so it's like in the same room.
Straight up.
I mean that's fair. I need to go back to
I mean that's fair. I need to go back to
the gym.
the gym.
Yeah, I need then I have to go to a gym.
Yeah, I need then I have to go to a gym.
Gym is good.
Gym is good.
It is. But I mean, if you can't really
It is. But I mean, if you can't really
go to a gym, you can also do a lot of
go to a gym, you can also do a lot of
really good body weight stuff. So much
really good body weight stuff. So much
better. I feel like gym gym is superior.
better. I feel like gym gym is superior.
I mean, depends on what your definition
I mean, depends on what your definition
of superior is. Well, I it's superior in
of superior is. Well, I it's superior in
the sense that every mo every morning I
the sense that every mo every morning I
get up, I put the coffee pot on, and uh
get up, I put the coffee pot on, and uh
I deadlift the bar behind me just once.
I deadlift the bar behind me just once.
Yeah. Just to wake up. But that's But
Yeah. Just to wake up. But that's But
that's because you live in a gym. Like
that's because you live in a gym. Like
most people, you know, have to travel
most people, you know, have to travel
there. Like and that's like if if the

very good.
very good.
I mean, you to be fair, you you just you
I mean, you to be fair, you you just you
kind of just need like a barbell and
kind of just need like a barbell and
some plates. Mhm. That's generally
some plates. Mhm. That's generally
pretty. And dumbbells cuz how are you
pretty. And dumbbells cuz how are you
going to do like lateral raises? Yeah.
going to do like lateral raises? Yeah.
Do you just lateral raise the bar?
Do you just lateral raise the bar?
Lateral raise. Yeah, it's a bar.
Um, okay. I think what would be
Um, okay. I think what would be
something that would be screwing with
something that would be screwing with
this?
this?
Um, I I feel like the obs are pretty
Um, I I feel like the obs are pretty
chill. I
mean, maybe the compressing thing is

still wrong. Could
still wrong. Could
be. I think when you go to dinner, I'm
be. I think when you go to dinner, I'm
going to spend hourish on this and I'm
going to spend hourish on this and I'm
going to try to
going to try to
uh I'm gonna try to make like a really
uh I'm gonna try to make like a really
nice shader that'll like tell us.
nice shader that'll like tell us.
I'm going to push this though so that
I'm going to push this though so that
you can do sweeps.
you can do sweeps.
Yeah, just go ahead and push it. I'll
Yeah, just go ahead and push it. I'll
let me just get some sweeps going and
let me just get some sweeps going and
I'll get like some parameters picked and
I'll get like some parameters picked and
such. Okay. A quick question. Um the so
such. Okay. A quick question. Um the so
you know how you have like the sweep
you know how you have like the sweep
something
something
um that is not like an argument that you
um that is not like an argument that you
can pass right? What like sweep like the
can pass right? What like sweep like the
sweep.vac.nums and then like there's a
sweep.vac.nums and then like there's a
scale argument there. That thing you
scale argument there. That thing you
can't pass through like the command
can't pass through like the command
line. Oh, you technically can. I don't
line. Oh, you technically can. I don't
know why you'd want to, but you can.
know why you'd want to, but you can.
Yeah. So it's not like really useful.
Yeah. So it's not like really useful.
You can say like to pass it like that,
You can say like to pass it like that,
right?
right?
I mean you can do it. Yes. Um so what's
I mean you can do it. Yes. Um so what's
scale? Is scale a float?
scale? Is scale a float?
Uh yeah.
Uh yeah.
Yeah. So from what I see scale is the
Yeah. So from what I see scale is the
only like auto float like um um
only like auto float like um um
something that you use auto for that is
something that you use auto for that is
float. Everything else looks to be like

an like bat size like

um num workers from what I see you use
um num workers from what I see you use
batch size numbum workers and that's
batch size numbum workers and that's
about it for
okay that's that is pushed I also had
okay that's that is pushed I also had
forgotten to push the puffer image so
forgotten to push the puffer image so
now you have the puffer image pushed
so anybody who wants to build some m you
so anybody who wants to build some m you
have the puffer er assets now. Yeah.
have the puffer er assets now. Yeah.
Did you just do that right now? I just
Did you just do that right now? I just
pulled the second I forgot to I'd

So, uh, Joseph, would you like me to
So, uh, Joseph, would you like me to
like PR real quick? Like, uh, create a

how annoying it is to do uh to
how annoying it is to do uh to
send map data to shaders.
Okay. Yeah, that's
Ah, it's like super annoying to do this,
Ah, it's like super annoying to do this,
but it's fine. Figure it out.
Wait a
second. Quick question. Um, so from what
second. Quick question. Um, so from what
I see here,
I see here,
um, most of the auto, um, well, all of
um, most of the auto, um, well, all of
them, all of the auto, um, like
them, all of the auto, um, like

it valid for scale to be a negative? No,
it valid for scale to be a negative? No,
not at the moment. But that's going to
not at the moment. But that's going to
be a really shitty bug to catch if we
be a really shitty bug to catch if we
like round or do something dumb. Well,
like round or do something dumb. Well,
what I was thinking is more just like
what I was thinking is more just like
instead of auto do like a negative one
instead of auto do like a negative one
and then that, you know. Yeah, but
and then that, you know. Yeah, but
that's really confusing to see in a

Now we have target

You're getting

So
weird.
Oh. Okay, there we go. There's your
Oh. Okay, there we go. There's your
static. Like just fighting my own
debugging. There we go.
Okay, way better.
Delta.
There we go. There's our
delta. We can
uh now
accentuated a little bit. Yeah. So,
accentuated a little bit. Yeah. So,
there's our delta. Like these are the
there's our delta. Like these are the
regions that need
help. Green. Okay. is way more
help. Green. Okay. is way more
visible. But I think we're going to do.
Oh
man, all hunt.
Cool. So now we have like this
Cool. So now we have like this
transparent fog thing going on.
848. Grind on this a little bit more.
848. Grind on this a little bit more.
Trying to think how I want this to look.
Now we can
Now we can
see all the spots where this pokes
through. If we can get this to like
through. If we can get this to like
actually render reasonably next
This actually this almost does it
There. Let's just see if it's a color
There. Let's just see if it's a color
problem. Oh, yeah. That's way more

freaking visible.
Can't freaking see this is the problem
Can't freaking see this is the problem
at
Go back to this for a second.
Okay, that's something
right now. You can clearly see the parts
right now. You can clearly see the parts
that are like very heavily off.
Maybe it should be the other way here,
Maybe it should be the other way here,
right?
Five.5 is kind of like
weak better. Now what the the question
weak better. Now what the the question
is, can I get away with doing this to
is, can I get away with doing this to
the other fragment shader so you can
the other fragment shader so you can
kind of see them
kind of see them
together, right?
heck not work.
Uh, it's definitely changing it, but
Uh, it's definitely changing it, but
like you can't freaking see anything
like you can't freaking see anything
under
it. How's that make any
sense? Oh, yeah. There's something wrong

with this
with this
because this just cuts it out of the
because this just cuts it out of the

seems absolute value target height minus

This should not be this way, right?
This should not be this way, right?
Like, how does this make any
sense? Is abs. No, abs is a function,

right?
because of this
black. Oh, right. This just gives
you Why does this get cut out entirely?
you Why does this get cut out entirely?
Is it render
all the regions where you can see the

transparent. Can't see anything behind

it.
I mean, I could potentially make this

technically just like raise this bloody
technically just like raise this bloody

Okay. So, the fact here is
Okay. So, the fact here is
that there actually isn't
that there actually isn't

Here is
Here is

way better. So now you can see frame

Good.
Okay. So now you get both of these. Um
Okay. So now you get both of these. Um
but you don't get to know what is low
but you don't get to know what is low
and what is high which and that is
bad. Start color and
bad. Start color and
color. Do a simple
color. Do a simple
uh
red
green. Hey bet.
This is divide by. So you got to do
This is divide by. So you got to do
0.5. Where is it? It's just this minus

There you go. So
now this says this is to

do possible to get right. You just have
to do the all right offset.
Okay, that's about what we were looking
Okay, that's about what we were looking
for here. So now we actually have like
for here. So now we actually have like
some terrain and there's actually some
some terrain and there's actually some

You can do lots of stuff in I just want

This is right on top of this, right?
There you go. That's actually easier to

right. I'm just trying to figure out a

It's too big.
uh other region other way around. So the

the actual red map is the current map.
And then this is going to be like this
And then this is going to be like this
