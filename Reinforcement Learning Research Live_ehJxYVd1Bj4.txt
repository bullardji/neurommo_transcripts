Good evening.
I am back. Why am I back at 7 p.m.?
I am back. Why am I back at 7 p.m.?
I'm back at 700 p.m. because robotics
I'm back at 700 p.m. because robotics
doesn't make any sense. So, we're going
doesn't make any sense. So, we're going
to see if I can help fix that.
Here were the current experiments. Um,
Here were the current experiments. Um,
what is the best way of doing this? See,
trying to think if we should just go to
trying to think if we should just go to
a harder problem.
You know, let me look at a couple
You know, let me look at a couple
things. Let me just look at a couple,
things. Let me just look at a couple,
right?
right?
We'll decide
like this thing. You can understand why
like this thing. You can understand why
it's a pain, right?
Where's like the push T thing?
Oh,
Oh,
this is Wait.
only get to push.
I see.
Is that hard?
That honestly seems worse.
Okay,
Okay,
look at their baselines.
We'll decide from there. Welcome, Twitch
We'll decide from there. Welcome, Twitch
folks.
Where did my chat go?
Where did my chat go?
back under the camera.
We're going to hope that the stream is
We're going to hope that the stream is
stable because uh I don't know what the
stable because uh I don't know what the
weather's doing outside. We've had like
weather's doing outside. We've had like
three different micro bursts in the last
three different micro bursts in the last
two hours.
Weather's kind of wonky around here.
There's this
Okay.
So
So
got pick cube,
got pick cube,
got push cube.
got push cube.
And see this one is slightly harder.
And see this one is slightly harder.
Yes.
And push t
And push t
much much longer.
Jack cube
Jack cube
even harder.
even harder.
Then where is it? Peg insertion.
Even harder. Okay, I think
Why the heck would stack Q hard?
We'll start with push T.
That is like a concerning gale outside.
That is like a concerning gale outside.
Holy.
I hope I don't lose my roof. I've got a
I hope I don't lose my roof. I've got a
lot of nice hardware in here.
I'd like to keep my roof, please.
I think this is it, right? Push TB1.
All right.
All right.
So, the hypothesis here is that
So, the hypothesis here is that
hopefully
hopefully
our setup scales
our setup scales
to higher task complexity better than
to higher task complexity better than
theirs does, even though it's kind of
theirs does, even though it's kind of
difficult for us to like speedrun the
difficult for us to like speedrun the
super simple tasks.
super simple tasks.
That's the hope.
We shall see.
Why are we seeing all those successes at

the start?
Something is weird.

Definitely weird.

Yeah, our return graphs are not going to

Okay, we're starting to get like an

We're seeing it on return as well. Very
We're seeing it on return as well. Very

I really didn't mess with very much

Maybe this is the puffer robotics arc.
How long does it take them to solve this
How long does it take them to solve this

Wall clock.
Oh, they actually have it in like five
Oh, they actually have it in like five
minutes. Okay, not that bad then.
one looks like we could do it faster
one looks like we could do it faster
potentially. Oh, you know what?
potentially. Oh, you know what?
Actually, I I do see here that they have
Actually, I I do see here that they have
a bunch of like
a bunch of like
solve rates before it catches.
solve rates before it catches.
Okay, that's not bad.
So,
if this works, we can maybe do the uh
if this works, we can maybe do the uh
peg insertion task.
That cube has like a really stupid
That cube has like a really stupid
looking return curve.

That could just be the reward function
That could just be the reward function
to be fair.
At
least it's a good thing that we're
least it's a good thing that we're
actually like solving these tasks,
actually like solving these tasks,
right? Keep in mind, none of this stuff
right? Keep in mind, none of this stuff
was set up for robotics. We don't even
was set up for robotics. We don't even
have that many M's with continuous

The fact that we're kind of just like
The fact that we're kind of just like
doing robotics out of the box is already
doing robotics out of the box is already
pretty dang good.
It'll get better with optimization,
It'll get better with optimization,
right?
I could try to get 2048 to work locally
I could try to get 2048 to work locally
in the meantime
here.
It's actually we'll not do it on my
It's actually we'll not do it on my
local. We'll do it on uh on Puffer Max.
Okay. So, this is 2048. This will run
Okay. So, this is 2048. This will run
over here. And uh it looks like this is
over here. And uh it looks like this is
improving. Yes.
Yeah, we're getting somewhere.
That's once
probably. We do just have to tune
probably. We do just have to tune
everything.
everything.
So, I mean, here's an interesting
So, I mean, here's an interesting
question, right?
question, right?
How do we tune everything?
How do we tune everything?
when it has to be multiGPU like this.
Like I can't even run all the M's on one
Like I can't even run all the M's on one
GPU.
Be fair, we don't have to do this all at
Be fair, we don't have to do this all at
once, right? Technically, I can punt on
once, right? Technically, I can punt on
this and just like say we'll get some
this and just like say we'll get some
mostly policies to start with
and then we come back once we have
and then we come back once we have
multiGPU sweeps.
That's a fine approach.
That's a fine approach.
Also, it looks like 2048 is working now.
I think I set this to 40 mil. So, I
I think I set this to 40 mil. So, I
think we should be good for
think we should be good for
quite a bit.
What's the speed?
What's the speed?
O, slow. 140k. 150k.
Are they just like really sample
Are they just like really sample
efficient or something?
Yeah, they just solve this in 20 mil,
Yeah, they just solve this in 20 mil,
huh?
There's something wrong if they're
There's something wrong if they're
solving it in that many fewer steps,

Well,
we would expect what, naively? 120 mil.

So basically what I am facing you know
So basically what I am facing you know
so I I try sweep for pong you know to go

sweep is going to get you sweep is going
sweep is going to get you sweep is going
to run a whole bunch of experiments

and then the idea is that you go grab
and then the idea is that you go grab
the optimal hyperparameters
the optimal hyperparameters
from the p the specific experiment that
from the p the specific experiment that
you want, right?
you want, right?
Like if you just load random experiments
Like if you just load random experiments
from the sweep, they may or may not be

any good
because the sweep not every experiment
because the sweep not every experiment
in the sweep is going to work well.

That's the point of it, right? Is that
That's the point of it, right? Is that
it tries a whole bunch of different
it tries a whole bunch of different
things. If you just go like load some

random stuff from the beep may or may

not be good.
not be good.
But the one it you know reaches the

work. Yes. But then how did you go get

Uh I find the name locally and uh trying

not working.
And it shows as one. Does the show go as

like PF is one? Uh
can you repeat again what the experiment
can you repeat again what the experiment
that you load for the experiment that
that you load for the experiment that
you loaded uh in the sweep does it show
you loaded uh in the sweep does it show
as having performance one?
Let me stick because I didn't know that.
What's the um so I mean there there are
What's the um so I mean there there are
a few different metrics you can look at
a few different metrics you can look at
there, right? Like there's a there's a

to be different for every game or every

environments have a perf metric which we
environments have a perf metric which we
do to try to make your life easier. We

try to add a zero to one normalized uh
try to add a zero to one normalized uh
indicator of performance. You just know

that like one is good, zero is bad,
that like one is good, zero is bad,
right? We try to make it very easy in

that way. So for pong, one means you're
that way. So for pong, one means you're
getting all the points, right? And in in
getting all the points, right? And in in
the case of Pong, like the maximum score
the case of Pong, like the maximum score

Yeah. Let's say um
yeah 15 is is I know it's working
yeah 15 is is I know it's working
because it's uh it's using the CLA but
because it's uh it's using the CLA but
let's say um
let's say um
second one
second one
this is also good right
this is also good right
looks like it. Yeah. Yeah. If
looks like it. Yeah. Yeah. If
if I try. So I'm still, you know, using
if I try. So I'm still, you know, using
the sweep to test it out like the one
the sweep to test it out like the one
running now. I think Yeah. Is it
I think 16 also kind of a you know it's
I think 16 also kind of a you know it's
flattened out.
flattened out.
Well, it's Yeah, it's trained like
Well, it's Yeah, it's trained like
I can't tell exactly. It looks like
I can't tell exactly. It looks like

Mhm. Uh,
gray is 11 and blue is zero.
Oh. Um, okay.
Oh. Um, okay.
Is there a frame skip parameter
Is there a frame skip parameter
difference?

So when you ran sweep, part of the sweep
So when you ran sweep, part of the sweep
is the frame skip.
I didn't do any sort of uh Yeah, but
I didn't do any sort of uh Yeah, but
like like it'll do it for you. So if you
like like it'll do it for you. So if you
look at your config,
look at your config,
okay,
okay,
you look at the phone config.
You know where that is?
You know where that is?
Here 16. No, I'm well. Yes, you can look
Here 16. No, I'm well. Yes, you can look
at that first. Go to 16.
That'll work. And now look for frame
That'll work. And now look for frame

There you go. So, literally all that
There you go. So, literally all that
happened, all that happened here, right,

in puffer so you would not know this

So I I I'm actually pretty impressed

Oh, it's a yeah, I was pretty impressed

typically the whole the whole shtick is

that your data comes from a SIM and if
that your data comes from a SIM and if
you can build a fast SIM for something,

you can probably reinforcement learn it.
And then the like the question is

basically how high fidelity does your

that'll take me a while. Um, the thing
that'll take me a while. Um, the thing
I'm wondering, Arin, is
I'm wondering, Arin, is
has anybody tried to do like RL in the
has anybody tried to do like RL in the
loop of a sim with Comp Cam?

Now, I know that a lot of the Sims are
Now, I know that a lot of the Sims are
very, very slow,
very, very slow,
but I'm wondering like to what extent
but I'm wondering like to what extent
that you make useful fast Sims that
that you make useful fast Sims that
would tell you enough to actually be

able to like RL something, right?

That's kind of the name of the game in

And I would think for at least certain

like stuff like this.
Was this MIT?
Cool.
Oh, and these are nicely annotated for

Yeah, I will have to read through these

been going like all day.
I add things to my reading list to read

Meanwhile,
this stuff
So sometimes what they do is they create

a neural net for each atom to simulate

the end change around them and MD. Yeah,
the end change around them and MD. Yeah,
I you know I've been talking to people
I you know I've been talking to people
that want to go that route as well.
that want to go that route as well.
Um
Um
I'm always pretty hesitant to like
I'm always pretty hesitant to like
replace the SIM with a neural net.
Like is it possible? Yeah, maybe.
Like is it possible? Yeah, maybe.
I kind of wonder if we can just do like
I kind of wonder if we can just do like
a fast sim and rlet.
a fast sim and rlet.
What I should look for in molecular sims
What I should look for in molecular sims
with RL. So look, generally
with RL. So look, generally
reinforcement learning is an interaction

process, right? You control some aspect

that's steering a molecule or like
that's steering a molecule or like

And then there's like an outcome that
And then there's like an outcome that
you're trying to maximize in some way

and it can be pretty loose.
And ideally, we want areas where we can

like simulate stuff fast.

So stuff where like we maybe we just
So stuff where like we maybe we just
have to like do some sort of pretty

new to this area. But generally when you
new to this area. But generally when you
see problems where like you need tons of
see problems where like you need tons of
data and you can make a fast sim and

there's some element of interaction RL

is a good fit.
And that's what we're looking for.
I can just build rail five

We're also pretty good at writing fast

pretty dang good at making stuff fast.
I don't think this is just spamming

I got to go to bed soon.
Oh,
the build's broken. That's why.
Okay.

How does it still not work, man?
like I'm seeing that this play is low.
like I'm going to be very annoyed if

this is just some dumb caching thing.

I am back. Why am I back at 7 p.m.?
I am back. Why am I back at 7 p.m.?
I'm back at 700 p.m. because robotics
I'm back at 700 p.m. because robotics
doesn't make any sense. So, we're going
doesn't make any sense. So, we're going
to see if I can help fix that.
Here were the current experiments. Um,
Here were the current experiments. Um,
what is the best way of doing this? See,
trying to think if we should just go to
trying to think if we should just go to
a harder problem.
You know, let me look at a couple
You know, let me look at a couple

things. Let me just look at a couple,
right?
right?
We'll decide
like this thing. You can understand why
like this thing. You can understand why
it's a pain, right?
Where's like the push T thing?
Oh,
Oh,
this is Wait.
only get to push.
I see.
Is that hard?
That honestly seems worse.
Okay,
Okay,
look at their baselines.
We'll decide from there. Welcome, Twitch
We'll decide from there. Welcome, Twitch
folks.
Where did my chat go?
Where did my chat go?
back under the camera.
We're going to hope that the stream is
We're going to hope that the stream is
stable because uh I don't know what the
stable because uh I don't know what the
weather's doing outside. We've had like
weather's doing outside. We've had like
three different micro bursts in the last
three different micro bursts in the last
two hours.
Weather's kind of wonky around here.
There's this
Okay.
So
So
got pick cube,
got pick cube,
got push cube.
got push cube.
And see this one is slightly harder.
And see this one is slightly harder.
Yes.
And push t

much much longer.
Jack cube

even harder.
even harder.
Then where is it? Peg insertion.
Even harder. Okay, I think
Why the heck would stack Q hard?
We'll start with push T.
That is like a concerning gale outside.
That is like a concerning gale outside.
Holy.
I hope I don't lose my roof. I've got a

lot of nice hardware in here.
I'd like to keep my roof, please.
I think this is it, right? Push TB1.
All right.
All right.
So, the hypothesis here is that

hopefully
hopefully
our setup scales

That's the hope.

Oh, they actually have it in like five

Actually, I I do see here that they have

Okay, that's not bad.
So,
if this works, we can maybe do the uh
if this works, we can maybe do the uh

That cube has like a really stupid

That could just be the reward function

The fact that we're kind of just like

doing robotics out of the box is already

pretty dang good.
It'll get better with optimization,

I could try to get 2048 to work locally
I could try to get 2048 to work locally
in the meantime
here.
It's actually we'll not do it on my
It's actually we'll not do it on my
local. We'll do it on uh on Puffer Max.
Okay. So, this is 2048. This will run
Okay. So, this is 2048. This will run
over here. And uh it looks like this is
over here. And uh it looks like this is
improving. Yes.
Yeah, we're getting somewhere.
That's once
probably. We do just have to tune
probably. We do just have to tune
everything.
everything.
So, I mean, here's an interesting
So, I mean, here's an interesting
question, right?
question, right?
How do we tune everything?
How do we tune everything?
when it has to be multiGPU like this.
Like I can't even run all the M's on one
Like I can't even run all the M's on one
GPU.
Be fair, we don't have to do this all at
Be fair, we don't have to do this all at
once, right? Technically, I can punt on
once, right? Technically, I can punt on
this and just like say we'll get some
this and just like say we'll get some
mostly policies to start with
and then we come back once we have
and then we come back once we have
multiGPU sweeps.
That's a fine approach.
That's a fine approach.
Also, it looks like 2048 is working now.
I think I set this to 40 mil. So, I

O, slow. 140k. 150k.
Are they just like really sample

Yeah, they just solve this in 20 mil,

from the sweep, they may or may not be
any good
any good
because the sweep not every experiment
because the sweep not every experiment
in the sweep is going to work well.
in the sweep is going to work well.
That's the point of it, right? Is that
That's the point of it, right? Is that
it tries a whole bunch of different
it tries a whole bunch of different
things. If you just go like load some
things. If you just go like load some
random stuff from the beep may or may
random stuff from the beep may or may
not be good.
not be good.
But the one it you know reaches the
But the one it you know reaches the
maximum and flattening out that should
maximum and flattening out that should
work. Yes. But then how did you go get
work. Yes. But then how did you go get
that policy? You like go find like the
that policy? You like go find like the
name and Neptune and then the name

locally or what did you do?
locally or what did you do?
Uh I find the name locally and uh trying
Uh I find the name locally and uh trying
to run but it's
to run but it's
not working.
And it shows as one. Does the show go as
And it shows as one. Does the show go as
like that experiment that you loaded
like that experiment that you loaded
shows as one
shows as one
like PF is one? Uh
like PF is one? Uh
can you repeat again what the experiment
can you repeat again what the experiment
that you load for the experiment that
that you load for the experiment that
you loaded uh in the sweep does it show
you loaded uh in the sweep does it show
as having performance one?
Let me stick because I didn't know that.
What's the um so I mean there there are
What's the um so I mean there there are
a few different metrics you can look at
a few different metrics you can look at
there, right? Like there's a there's a
there, right? Like there's a there's a
score metric. The score metric is going
score metric. The score metric is going
to be different for every game or every
to be different for every game or every
environment, right? There's a lot of the
environment, right? There's a lot of the
environments have a perf metric which we
environments have a perf metric which we
do to try to make your life easier. We
do to try to make your life easier. We
try to add a zero to one normalized uh
try to add a zero to one normalized uh
indicator of performance. You just know
indicator of performance. You just know
that like one is good, zero is bad,
that like one is good, zero is bad,
right? We try to make it very easy in
right? We try to make it very easy in
that way. So for pong, one means you're
that way. So for pong, one means you're
getting all the points, right? And in in
getting all the points, right? And in in
the case of Pong, like the maximum score
the case of Pong, like the maximum score
is 20, the maximum perf is one. These
is 20, the maximum perf is one. These
two things mean the same thing.
two things mean the same thing.
Uh can I share my screen to you know get
Uh can I share my screen to you know get
Yeah. better.
Yeah. better.
Let me share my screen.
Hey permission.
Hey permission.
What? Uh
so I'm using Mac. So it's it's uh
so I'm using Mac. So it's it's uh
yeah I don't have permission. Let me
yeah I don't have permission. Let me
there's no there are no permission
there's no there are no permission

you be able to. No no it's on Mac
you be able to. No no it's on Mac
actually. Um
actually. Um
it's a very painful when you try to use
it's a very painful when you try to use
new application you have to give all the
new application you have to give all the

the operating system
[Music]
so you can see my screen. Second
Yeah, I think you can see now. Yeah.
Okay.
So,
So,
yeah. So uh so the learn 15 is the one
yeah. So uh so the learn 15 is the one
that I
that I
executed with your command like with uh
executed with your command like with uh
buffer CLI. Hang on. And it is actually
buffer CLI. Hang on. And it is actually
pretty good. It's it's the best best
pretty good. It's it's the best best
um settings I would say. I'm looking at
um settings I would say. I'm looking at
these.
these.
So I see
So I see
uh almost all of those look like they
uh almost all of those look like they
work.
work.
Yeah. Let's say um
yeah 15 is is I know it's working
yeah 15 is is I know it's working
because it's uh it's using the CLA but
because it's uh it's using the CLA but
let's say um
let's say um
second one
second one
this is also good right
this is also good right
looks like it. Yeah. Yeah. If
looks like it. Yeah. Yeah. If
if I try. So I'm still, you know, using
if I try. So I'm still, you know, using
the sweep to test it out like the one
the sweep to test it out like the one
running now. I think Yeah. Is it
I think 16 also kind of a you know it's
I think 16 also kind of a you know it's
flattened out.
flattened out.
Well, it's Yeah, it's trained like
Well, it's Yeah, it's trained like
I can't tell exactly. It looks like
I can't tell exactly. It looks like
looks like that's a solved run.
looks like that's a solved run.
Mhm. So, let me um I open it.
Mhm. So, let me um I open it.
This is different.
This is different.
Uh
it's uh experiments and
it's uh experiments and
learn 16.
I'm ID guys, so maybe you won't like it,
I'm ID guys, so maybe you won't like it,
but yeah,
but yeah,
you're allowed to use an I don't care if
you're allowed to use an I don't care if
people use an ID. That's fine as long as
people use an ID. That's fine as long as
they don't submit the garbage AI
they don't submit the garbage AI
generated code.
If I hit enter,
it's not completed yet because there's a
it's not completed yet because there's a
model in there. You could load
this one. Yeah.
this one. Yeah.
is is
is is
you can just copy the path.
Wow. Something's changed.
Wow. Something's changed.
Something has changed between those two.
Something has changed between those two.
Like I don't know if that's not a model
Like I don't know if that's not a model
for the same environment or something.
You're using an LSTM, right?
Uh okay. I think now it will run because
Uh okay. I think now it will run because
uh it just finished.
uh it just finished.
So I I didn't use anything uh like
So I I didn't use anything uh like
custom. I just you know ran you know the
custom. I just you know ran you know the
command mentioned on the yeah docs.
command mentioned on the yeah docs.
So if I hit right now see
Good work.
Good work.
Oh, really?
Oh, really?
Okay.
Okay.
the current model. Oh, it's a it's it's
the current model. Oh, it's a it's it's

a it's a snake. You're running snake. I
I
I
Yeah.
Uh, for some reason Oh, yeah. It's super
Uh, for some reason Oh, yeah. It's super
slow for me. I like I get
Yeah. So, as out of 16,
Yeah. So, as out of 16,
why am I not seeing Are you seeing it
why am I not seeing Are you seeing it
play or are you getting like one frame
play or are you getting like one frame
every like like 10 seconds?
I have no idea. Like, oh, now it's doing
I have no idea. Like, oh, now it's doing
so. Hang on.
so. Hang on.
Mhm. Uh,
gray is 11 and blue is zero.
Oh. Um, okay.
Oh. Um, okay.
Is there a frame skip parameter
Is there a frame skip parameter
difference?
difference?
So when you ran sweep, part of the sweep
So when you ran sweep, part of the sweep
is the frame skip.
I didn't do any sort of uh Yeah, but
I didn't do any sort of uh Yeah, but
like like it'll do it for you. So if you
like like it'll do it for you. So if you
look at your config,
look at your config,
okay,
okay,
you look at the phone config.
You know where that is?
You know where that is?
Here 16. No, I'm well. Yes, you can look
Here 16. No, I'm well. Yes, you can look
at that first. Go to 16.
That'll work. And now look for frame
That'll work. And now look for frame
skip.
skip.
namescape uh four or no it's two the 16
namescape uh four or no it's two the 16
yeah four okay four now if you go into
yeah four okay four now if you go into
uh well I guess you can just you're
uh well I guess you can just you're
doing it from CLI you can just do d-m
doing it from CLI you can just do d-m
frame skip four and you load the policy
frame skip four and you load the policy
and see what happens
any order
any order
Okay.
Okay.
It's got to be end of frame skip.
Skip. Frame skip.
Four. That does
I think. Yeah, that's the Now it's
I think. Yeah, that's the Now it's
aggressive.
aggressive.
There you go. So, literally all that
There you go. So, literally all that
happened, all that happened here, right,
happened, all that happened here, right,
is that you got this sweep and the sweep
is that you got this sweep and the sweep
includes parameters of the environment
includes parameters of the environment
and then you didn't apply them. You

trained it, you tried to evaluate a
trained it, you tried to evaluate a

from what it was trained for.
from what it was trained for.
Okay. Oh, yeah. So, this is uh good to
Okay. Oh, yeah. So, this is uh good to
know. So, I didn't know that. So, you
know. So, I didn't know that. So, you
know, some of the environments have
know, some of the environments have
parameters like this, right? where like
parameters like this, right? where like
there's a part of the environment
there's a part of the environment
configuration itself that is a part of

the search and uh you just essentially
the search and uh you just essentially
have to be careful to look at your
have to be careful to look at your
config parameters and make sure that you
config parameters and make sure that you
know you're actually evaluating in the
know you're actually evaluating in the
same setting and you'll it'll be pretty
same setting and you'll it'll be pretty
obvious right like stuff like this
obvious right like stuff like this
you'll see that it will not work and
you'll see that it will not work and
obviously you haven't really done much
obviously you haven't really done much
in puffer so you would not know this
in puffer so you would not know this
right but things in puffer generally
right but things in puffer generally
work and they work very very well when
work and they work very very well when
they're not working usually there's some
they're not working usually there's some
gap
gap
Yeah, gap of learning.
Yeah, gap of learning.
So I I I'm actually pretty impressed
So I I I'm actually pretty impressed
with Puffer
with Puffer
to be honest because you know so for
to be honest because you know so for
it's it's it was pretty hard you know if
it's it's it was pretty hard you know if
I compare 100 times you know. Oh yeah,
I compare 100 times you know. Oh yeah,
it's part is is like pretty easy and
it's part is is like pretty easy and
fast. Man, I suffered with uh I suffered
fast. Man, I suffered with uh I suffered
through RLIB for like years in part of
through RLIB for like years in part of
my PhD. Like there's a reason that we
my PhD. Like there's a reason that we
have stuff built the way that it is,
have stuff built the way that it is,
right?
right?
And it's it's built from uh
And it's it's built from uh
there was a lot of pain and suffering
there was a lot of pain and suffering
that was gone through order to make all
that was gone through order to make all
this stuff work the way it is.
this stuff work the way it is.
Oh, it's a yeah, I was pretty impressed
Oh, it's a yeah, I was pretty impressed
to be honest. Yeah, I even I cannot
to be honest. Yeah, I even I cannot
think like you know my learning rate is
think like you know my learning rate is
kind of exponential right now because
kind of exponential right now because
everything is working and I'm confident.
everything is working and I'm confident.
Well, I mean it's you'll have to get
Well, I mean it's you'll have to get
deeper into stuff at at some point,
deeper into stuff at at some point,
right? Um but hey, there are a lot of of

usually, honestly, the best thing for

has anybody tried to do like RL in the
has anybody tried to do like RL in the
loop of a sim with Comp Cam?

Now, I know that a lot of the Sims are
Now, I know that a lot of the Sims are
very, very slow,
very, very slow,
but I'm wondering like to what extent
but I'm wondering like to what extent
that you make useful fast Sims that
that you make useful fast Sims that
would tell you enough to actually be

like stuff like this.
Was this MIT?
Cool.
Oh, and these are nicely annotated for

Yeah, I will have to read through these

the end change around them and MD. Yeah,
the end change around them and MD. Yeah,
I you know I've been talking to people
I you know I've been talking to people
that want to go that route as well.
that want to go that route as well.
Um
Um
I'm always pretty hesitant to like
I'm always pretty hesitant to like
replace the SIM with a neural net.
Like is it possible? Yeah, maybe.
Like is it possible? Yeah, maybe.
I kind of wonder if we can just do like
I kind of wonder if we can just do like
a fast sim and rlet.
a fast sim and rlet.
What I should look for in molecular sims
What I should look for in molecular sims
with RL. So look, generally
with RL. So look, generally
reinforcement learning is an interaction

process, right? You control some aspect

that's steering a molecule or like
that's steering a molecule or like
making edits to a specific thing or

And then there's like an outcome that
And then there's like an outcome that
you're trying to maximize in some way

and it can be pretty loose.
And ideally, we want areas where we can

like simulate stuff fast.

So stuff where like we maybe we just

have to like do some sort of pretty

new to this area. But generally when you
new to this area. But generally when you
see problems where like you need tons of
see problems where like you need tons of
data and you can make a fast sim and

there's some element of interaction RL
there's some element of interaction RL
is a good fit.
