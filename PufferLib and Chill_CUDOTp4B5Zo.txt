it'll be simpler to code as a first

It'll probably look better if you just

make a normal platformer and then figure

Perhaps buffering issues. You play
Perhaps buffering issues. You play
problems, too. Oh, that's weird. Um, so
problems, too. Oh, that's weird. Um, so
yeah, what I would basically probably
yeah, what I would basically probably
do, there are a few different things you
do, there are a few different things you
can look at for this.
But like
I'd probably do something like this,
I'd probably do something like this,
right? You have your platformer
this.
Okay, you make it depends if you want
Okay, you make it depends if you want
this to be on a grid or not, right? Like
this to be on a grid or not, right? Like
it'll look better not on a grid, but
it'll look better not on a grid, but
it'll be simpler to code as a first
it'll be simpler to code as a first
environment depending on your skill
environment depending on your skill
level, not uh if you actually use a
level, not uh if you actually use a
grid. So on a grid, it would be
grid. So on a grid, it would be
something like this,
something like this,
right? Where you actually you have all
right? Where you actually you have all
the blocks or like the platforms are
the blocks or like the platforms are
made up of blocks. Then you have like
made up of blocks. Then you have like
your agent here, which is going to be
your agent here, which is going to be
like I don't know a fish,
like I don't know a fish,
okay? And then the fish sees sees some
okay? And then the fish sees sees some
sort of block around it.
sort of block around it.
Sees like this. This
Sees like this. This
they should the block should actually be
they should the block should actually be
aligned, right?
Um, so it sees some sort of thing like
Um, so it sees some sort of thing like
this. And then it probably also needs to
this. And then it probably also needs to
know like its local position in the
know like its local position in the
block. So get the physics jumps right.
block. So get the physics jumps right.
Something like that.
Otherwise, you're going to have to do
Otherwise, you're going to have to do
something a bit fancier. It's totally
something a bit fancier. It's totally
possible to do it not on a grid. Still
possible to do it not on a grid. Still
have it make sense. Like you could
have it make sense. Like you could
literally just if you did it not on a
literally just if you did it not on a
grid, it would be something like this,
grid, it would be something like this,
right? And you just have like a normal
right? And you just have like a normal
platformer. And all you do is um
platformer. And all you do is um
maybe it's better not on a grid.
maybe it's better not on a grid.
Frankly, it'll look way better not on a
Frankly, it'll look way better not on a
grid. Um,
grid. Um,
you just give it like the position of
you just give it like the position of
the nearest platforms, right? So, it
the nearest platforms, right? So, it
knows like
knows like
x y and then it gets like dx
x y and then it gets like dx
dy
dx
something like this. I mean, you can do
something like this. I mean, you can do
it a lot of ways, right?
It'll probably look better if you just
It'll probably look better if you just
make a normal platformer and then figure
make a normal platformer and then figure
out how to do observations though
cuz when you lock everything to a grid,
cuz when you lock everything to a grid,
everything kind of looks like a toy.
Like you get stuff like this looks
Like you get stuff like this looks
pretty toy.
Yeah, I don't think it'll be that hard.
Yeah, I don't think it'll be that hard.
