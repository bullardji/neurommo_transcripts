folks. How's it going?
So, today we're going to be working on

drone stuff.
One second Yeah.
All right.
All right.
So, let me uh let me talk a little bit

We're going to have to wait to see how
We're going to have to wait to see how
the slope compares to the other

is looking good.

Okay. But I'm all uh I'm sick of like
Okay. But I'm all uh I'm sick of like
running fiddly little experiments. So,
running fiddly little experiments. So,
what we're going to do today is we're
what we're going to do today is we're
going to build the new drone out.
This is going to be
very similar here. Uh we want to divide
very similar here. Uh we want to divide
this number
this number
let's say 64

What's that? Is that 32?

Oh no, I'm dumb. Time 16
going to be 16 M's.
going to be 16 M's.
We'll have 64 agents each

I'll describe that in more detail uh
I'll describe that in more detail uh

total number of agents. So if I want
there to be like eight environments with

a,024 agents each, right? And then I
a,024 agents each, right? And then I
want to have 64 agents per instance,
want to have 64 agents per instance,
then I need 16 instances per process. 16

that's fine. The thing is it's like it's
that's fine. The thing is it's like it's
way better if we get a cheaper one for

this is good, right?
Let's see if we can get the logs to be

okay, so this is way better.
okay, so this is way better.
Much more stable.
Yeah. So, this is kind of weird how this
Yeah. So, this is kind of weird how this
is working.
What is the ideal score under That's
Like this is not as good as the other
Like this is not as good as the other
one. Yeah.
pretty low value loss.
So, the thing I'm a little confused on
So, the thing I'm a little confused on
here, right, is uh the way the reward is
here, right, is uh the way the reward is
structured, it's actually kind of tough
get like a global perfect
get like a global perfect

Oh, we just have to This is actually not

We just present it one. We just present

See if this works. So, the idea here is

that this is
that this is
uh this is actually going to tell us how

It's harder to learn, but it's more
It's harder to learn, but it's more
accurate for Eval. So, let's let's see
accurate for Eval. So, let's let's see
if this does something more reasonable
if this does something more reasonable
for us.
Okay, so this score variable,
Okay, so this score variable,
this keeps going up.
Cool.
We'll see uh the difference quite
We'll see uh the difference quite
readily here, right?

These episode returns are very similar

and they don't look like great. It's
and they don't look like great. It's
kind of hard to tell what's happening,
kind of hard to tell what's happening,
but then we we go by score.
but then we we go by score.
We have a clean learning curve.
Okay. So, how do we get this to be
Okay. So, how do we get this to be
better.
Are they missing observation data for
Are they missing observation data for
this task?
Guess it would be nice to have the
Guess it would be nice to have the
reward components maybe.
Not missing data other than that though.
Try uh just one other thing here.
This should just be hover.
We'll see if they do that successfully.
Evidently the uh Yeah, that's not what I
Evidently the uh Yeah, that's not what I
expected, but it makes sense that I it
expected, but it makes sense that I it
does that
does that
funny.
I think what I'd like to do is see if I
I think what I'd like to do is see if I
can get this sim to have like a few
can get this sim to have like a few
different obvious tasks for the drones
and uh have it be like interactive so
and uh have it be like interactive so
you can kind of play with them.
We can do like hover orbit.
and follow maybe
hover, orbit, and follow would be decent
hover, orbit, and follow would be decent
ones, I'd say.
I'm studying Sutton's reinforcement
I'm studying Sutton's reinforcement
learning book. Well,
a whole bunch of math.
Oh, this is
Oh, this is
is the previous position.
is the previous position.
Just use this
We're going to make this like an
We're going to make this like an
interactive thing. I guess this is kind
interactive thing. I guess this is kind
of like an evolution of some of the
of like an evolution of some of the
other multi-agent MS I've done, but now
other multi-agent MS I've done, but now
it's going to actually be with drones
it's going to actually be with drones
and we're going to make it like nice and
and we're going to make it like nice and
interactive. I think we'll do it so that
interactive. I think we'll do it so that
like
like
we're going to see if we can jointly
we're going to see if we can jointly
train the agents on a bunch of different
train the agents on a bunch of different
tasks pretty much

and then have you be able to select a
and then have you be able to select a
test time.
Yeah. And we'll just randomize at the
Yeah. And we'll just randomize at the
end level on reset.
Okay, it looks like it's learned
Okay, it looks like it's learned
something here. Well, whatever it's
something here. Well, whatever it's
learned here is uh is what the actual
learned here is uh is what the actual
task is because these scores are good.
So this should just be Yeah, this is
So this should just be Yeah, this is
just the hover task. So the drones learn
just the hover task. So the drones learn
to hover.
to hover.
That works perfectly.
Yes.
Basic hover task.
Obviously I have some visual stuff to

fix, but pretty good.
Let's do
Let's do

Uh, this is weird.
Yes, you've got two environments. That
Yes, you've got two environments. That
is a very silly number of environments

Uh, this should not be the same thing.
Uh, this should not be the same thing.
Something is weird here.
Okay, what about this follow task?
Okay, what about this follow task?
We know how to do the follow task,
We know how to do the follow task,
right?
right?
Just have to make a target point.
You just do like vect 3
target pause.
there.
there.
Easy.
So, this has a pretty negative score.
Okay. So, they do hover, which is weird.
We'll fix that.
We'll fix that.
But for now,
add four to this 28.

But let me let me look at that.
That's a very legitimate possibility.
Not optimized either.
Use a restroom while this trains real

quick and we'll see what this does.
Okay. So, this does

actually improve.
actually improve.
We'll see to what extent.
Okay, this is the orbit task. It's not

Okay, we can now do the individual

Oh, you know why? I know why this

doesn't work. Actually, I know exactly
doesn't work. Actually, I know exactly
how to fix this.
It wasn't randomizing during training.
We'll see what difference this uh

Be able to get something today.
This
Oh, cool.
Well, this definitely did something.
I don't know if I would call it an

At least it does. It does actually
At least it does. It does actually
random uh reset correctly, I would
random uh reset correctly, I would
suppose. Now,
suppose. Now,
so again, if this doesn't work, we go
so again, if this doesn't work, we go
one by one in the tasks and then if it
one by one in the tasks and then if it
works with all the tasks and doesn't
works with all the tasks and doesn't
work together, it's probably just a
work together, it's probably just a

Yeah, this looks pretty similar. Kind of

just a noisy version.

we'll see.
Yeah, that's not orbiting behavior,

Yeah. So right here
I do add a log here though.
Whatever. Let's see what this guy does.
They kind of just do whatever they feel

It's a pretty cool thing for them to do,

Uh, why would this happen?
Perfectly reasonable reward.

Yeah. Took them a little longer to

figure it out, but they hover.
So, that's So far,
that's two down, two to go.
that's two down, two to go.
And then we have to do the uh the fun

We probably need to normalize all the

What's like the tan HF function that

What is the ideal score under That's

pretty low value loss.
So, the thing I'm a little confused on

here, right, is uh the way the reward is

structured, it's actually kind of tough

It's harder to learn, but it's more

if this does something more reasonable

for us.
Okay, so this score variable,
Okay, so this score variable,
this keeps going up.
Cool.
We'll see uh the difference quite

but then we we go by score.
but then we we go by score.
We have a clean learning curve.
Okay. So, how do we get this to be
Okay. So, how do we get this to be
better.
Are they missing observation data for
Are they missing observation data for
this task?
Guess it would be nice to have the
Guess it would be nice to have the
reward components maybe.
Not missing data other than that though.
Try uh just one other thing here.
This should just be hover.
We'll see if they do that successfully.
Evidently the uh Yeah, that's not what I
Evidently the uh Yeah, that's not what I
expected, but it makes sense that I it
expected, but it makes sense that I it
does that
does that
funny.
I think what I'd like to do is see if I
I think what I'd like to do is see if I
can get this sim to have like a few
can get this sim to have like a few
different obvious tasks for the drones
and uh have it be like interactive so
and uh have it be like interactive so
you can kind of play with them.
We can do like hover orbit.
and follow maybe

ones, I'd say.
I'm studying Sutton's reinforcement

a whole bunch of math.
Oh, this is

Just use this
We're going to make this like an

other multi-agent MS I've done, but now

it's going to actually be with drones
it's going to actually be with drones
and we're going to make it like nice and
and we're going to make it like nice and

interactive. I think we'll do it so that
like
like
we're going to see if we can jointly

and then have you be able to select a

Yeah. And we'll just randomize at the
Yeah. And we'll just randomize at the
end level on reset.
Okay, it looks like it's learned
Okay, it looks like it's learned
something here. Well, whatever it's
something here. Well, whatever it's
learned here is uh is what the actual
learned here is uh is what the actual
task is because these scores are good.
So this should just be Yeah, this is
So this should just be Yeah, this is
just the hover task. So the drones learn
just the hover task. So the drones learn
to hover.
to hover.
That works perfectly.
Yes.
Basic hover task.
Obviously I have some visual stuff to

Something is weird here.
Okay, what about this follow task?
Okay, what about this follow task?
We know how to do the follow task,

right?
right?
Just have to make a target point.
You just do like vect 3

Easy.
So, this has a pretty negative score.
Okay. So, they do hover, which is weird.
We'll fix that.
We'll fix that.

I don't know if I would call it an

At least it does. It does actually

so again, if this doesn't work, we go
so again, if this doesn't work, we go
one by one in the tasks and then if it

works with all the tasks and doesn't

We probably need to normalize all the
