that was apparently a tornado and it
that was apparently a tornado and it
killed nine people. Jesus. Yeah.
So, uh, probably a good thing I didn't
So, uh, probably a good thing I didn't
decide to go out for a run in that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jeez. Oh, lord. I was like until it
Jeez. Oh, lord. I was like until it
starts like thundering. I was super

heavy rain.
Well, be glad you did. Yeah. Yeah.
Well, be glad you did. Yeah. Yeah.

my head. There's uh a portion of the
path that I go Well, there's actually a

good chunk of the path that I go through
good chunk of the path that I go through
is like under a ton of

Yeah, it's not the prettiest, but it's
Yeah, it's not the prettiest, but it's
functional.
All right. Yeah, let's make for it.
All right. Yeah, let's make for it.
Okay. Ender PR.
You pushed something earlier. Yeah. So,
You pushed something earlier. Yeah. So,
I need to sync up. Yeah. I gave you
I need to sync up. Yeah. I gave you

Dozer is not yet, but land

and like put him on some C cuz I bet you
and like put him on some C cuz I bet you
that he would uh I bet you like anything
that he would uh I bet you like anything
you put Costa on, he just like makes 10x
you put Costa on, he just like makes 10x

I'm sure he's he's probably going to do
I'm sure he's he's probably going to do
his start his own thing or something
his start his own thing or something
would be my guess. He's uh yeah, he's he

has a very particular set of skills.
You got PR? No PR. No PR. Patience.
You got PR? No PR. No PR. Patience.
Patience.
Patience.
Patience is not a virtue and I have
none. All right. Was that the only merge
none. All right. Was that the only merge
conflict?
Yeah. Make sure it still renders
Yeah. Make sure it still renders
properly.
properly.
There's no reason why it shouldn't.
Oh my god, what just happened? I'll be
Oh my god, what just happened? I'll be
able to render this
thing. Be dozer
time. Why did this camera just like
time. Why did this camera just like
explode?
All right, we're going to turn off this
All right, we're going to turn off this
weird camera control thing for now and
weird camera control thing for now and
I'll send it over to
you. I'll make a change to it in a sec,
you. I'll make a change to it in a sec,
but I'll just send this to you. So, you
but I'll just send this to you. So, you
have something to start with.
Okie do. Let's make a
PR. I think as soon as we get like the
PR. I think as soon as we get like the
basics of this, it's going to start
basics of this, it's going to start
looking really cool and it's going to be
looking really cool and it's going to be
like super fun to to dev this terraform
like super fun to to dev this terraform
right there. There you
right there. There you
go. Good.
Uh, you actually added like controls and
Uh, you actually added like controls and
[ __ ] Okay,
[ __ ] Okay,
I had to come comment out the controls
I had to come comment out the controls
on one part. It's being weird.

All right, so we will uh merge your pull

the the controls that will work for now
the the controls that will work for now
is the zooming in and out, but I got to
is the zooming in and out, but I got to
get the the mouse position like drag
get the the mouse position like drag
thing

better being weird cuz we're using it's
better being weird cuz we're using it's
like using different dimensions now cuz
this
[ __ ] the controls for this

um you just have mouse wheel zoom in
um you just have mouse wheel zoom in
zoom out and you should be able to stare
zoom out and you should be able to stare
at the the

thing. Let me pull up your stream so I
can see what you're doing. Mouse is like
can see what you're doing. Mouse is like
inverted or
something. It's this thing for now,
something. It's this thing for now,
right?
right?
Mhm. Oh, does your Oh, your thing's kind
Mhm. Oh, does your Oh, your thing's kind
of doing correctly. What
of doing correctly. What
did you did you uncomment the the

commented in the PR though.
commented in the PR though.
Well, it's backwards is the thing. It's
Well, it's backwards is the thing. It's
really like jank. Oh, just make it
a All right. So, we have this thing and
a All right. So, we have this thing and
then like presumably
then like presumably
it just needs lighting is all like it
it just needs lighting is all like it
needs lighting in order to work
needs lighting in order to work
correctly, right?
um in order to like see like are you
um in order to like see like are you
talking about like well we can't shadows
talking about like well we can't shadows
are forcibly not shadows it's not
are forcibly not shadows it's not
shadows it's the it's like the angle
shadows it's the it's like the angle
right it's like so that you get
right it's like so that you get
different shading on different angles
different shading on different angles
yeah I can do that well I guess it's
yeah I can do that well I guess it's
it's not really going to do much
it's not really going to do much
until I guess it'll already kind of do
until I guess it'll already kind of do
something I mean cool there's the end
something I mean cool there's the end
though um wait why is it that small
cuz it's that small. It's 11 by 11. But
cuz it's that small. It's 11 by 11. But
I messed that up.
You didn't make it
big. Okay. Well, now the camera
big. Okay. Well, now the camera
centering is like completely screwed or
centering is like completely screwed or
something because it doesn't there's
something because it doesn't there's
nothing that shows up if I make it
128.
So, we need to get like the basics of
So, we need to get like the basics of
this thing, I think, before we can do um
this thing, I think, before we can do um
figure out the really the digging
figure out the really the digging
pieces,
right? Let me figure out how we would
right? Let me figure out how we would
render
render
render a height map.
All right, let me mess with
All right, let me mess with
the the size thing that you
the the size thing that you
did. All right. Why is size being funky?
All right, I fixed it.
All right, I fixed it.
Okay,
Okay,
it's a it's a change you can just do on
it's a it's a change you can just do on
your end. Um, what is it?
your end. Um, what is it?
What you do is you look in the make
client line 185 a nit window. Just make
client line 185 a nit window. Just make
it a fixed 800 by 600.
Okay. Holy, look at that.
Okay. So, I mean, we can't really see
Okay. So, I mean, we can't really see
what the hell's going on here. And like
what the hell's going on here. And like
the controls are backwards and things,
the controls are backwards and things,
but that's something.
Also, I think it's like there's not very
Also, I think it's like there's not very
much variation in the height, is there?
much variation in the height, is there?
No, there's not. You have to change the
No, there's not. You have to change the
factor to be Yeah. Um, okay. I think I
factor to be Yeah. Um, okay. I think I
changed it to one over four, but just
changed it to one over four, but just
make it like two or something.
make it like two or something.
Well, there are two things happening,
Well, there are two things happening,
right? So, there's the pearl and noise,
right? So, there's the pearl and noise,
the math height, and then there's the
the math height, and then there's the
render height.
Um, well, render height's just one right
Um, well, render height's just one right
now.
now.
Or it just it just like a one. It's
Or it just it just like a one. It's
based off the exact value. It's one to
based off the exact value. It's one to
one. So, if you add a multiplier to it,
one. So, if you add a multiplier to it,
I mean, you probably could see massive
I mean, you probably could see massive
differences, but that wouldn't be like
differences, but that wouldn't be like
accurate, per say. Yeah. All right. So,
accurate, per say. Yeah. All right. So,
let's
let's
like
like
Yeah. All right. Can you figure that
Yeah. All right. Can you figure that
stuff out? I'm gonna see if I I'm gonna
stuff out? I'm gonna see if I I'm gonna
see if I can figure out this like
see if I can figure out this like
meshing. Yeah. Make it like all sorts of
meshing. Yeah. Make it like all sorts of
choppy.
choppy.
Like make it look like some hills or
Like make it look like some hills or
whatever, right? Not like choppy. You
whatever, right? Not like choppy. You
want like some hills. All right.
Raib have a
mech.
Does Okay, so Red Lib does have a thing
Does Okay, so Red Lib does have a thing
for this.
All right. So I
think is
interesting. Going to do this locally so
interesting. Going to do this locally so
I can actually render things.
I think whoever told me to keep my neck
I think whoever told me to keep my neck
spray was on to this something because
spray was on to this something because
[ __ ] everything kind of

Yeah. Breakfast Chick-fil-A, dude. They
Yeah. Breakfast Chick-fil-A, dude. They
got spicy chicken biscuits. All right. I
got spicy chicken biscuits. All right. I
had a lot of Chick-fil-A in my uh
had a lot of Chick-fil-A in my uh
undergrad. No, not undergrad in PhD.
The breakfast of champions.
My breakfast included a full pot of

Did you
Did you
um My next thing was going to work on
um My next thing was going to work on
making it look decent with hills. Did
making it look decent with hills. Did
you said you when I was walking away, I
you said you when I was walking away, I
overheard you saying something like Oh,
overheard you saying something like Oh,
I'm looking into the mesh gen. I'm
I'm looking into the mesh gen. I'm
trying to figure out mesh gen stuff
trying to figure out mesh gen stuff
right now.
right now.
So, yeah. get the terrain to like
So, yeah. get the terrain to like
generate correct heights while I mess
generate correct heights while I mess
with this uh this mesh gen to see if we
with this uh this mesh gen to see if we
can have like instead of just drawing
can have like instead of just drawing
cubes.
width
width
length res x Let's see.
Okay. Then I got to figure out what the
Okay. Then I got to figure out what the
mesh is.
Wait. Models heightmap.
Save. That looks
good. Then mesh height
map. Huh?
I feel like I'm not getting a lot of
I feel like I'm not getting a lot of
good values from this preent noise right
good values from this preent noise right
now. So there's octaves and then there's
now. So there's octaves and then there's
the frequency.
Okay, I
Okay, I
found
found
something.
Think so.
What is the role of octaves verse
What is the role of octaves verse
frequency in Berlin noise?
frequency in Berlin noise?
So
So
octaves octave is how many different
octaves octave is how many different
waveforms get summed together like you
waveforms get summed together like you
get like
get like
a kind of like a hilly map out of each
a kind of like a hilly map out of each
octave. Uh but they're at different
octave. Uh but they're at different
frequencies. Some of them are like going
frequencies. Some of them are like going
to be like very bumpy. Some of them are
to be like very bumpy. Some of them are
going to be like big hills, right? And
going to be like big hills, right? And
then the frequency defines
then the frequency defines
um like actually how big or how small
um like actually how big or how small
the hills are like how like spread
the hills are like how like spread
together pushed apart they are.
together pushed apart they are.
the frequency you said does that. Yeah.
the frequency you said does that. Yeah.
So like probably like I don't know two
So like probably like I don't know two
to four octaves and then play with the
to four octaves and then play with the
frequency until you get something that
frequency until you get something that
looks
reasonable. It's probably not going to
reasonable. It's probably not going to
generate data in like the height scale
generate data in like the height scale
that you're looking for though. Like you
that you're looking for though. Like you
might have to multiply the height the
might have to multiply the height the
thing. Yeah, that's what I did. I'm
thing. Yeah, that's what I did. I'm
adding a a height scale factor.
And I'm just going to make it
And I'm just going to make it
giganto. And then I think I just need
giganto. And then I think I just need
more things to end
more things to end
probably cuz I think what's going to
probably cuz I think what's going to
happen is you're just going to end with
gaps. You know what I mean? Uh what do
gaps. You know what I mean? Uh what do
you mean gaps?
you mean gaps?
like between the space of
like between the space of
Oh, well, we're going to make we're
Oh, well, we're going to make we're
going to get like a proper mesh renderer
going to get like a proper mesh renderer
for this thing.
for this thing.
Cuz if I'm just drawing cubes, I think
Cuz if I'm just drawing cubes, I think
what it will do is just spawn cubes far
what it will do is just spawn cubes far
apart from each other if you go super
hilly. So, I need some way to like
draw between cubes at the next spot
arguably.
arguably.
Well, it's that's going to be done by
Well, it's that's going to be done by
the height map thing,
right? Okay. So, I found the
right? Okay. So, I found the
implementation of this
Okay, so now we have the source code for
Okay, so now we have the source code for
how they generate meshes.
how they generate meshes.
Okay,
so I think I can just like take this and
so I think I can just like take this and
we can edit this to not have to load
we can edit this to not have to load
from a freaking
image. That would be ideal.
just do Take
I got to say race's getting a few
I got to say race's getting a few
demerits for the uh new line curly
demerits for the uh new line curly
braces.
Okay. Like, yeah,
Okay. Like, yeah,
maybe maybe
maybe maybe
this. We will see.
Are you a
troll? Everything's the same color.
troll? Everything's the same color.
like can't tell the difference. Yeah,
like can't tell the difference. Yeah,
we'll fix that. There's actually cuz we
we'll fix that. There's actually cuz we
can actually get um we're going to be
can actually get um we're going to be
able to apply like a a checker texture
able to apply like a a checker texture
to it super
to it super
easily. Going to be
easily. Going to be
nice. Right. So, we've got this mesh and
nice. Right. So, we've got this mesh and
[Music]
[Music]
then come
on. Where's their
API? Load model from mesh.
probably like draw a mesh or something,
probably like draw a mesh or something,
right?
Model then it is

position probably
like rotation or some weird
thing. We'll comment
this. There we go. Yeah, that's

okay. I
okay. I
mean, not quite what we're going for,
mean, not quite what we're going for,
but let's see if we can get this thing
but let's see if we can get this thing
checkerboard textured.
Yeah, I got a similar thing right now
Yeah, I got a similar thing right now
going on mine.
going on mine.
There's
There's
um checkerboard texture
thing. Let's just do something like
this. Why is it that when you block
this. Why is it that when you block
YouTube
messages Oh, you have to add to the
messages Oh, you have to add to the
other block list. There we go. That gets
other block list. There we go. That gets
this messages off my screen.
Welcome,
major. This will start looking cool, I
major. This will start looking cool, I
think, as soon as I get the

um textures applied.
that checked

Okay. It's just

I got a similar thing going as well, but
I got a similar thing going as well, but
I'm not seeing like with what with the
I'm not seeing like with what with the
Are you drawing rectangles though? No,
Are you drawing rectangles though? No,
I'm using the gen height mesh from Ray
I'm using the gen height mesh from Ray
Live. Oh, okay. So I just I don't know
Live. Oh, okay. So I just I don't know
why we're duplicating work. So I just
why we're duplicating work. So I just
did the same thing. I modified that
did the same thing. I modified that
function so that it wouldn't we wouldn't
function so that it wouldn't we wouldn't
have to go through an image.
So it just loads it from our map data.
Yeah. I mean, but I feel like you and I
Yeah. I mean, but I feel like you and I
are both have like a similar issue right
are both have like a similar issue right
now where it's kind of hard to
now where it's kind of hard to
determine. I don't think I just don't

No, I know. And that's I'm trying to
No, I know. And that's I'm trying to
mess with that via screwing with height
mess with that via screwing with height
scaling, but even then it's like not
scaling, but even then it's like not
getting a All right. Well, let's figure
getting a All right. Well, let's figure
that out.
I have a different version than you, I
I have a different version than you, I
guess.
But feel like the heights should be like

crazy, but they're really not.

sufficiently spiky.
Now it's like
Now it's like
now it's like ultra spicy.

Well, probably
Well, probably

See, it's actually

right? Well, okay. Okay. I think your
right? Well, okay. Okay. I think your
version is like much cleaner than mine

right now because when I try and do
right now because when I try and do
something like that, the checkerboard is
something like that, the checkerboard is
not checkering hard enough. I mean, I
not checkering hard enough. I mean, I
don't know. I was worried that after
don't know. I was worried that after
I've been letting you write all the Sims
I've been letting you write all the Sims
for a while, you know, I was going to be
for a while, you know, I was going to be
rusty,
but nope.
All right. Push up your stuff and let me
All right. Push up your stuff and let me
and then Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One sec. Let
and then Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One sec. Let
me give you the original scale which was
me give you the original scale which was
the originally correct
number. All right. So this is this and
number. All right. So this is this and
then let's give
you height map
you height map
like I don't know like two
That's a cool looking
mesh.
mesh.
Holy We want
Wait.
Wait.
Huh?
Map. I'm
confused. Yeah, I think we uh I think
confused. Yeah, I think we uh I think
that this pearl and noise function is
that this pearl and noise function is
kind of screwy. So, we're going to leave
kind of screwy. So, we're going to leave
this at two for
now and then we'll give you this. I
now and then we'll give you this. I
mean, I feel like two created like a
decent. All right. So, I'm going to give
decent. All right. So, I'm going to give
you this mesh to play with. All right.
I'm going to see if I can fix the uh
I'm going to see if I can fix the uh
pearl
pearl
noise generation function.
Holy Mesh

Yeah, this is hilly as [ __ ]
Yeah, this is hilly as [ __ ]
Think we can terraform it?

Yeah, dude.
Yeah, dude.
We got to make it look like Mars.
My lord. Just like freaking do all this
My lord. Just like freaking do all this
stuff.
All right. So, what did you do for this?
All right. So, what did you do for this?
Did you find some function online?
Did you find some function online?
Huh? No. I just I took the source for
Huh? No. I just I took the source for
the like you were looking at the same
the like you were looking at the same
function. It's just I took the source of
function. It's just I took the source of
it. Oh, I actually By the way, I like we
it. Oh, I actually By the way, I like we
have real terrain now. Look at this
have real terrain now. Look at this
[ __ ] Look at this. It's like actually
[ __ ] Look at this. It's like actually
multi octave pearling.
multi octave pearling.
Oh, let me look at your stream
Oh, let me look at your stream
proper.
Oh, I'm not live. Okay, that was why I
Oh, I'm not live. Okay, that was why I
was tripping out. So, this is what
was tripping out. So, this is what
Pearl's actually supposed to do for you.
Pearl's actually supposed to do for you.
See how it's like multi octave?
See how it's like multi octave?
Mhm. That's some Mars
Mhm. That's some Mars
terrain. There you go. That's more
terrain. There you go. That's more
reasonable to work with. Yeah. There you
reasonable to work with. Yeah. There you
go.
Yeah, that's pretty cool.
Uhhuh. You can't leave it on green,
Uhhuh. You can't leave it on green,
obviously.
I sense a puffer color coming. Puffer
I sense a puffer color coming. Puffer
colors.
Oh yeah, that's way better.
But this thing to be like 720p Okay.
Are you trying to change your angle or
Are you trying to change your angle or
you just your
spawn? I don't know.
Trying to just get something that we can
Trying to just get something that we can
like see the whole terrain without
like see the whole terrain without
having to just roll every
having to just roll every
time. All right, that's not
bad. That's some terrain, right? Mhm.
Arguably that's like really difficult to
Arguably that's like really difficult to
work with terrain. Oh yeah.
Like most sites are not going to be that

So, we probably want to gen the instead
So, we probably want to gen the instead
of scaling the
height. We're going to make it one to

And then are you just going to scale it
And then are you just going to scale it
in the map? No, I'm doing I'm doing it
in the map? No, I'm doing I'm doing it
right I'm fixing it to
be I'm fixing it to be prehawk.
Wait, you have a Oh, that's a different
Wait, you have a Oh, that's a different
scale. Oh, that's a normaliz. Yeah,
scale. Oh, that's a normaliz. Yeah,
that's a normalized.
Arguably, should you apply your scale to
Arguably, should you apply your scale to
the post-normalized version?
Yeah. Okay, that's what you should do.
Yeah. Okay, that's what you should do.
All right, that's like that's good.
All right, that's like that's good.
That's like now actually what we see. So
That's like now actually what we see. So
now we can render the dozer on top of

just called being a noob.
I um I was trying to figure out why my

supposed to be like five.
Oh,
okay. I think we're going to not
okay. I think we're going to not
actually move the dozers to start
with physical AI stuff like robots.
We've done some gem stuff for robots,
We've done some gem stuff for robots,
but we haven't done physical hardware.
but we haven't done physical hardware.
We might be able to do some fun physical
We might be able to do some fun physical
hardware stuff with dish. We'll see. All
hardware stuff with dish. We'll see. All
right. So, there's some dozers. They're
right. So, there's some dozers. They're
just
cubes. For

now, kind of at weird heights.
now, kind of at weird heights.
Oh, I'm not looking. What do you got? I
Oh, I'm not looking. What do you got? I
mean, I have cubes rendering on it where
mean, I have cubes rendering on it where
the dozers are. They're at weird
heights. See if I fix that.
There's probably they're probably not
There's probably they're probably not
aligned with the mesh as the thing,

right?
right?
No, they're for sure not because you're
No, they're for sure not because you're
just spawning it and then it's just

drawing itself at whatever dimension you

can make. Well, I think that it's the
can make. Well, I think that it's the
scale factor. Honestly,
I thought the scale factor is already a
I thought the scale factor is already a
part of the um Yeah, but there's like
part of the um Yeah, but there's like
the original function. The code came
the original function. The code came
with like this
weird. I mean, there are like things
weird. I mean, there are like things
here,
here,
but they're not lined up with the map at
but they're not lined up with the map at
all. So, the map's probably like drawn
all. So, the map's probably like drawn
weird
somehow. All right. Don't use that dozer
somehow. All right. Don't use that dozer
I sent you. What? Don't use the dozer I
I sent you. What? Don't use the dozer I
sent you. I'm in Blender and it came out
weird. The colors like
weird. The colors like
didn't sink
didn't sink
correctly. Let me see if I like the way
correctly. Let me see if I like the way
it looks.
Anyways, it's not a bad dozer. That's
Anyways, it's not a bad dozer. That's
actually a pretty solid
actually a pretty solid
dozer. Yeah, for some reason the colors
dozer. Yeah, for some reason the colors
didn't like actually work in
didn't like actually work in
Blender. There's like a file issue or
Blender. There's like a file issue or
something. Find a different one. That's
problems. There's a ton of them on Turbo
problems. There's a ton of them on Turbo
Squid. Yeah, there really are. Huh.
The ones that the low poly one is just
The ones that the low poly one is just
the free one, but there's obviously like
the free one, but there's obviously like
tons that are like 50 80 bucks or
tons that are like 50 80 bucks or
whatever. Yeah, I don't mind buying
whatever. Yeah, I don't mind buying
them, but like I don't know if there are
them, but like I don't know if there are
any of them that we like it's not good
any of them that we like it's not good
to do like the realistic ones cuz it'll

look weird when the rest of it doesn't

look the same.
like actually you kind of got the best
like actually you kind of got the best

Yeah. Well, let me try to screw with it
Yeah. Well, let me try to screw with it
in Blender because it's like not turning
in Blender because it's like not turning

Is this it? Okay. Bulldozer texture.
Okay. All right. There we go. This is
Okay. All right. There we go. This is
now. Now we're making things happen.
now. Now we're making things happen.
Yeah, we're making things
Yeah, we're making things
happen. Unfortunately, it's texture was
happen. Unfortunately, it's texture was
just like I don't know. There's an error
just like I don't know. There's an error
with it. So, I'm just coloring it
with it. So, I'm just coloring it
myself.
Do you need color codes?
Do you need color codes?
Um, if you want. I'm just kind of
Um, if you want. I'm just kind of
dragging on the color wheel right now.
dragging on the color wheel right now.
So, it's um this the the color intensity
So, it's um this the the color intensity
it's
it's
187. So like red is 187 0 0 and the sign
187. So like red is 187 0 0 and the sign
is 0 1871
is 0 1871
187 and then it'll match all the other
187 and then it'll match all the other
M's.
Well, I feel like it has to be yellow.
Well, I feel like it has to be yellow.
It does not have to be yellow.
It does not have to be yellow.
Sure it does. Okay, fine. You can make
Sure it does. Okay, fine. You can make
it You can make it freaking yellow for
it You can make it freaking yellow for
now. But it's getting the puffer
now. But it's getting the puffer
treatment.

All right. It's getting the puffer
All right. It's getting the puffer
treatment at some point.
It's going to get the Tron
aesthetic. Okay, there we go. Now I'm
aesthetic. Okay, there we go. Now I'm
actually looking at freaking hex codes
actually looking at freaking hex codes
and not just like screwing with random
and not just like screwing with random
things.
You said it's 187 0 0. Yeah, for red.
You said it's 187 0 0. Yeah, for red.
Well, not 0000. That's that's no
Well, not 0000. That's that's no
transpar. That's like full transparent
transpar. That's like full transparent
or whatever.
or whatever.
No, I mean that's fine. You just spent
No, I mean that's fine. You just spent
187 for the red. But And then do you
187 for the red. But And then do you
know what it is for the the buffer deal?
know what it is for the the buffer deal?
Yeah, it's 0 187 187.
Yeah, it's 0 187 187.
Oh yeah, that's what I
meant. Trying to figure out why this
meant. Trying to figure out why this
thing doesn't line up the way it
thing doesn't line up the way it
should. Feel like this looks brighter
than
whatever. I just copy paste and click on
whatever. I just copy paste and click on
everything. It's the same.
Oh, for sure. That did not help.
Damn. All right, this looks kind of
tight. If only I could get it to load on
tight. If only I could get it to load on
the right spot.
the right spot.
All
right. All
right, I'm dropping you dozer file.
right, I'm dropping you dozer file.
Okay, I'm going to upload
this. All right, there's your file in
this. All right, there's your file in
Discord chat.
Yeah, I just pushed to version. See if
Yeah, I just pushed to version. See if
you can figure out why the uh it doesn't
you can figure out why the uh it doesn't
line up to the terrain. I'll get this
line up to the terrain. I'll get this
dozer loaded in in the
meantime. I can't figure out why it

doesn't line up with the damn

What? No idea.
What? No idea.
I'll chat to you later.
Yeah, nice job with this pearl and
Yeah, nice job with this pearl and
noise. It looks
good. We'll deal with the checkered [ __ ]
later. Okay, let's load in this model.

Terraform. Just did that as well. I I'm
doing loading. I'm loading the model in
doing loading. I'm loading the model in
right now. Spencer, I'll get that
right now. Spencer, I'll get that
working. Just can you figure out why the
working. Just can you figure out why the
hell the uh the cube doesn't draw at the
hell the uh the cube doesn't draw at the
right position on the map?
Okay. Thank you.
Holy memory leak.
Holy memory leak.
Well, I haven't we haven't bothered
Well, I haven't we haven't bothered
freeing anything.

Okay, it doesn't matter at this stage.

Okay, I see tiny

cube. Do you want it to be tilted? No,
cube. Do you want it to be tilted? No,
it's just it just doesn't it's not
it's just it just doesn't it's not
drawing correctly. There are eight of
drawing correctly. There are eight of
them and they there eight of them
them and they there eight of them
randomly placed and they should all be

like level with the terrain wherever
like level with the terrain wherever
they are.
Well, that's what I mean when you're
Well, that's what I mean when you're
saying level. You're level generally
saying level. You're level generally
means like it's like if it's at a 45
means like it's like if it's at a 45
degree angle, the cube will also be at a
degree angle, the cube will also be at a
45 degree angle. Yeah, we can do angle
45 degree angle. Yeah, we can do angle
after it actually renders in the right

it's floating. They they're all floating
it's floating. They they're all floating
or underneath the map right now.
Okay.
loser.
Yo, we got
dozer. Missing a

there's something funky that's going on

All right. Well,
All right. Well,
whatever. There is a
dozer. Maybe I didn't export the whole

I highlighted the whole thing. So, we'll

see if that works. You sent me another

Bulldozer_v3. I think your location is

Yes, it should be.
Yes, it should be.
So, I'm going do that.
Get the freaking wheel on it
Get the freaking wheel on it
still. We'll figure that
still. We'll figure that
out. Got the height fix.
out. Got the height fix.
Not done.
Not done.
Gotcha. But you see the bug?
Well, I presume the bug is just that
Well, I presume the bug is just that
it's at the wrong height. Um because you
it's at the wrong height. Um because you
picked just random between zero and
picked just random between zero and
size. I
mean, what I need to check out is Okay,
mean, what I need to check out is Okay,
so how's the rendering of this going to
so how's the rendering of this going to
be? That's super weird.
Well, I guess X and Y could just be,
but they have mesh gun examples.
So, do you have a Z going on here?
So, do you have a Z going on here?
Right. Or what? Yeah, you have to. Okay.
Right. Or what? Yeah, you have to. Okay.
Be XZ, I think. So, Z's are a
thing. Trying to Okay. Well, let's just
thing. Trying to Okay. Well, let's just
see what happens with
this. Caleb is kind of really good.
Why is it? This height map
looks the source code. It doesn't show
looks the source code. It doesn't show
you the source code.
Wait, you don't have a Z parameter in
Wait, you don't have a Z parameter in
your dozer struct.
Well, you don't have a Z in your dozer.
Well, you don't have a Z in your dozer.
Well, the dozer doesn't need to know
it's The dozer is always on the flat
it's The dozer is always on the flat
ground, right?

It's like always just at the height of
It's like always just at the height of
the terrain at that All right.
Okay, I see what you're trying to
This is really weird that this isn't
This is really weird that this isn't
drawing correctly.
Yo, this is freaking cool.
Yo, this is freaking cool.
Whoa. What the hell? Yeah.
Yeah.
For some reason, cubes are still

thing. We can get rid of these dozer
glitches.
We RPR
it. We will accept this egg bolton PR.
I figure out if it's a my fault
IPR by the way. Yeah, I merged it. Oh,
IPR by the way. Yeah, I merged it. Oh,
okay. Well, I'm working on
okay. Well, I'm working on
uh camera.
Oh yeah, that actually they are
Oh yeah, that actually they are
correctly height mapped
correctly height mapped
now. Look at that. Boom.
Wait, how's yours not fault? I don't
Wait, how's yours not fault? I don't
know.
That pushed.
That pushed.
All right. Okay. Okay. So, now we got to
All right. Okay. Okay. So, now we got to
figure out why the dozers are
figure out why the dozers are
like not
dozing. Rand give you rand gives you

Why?
Why?
Rand percent a number is should

Sir, why did my Rail just decide to nuke
Sir, why did my Rail just decide to nuke
itself for no reason?
Did my GPU like nuke
itself? No, that doesn't make sense cuz

my monitor would have
shut. Yo, we have randomly moving
shut. Yo, we have randomly moving
dozers.
Dude, is that does it have the third
Dude, is that does it have the third
wheel again or no? Don't I I don't know
yet. How do you rotate the uh probably
yet. How do you rotate the uh probably
have this logic
have this logic
and power climb?
What are you trying to figure out? How
What are you trying to figure out? How
to rotate the
thing? Oh, it's scale, not
rotate. But you actually have to
rotate. But you actually have to
RL. You have this push matrix pop matrix
RL. You have this push matrix pop matrix

Yeah, I have to use that in a lot of the
Yeah, I have to use that in a lot of the
MS I've done.
Okay, I'm restarting my computer. I
Okay, I'm restarting my computer. I
don't know why my thing just like
Sometimes you just have to play with the
Sometimes you just have to play with the
right
dimension. You don't have a dozer Z.
dimension. You don't have a dozer Z.
It's dozer Y.
Hell. Oh, well that's not
it. Standing on it.
So it's
um what which what would it be also like
um what which what would it be also like
so you translate it to the
so you translate it to the
position and then you
position and then you
rotate probably don't need this one.
You don't need to double rotate for
You don't need to double rotate for
sure. Um, well, this is like Okay, so
sure. Um, well, this is like Okay, so
what would be helpful is you start with
Okay, find what your base thing is and
Okay, find what your base thing is and
then
then
apply the rotation and then apply the
apply the rotation and then apply the
rotation afterwards
rotation afterwards
again cuz like you need to make sure
again cuz like you need to make sure
that your your base model is rotated
that your your base model is rotated
correctly in the first place. Like is it
correctly in the first place. Like is it
upright? Is it whatever? It's pointing
upright? Is it whatever? It's pointing
this way. Yeah.
this way. Yeah.
So, is it is it correct? Well, it's
So, is it is it correct? Well, it's
pointing this way. I don't know what
the model should just be exported to
the model should just be exported to
point the correct way, right? Sometimes
point the correct way, right? Sometimes
it's weird.
And then I mean the main thing is it
And then I mean the main thing is it
should be I would
imagine
imagine
zero like a Y rotation maybe.
zero like a Y rotation maybe.
Um I did this in GPU drive. Let me just
Um I did this in GPU drive. Let me just
look at how I did
look at how I did
it because I rotate per a continuous
it because I rotate per a continuous
heading in
heading in
that. Oh, you have to do heading times
that. Oh, you have to do heading times
uh radians to degrees because it's
uh radians to degrees because it's
expecting degrees in ray.

Was it radians two degrees times? Yeah,
Was it radians two degrees times? Yeah,
it's it's heading and it's rad to de in
it's it's heading and it's rad to de in

all caps. Oh, wait. It's 90 plus heading
times.
Why are you doing 90? That's what was in
Why are you doing 90? That's what was in
your code. Okay. I don't know if it's in
your code. Okay. I don't know if it's in
degrees.
Look like they're turning.
No.
No.
RL rotate F.
What do you mean the negative 90? Is
What do you mean the negative 90? Is
that something I had prior? Yeah.
You're
You're
reading the not in degrees.
Oh, I guess maybe then that we don't
Oh, I guess maybe then that we don't
need this offset, but we would see it
need this offset, but we would see it
rotating either way.
This is just not rotating somehow. Well,
This is just not rotating somehow. Well,
if you took the the the 90 plus from
if you took the the the 90 plus from
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, you got rid of that.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, you got rid of that.
Okay,
Okay,
good. But that for sure is not rotating.
Isn't it? It should rotate around the Y
Isn't it? It should rotate around the Y
ais, I think.
If we're setting the
If we're setting the
heading, that's a good point.
We see some
We see some
numbers that are like in a reasonable
numbers that are like in a reasonable
range.
then this should like flip them at
then this should like flip them at
least,

them, isn't it? It's XYZ and then some
them, isn't it? It's XYZ and then some
other stuff, isn't it?
other stuff, isn't it?
or rotate F. The the heading the heading
or rotate F. The the heading the heading
should be the first parameter. Oh, okay.

And it should it should be heading and
And it should it should be heading and
then 001.
But wait, and one is the index or

I think one is just
like I actually don't know what one is,
like I actually don't know what one is,
but that's what I had before.
but that's what I had before.
Well, this is rotating the wrong axis.
Well, this is rotating the wrong axis.
See, I think I think the one is the axis
See, I think I think the one is the axis
of which it rotates on. Well, then it's
of which it rotates on. Well, then it's
the wrong one because it's it's tilting
the wrong one because it's it's tilting
it. Okay, then just make the one like
it. Okay, then just make the one like
the X the the first zero or the second
the X the the first zero or the second
zero, whichever one because you have to
zero, whichever one because you have to
rotate upon an axis and those are like
rotate upon an axis and those are like

Tim said this this is scale now.
Tim said this this is scale now.
I don't know.
I don't know.
No, no, no. You You're not rotating
No, no, no. You You're not rotating
anything if you have 00 Z. You have to

like Z one 0 one, it's one of those.
like Z one 0 one, it's one of those.
Yeah, there it is. It's a common there.
So it's like
Yeah.
Yeah.
All right. So I mean we'll see whether
All right. So I mean we'll see whether
this is like angled correctly, but
this is like angled correctly, but
um it's like that's it's we have Josers
um it's like that's it's we have Josers
driving around. There's a seg. Let's see
driving around. There's a seg. Let's see
where it
is. Uh right here. See him?
Okay, so there we go. That should be a
Okay, so there we go. That should be a
little more stable. I think we can start
little more stable. I think we can start
doing digging
things. I mean, we have dozers that

drive around Mars
now. I guess it would be a little bit
now. I guess it would be a little bit
more interesting to like If we did it
more interesting to like If we did it

How do we
um I guess we do dirt moving now, right?
I mean, I think first we probably want
I mean, I think first we probably want
to fix the direction it's facing. I
to fix the direction it's facing. I
mean, we could we could bother fixing

Um, how do we fix
Um, how do we fix

Okay. your V * cosine
You just want to take the dynamics I had

cuz arguably what you're doing right now
is you're rotating
and
then now mind you I don't think my
then now mind you I don't think my

physics was Honestly, probably that
correct, but at least you have move
correct, but at least you have move
expert in the C step by the way.
Yeah, I haven't gone back and fixed the
Yeah, I haven't gone back and fixed the
whatever it's called.
Um the re the resampling thing
yet. This dynamics thing
yet. This dynamics thing
And this dynamics thing, it makes sure
And this dynamics thing, it makes sure
that you turn at a
rate based on your speed.
Well, I think the problem is we have
Well, I think the problem is we have
some weird offset now, right? That's
some weird offset now, right? That's
like that's just going to make it even
like that's just going to make it even
harder for us to debug it. Like we
harder for us to debug it. Like we
should probably use this, but once we
should probably use this, but once we
like have it actually facing the right
like have it actually facing the right
way. No.
Okay, I hear you. Let me try and look
Okay, I hear you. Let me try and look
through it. on this as to why something
through it. on this as to why something
like that would be
wrong. It should
be is the camera
angled it should be facing like in the
angled it should be facing like in the
positive X direction. The base model

should be
You can test this by just setting
You can test this by just setting
heading to
heading to
zero, right?
zero, right?
Uh, okay.
Or it depends what you want your zero to
Or it depends what you want your zero to
be, I guess, cuz that's
Okay, it's 180 degrees off. It looks
Okay, it's 180 degrees off. It looks
like it's just
like it's just
backwards. They stopped gracefully. Oh,
nice. Are they rotating at all?
Hey, look at these
dozers. Let's see if it actually still
dozers. Let's see if it actually still
looks good once we uh add the driving
looks good once we uh add the driving
opponent back.
Now see, they get off centered
here. It's
minus. Yep, there it is. Got
minus. Yep, there it is. Got
it.
it.
Minus. Look at these. These look cool.
just driving all over.
just driving all over.
Actually, fairly smooth.
You may not even need to do the the
You may not even need to do the the
dynamics from the GPU drive stuff. This
dynamics from the GPU drive stuff. This
may just be like reasonable.
All right, I'm going to give you uh
All right, I'm going to give you uh
commit this up here. We are going to
commit this up here. We are going to
going to do the next thing, man.
daytime. Okay, there you go.
Let me use the restroom real quick. And
Let me use the restroom real quick. And
um yeah,
um yeah,
you're going to have to start thinking
you're going to have to start thinking
about digging, digging of things.
Hello.
Yo,
speaking time. Yeah.
So, how do we dig
We have to create the bucket. Yeah.
Well, we just have to
Well, we just have to
know where it is.
know where it is.
Um, so we have there's a bucket height,
Um, so we have there's a bucket height,
correct? There's a bucket height, bucket
correct? There's a bucket height, bucket
width, length.
width, length.
at bucket
V. But right now, this just lets you put
V. But right now, this just lets you put
the bucket up and put the bucket down.
So this can
be can take down a meter.
So now the bucket has a min and a max
So now the bucket has a min and a max
height.
height.
What do you think happens to the mesh
What do you think happens to the mesh
code when you start setting things to
code when you start setting things to
zero?
zero?
The mesh
The mesh
code? What do you mean?
code? What do you mean?
I guess in my mind I always thought I
I guess in my mind I always thought I
guess that we're just setting.
Are we just now going to lower the
Are we just now going to lower the
point? You think?
No. By a specific delta.
Okay.
So we do like
bucket
fine. This I guess is in cubic units.
fine. This I guess is in cubic units.
Let's say it can take one cubic meter.
Okay. So now what we have to do is
Okay. So now what we have to do is
basically we have to figure out the
basically we have to figure out the
intersection. So here's what I'm
intersection. So here's what I'm
thinking, right? We have to figure out
thinking, right? We have to figure out
the intersection of like where this
the intersection of like where this
bucket is. The bucket is just a thing
bucket is. The bucket is just a thing
that's stuck out in front of the dozer
that's stuck out in front of the dozer
and it's at some height. All right.
and it's at some height. All right.
Yeah. So then what we do is we figure
Yeah. So then what we do is we figure
out the difference between the height of
out the difference between the height of
the terrain there and the height of the
the terrain there and the height of the
bucket to figure out how much it
bucket to figure out how much it
scoops.
scoops.
Um or honestly we can just Yeah. I
Um or honestly we can just Yeah. I
think. Yeah, that's probably what we
think. Yeah, that's probably what we
should do is we should like Yeah. figure
should do is we should like Yeah. figure
out how much it scoops and then like
out how much it scoops and then like
decrease the height there and put it
decrease the height there and put it
into the bucket
into the bucket
capacity and then like if the bucket is
capacity and then like if the bucket is
angled down or whatever then instead it
angled down or whatever then instead it
drops dirt.
Do you want to hold off on the notion of
Do you want to hold off on the notion of
once the bucket is full it can't move
once the bucket is full it can't move
like keep getting dirt?
I mean it doesn't matter. Like what'll
I mean it doesn't matter. Like what'll
happen is it'll keep driving but it
happen is it'll keep driving but it
won't like cut any more dirt out which
won't like cut any more dirt out which
is like not fully accurate but it's not
is like not fully accurate but it's not
that bad.
Yeah. Yeah. Cuz we're not going to
Yeah. Yeah. Cuz we're not going to
handle like collision like impact of
handle like collision like impact of
terrain physics. We decided we're just
terrain physics. We decided we're just
going to subtract, right? Yeah. And
going to subtract, right? Yeah. And
literally once we get like the basics of
literally once we get like the basics of
this, we can already train like basics
this, we can already train like basics
of this and some mobs, we can already
of this and some mobs, we can already
train agents cuz like the reward
train agents cuz like the reward
function is super easy and we can just
function is super easy and we can just
like make the target map
like make the target map
flat, right? Um, you have to put you
flat, right? Um, you have to put you
can't do it flat because you have to put
can't do it flat because you have to put
um you have to put an area to be flat.
um you have to put an area to be flat.
You can't do the whole map flat.
You can't do the whole map flat.
Well, yeah. You're not going to be able
Well, yeah. You're not going to be able
to because the dirt isn't going to be
to because the dirt isn't going to be
the right amount. But like Yeah, you got
the right amount. But like Yeah, you got
to put dirt somewhere, right? Yeah, but
to put dirt somewhere, right? Yeah, but
we'll just give them a thousand steps to
we'll just give them a thousand steps to
make it as flat as they
can. They just get reward for matching
can. They just get reward for matching
the height map at specific points,
the height map at specific points,
right? Yeah. Yeah. No, I follow that.
right? Yeah. Yeah. No, I follow that.
Like I think we can honestly like we can
Like I think we can honestly like we can
probably have agents doing this within a
probably have agents doing this within a
couple of hours if we uh if we don't get
couple of hours if we uh if we don't get
too hung up on the logic for this little
too hung up on the logic for this little
bit.
bit.
Okay. Yeah. I mean the goal is kind of
Okay. Yeah. I mean the goal is kind of
just like get get something going and
just like get get something going and
then we can come back and argue about
then we can come back and argue about
like proper Oh yeah. handling of things
like proper Oh yeah. handling of things
later. Well, I think the first goal is
later. Well, I think the first goal is
to get something that's cool that like
to get something that's cool that like
looks like it's approximately doing the
looks like it's approximately doing the
right thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So yeah, now this is the the obnoxious
So yeah, now this is the the obnoxious
part.
part.
So we need to figure
out No, it can't be that bad cuz all
out No, it can't be that bad cuz all
it's just a bunch of offsets. Like you
it's just a bunch of offsets. Like you
you can set up a fixed offset of the
you can set up a fixed offset of the
shape of the bucket. Yeah. So but here's
shape of the bucket. Yeah. So but here's
the thing, right? So we have
the thing, right? So we have
look. All right. So we have
look. All right. So we have
just do it in we'll just do it
here. So like here's your
dozer and like it's at some angle. So
dozer and like it's at some angle. So
we're just modeling the bucket as like
we're just modeling the bucket as like
this this thing here. Okay. And then
this this thing here. Okay. And then
internally like there's a grid. You can
internally like there's a grid. You can
see that this blueprint paper has a
see that this blueprint paper has a
grid, right? So like what we want to do
grid, right? So like what we want to do
is we want to like iterate
is we want to like iterate
over these tiles here.
over these tiles here.
Okay. And then we can take dirt from
them. So how do we do this
portion? If this were axis aligned, it
portion? If this were axis aligned, it
would be really easy. So, it's just a
would be really easy. So, it's just a
rotation instead of it being axis
rotation instead of it being axis
aligned, right?
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?
So, like if this line if it if the if
So, like if this line if it if the if
the robot like if the dozer were just
the robot like if the dozer were just
like this, it would just be these cells,
like this, it would just be these cells,
right? We would literally just be able
right? We would literally just be able
to calculate super easy.
to calculate super easy.
It should just be the cells directly in
It should just be the cells directly in
front of it and then Yeah. So, how do we
front of it and then Yeah. So, how do we
calc the cells directly in front of it?
I mean, dum dum way is just
I mean, dum dum way is just
automatically subtract the current
automatically subtract the current
height by some fixed amount. No, it's
height by some fixed amount. No, it's
not the height. The height isn't the
not the height. The height isn't the
problem. The height is that the dozer is
problem. The height is that the dozer is
it's like at an angle,
it's like at an angle,
right? So, we need like how do we
right? So, we need like how do we
determine what cell is in front of it?
Well, that's a movement thing right now,
Well, that's a movement thing right now,
right? Because we have no Z, right? So
right? Because we have no Z, right? So
it's just like X. We're all just running
it's just like X. We're all just running
around in XY. So we have no angle of
around in XY. So we have no angle of
like No, but there's an angle on the 2D
like No, but there's an angle on the 2D
plane, right? So like these cubes are
plane, right? So like these cubes are
tiny or like they're small cubes, but
tiny or like they're small cubes, but
like there are like many cubes in front
like there are like many cubes in front
of the
of the
bulldozer. Like how do we iterate over
Can we just
like I don't know if we'll miss cubes
like I don't know if we'll miss cubes
and stuff doing this, but can we just
and stuff doing this, but can we just
like kind of hard to do like it's we
like kind of hard to do like it's we
need to do like the intersection of this
need to do like the intersection of this
line with the cube somehow.
The part that's tripping me out is
The part that's tripping me out is
like the map itself is still just like a
like the map itself is still just like a
2D array and then you have the height
2D array and then you have the height
map telling you where things technically
map telling you where things technically
are. But if you're saying we're now
are. But if you're saying we're now
adding like a particle component, this
adding like a particle component, this
has nothing to do with the height. The
has nothing to do with the height. The
problem here has nothing to do with the
problem here has nothing to do with the
height. So this grid like you see this
height. So this grid like you see this
is on blueprint paper, right? Yeah.
is on blueprint paper, right? Yeah.
Okay. Okay. So, you see that this the
Okay. Okay. So, you see that this the
bulldozer intersects with some grid
bulldozer intersects with some grid
cells.
cells.
Yes. How do we figure that intersection
Yes. How do we figure that intersection
out?
I just don't feel can't
I just don't feel can't
you you know because you it's just a
you you know because you it's just a
fixed number. Like I don't know what you
fixed number. Like I don't know what you
mean. like this. You you you'll know
mean. like this. You you you'll know
based off of the width and the length of
based off of the width and the length of
the bucket how many cells it's actively
the bucket how many cells it's actively
touching. Well, that's what we need to
touching. Well, that's what we need to
figure out. That's the math that we have
figure out. That's the math that we have
to figure out right now. Right.
It's some basic intersection
It's some basic intersection
calculation. I just don't know what it
calculation. I just don't know what it
is.
is.
Are you trying to do a line
Are you trying to do a line
intersection?
intersection?
It's either going to be a line or a
It's either going to be a line or a
rectangle, right?
just do two line intersections in the
just do two line intersections in the
front and the back or on all sides or
front and the back or on all sides or
whatever.
Um I would think well what's the easiest
Um I would think well what's the easiest
one to do? Is there is it an easier is
one to do? Is there is it an easier is
there like an easy formula for is this
there like an easy formula for is this
cube touching this line segment or is
cube touching this line segment or is
this cube touching like slash inside of
this cube touching like slash inside of
this rectangle? Like what's the easiest
this rectangle? Like what's the easiest
formula? U I use one in GPU drive. All
formula? U I use one in GPU drive. All
right.
I have a line intersection
thing. It's how I do
collisions. Check line intersection. You
collisions. Check line intersection. You
you're calculating
you're calculating
vectors and finding if they're parallel
vectors and finding if they're parallel
with each other. Yeah.
box generally has the easier formula.
Okay. So, it's the A. It is the
AAB. Oh, hold on. I need to mute you on
AAB. Oh, hold on. I need to mute you on
stream. All right. There we go.
So I think this is it right
So I think this is it right
here. Right.
here. Right.
Mhm. So this is this gives you the
Mhm. So this is this gives you the
points of uh the bucket. So this gives
you this gives you the cords of the
you this gives you the cords of the
bucket.
I mean this is literally just
I mean this is literally just
like this is a standard intersection
like this is a standard intersection
calculation. I just don't know what it
calculation. I just don't know what it
is.
is.
So this is giving you the min and the
So this is giving you the min and the
max. And then
Oh yeah. So all we have to do here right
is Okay. So I think this is not that
is Okay. So I think this is not that
bad.
Um, all right. So, we have the dozer X,
Um, all right. So, we have the dozer X,
the dozer Y.
the dozer Y.
Here we actually want to do this before
Here we actually want to do this before
anything. So, like the first thing we do
anything. So, like the first thing we do
is we
dig. So,
You're starting off by getting the
You're starting off by getting the
coordinates of the bucket. Yeah. Yeah.
coordinates of the bucket. Yeah. Yeah.
So,
So,
it's uh the X on the bucket min
it's uh the X on the bucket min
is So, it's dozer
X. Well, [ __ ] We have to go in front.
X. Well, [ __ ] We have to go in front.
It has to be in front of the heading,
It has to be in front of the heading,
right? So it's
right? So it's
like
like
bucket CX
bucket CX
equals Yeah, like that, right? Or and
equals Yeah, like that, right? Or and
it's dozer. I guess it's bucket offset.
Yeah, there should be a bucket
Yeah, there should be a bucket
offset meters.
Are you describing the offset of the
Are you describing the offset of the
bucket to be the the back of the bucket
bucket to be the the back of the bucket
or the front of the bucket? Uh center.
Okay. So then, okay. So you have this,
Okay. So then, okay. So you have this,
right? So this is your center and then
right? So this is your center and then
this is xmin is bucket
cx
cx
minus the bucket width and bucket
minus the bucket width and bucket
height, I guess.
height, I guess.
got
got
like fine bucket
width like 2 m or 2.5 m bucket length I
width like 2 m or 2.5 m bucket length I
don't
Yeah, it should be divided by
Yeah, it should be divided by
two because if you're using the center
point Oh, wait.
point Oh, wait.
Minus
plus my min is c y minus
plus my min is c y minus
this
plus. And we're going to have to like
plus. And we're going to have to like
draw all these things, I'm sure. Right.
draw all these things, I'm sure. Right.
Oh, for sure.
Oh, for sure.
Otherwise, we'll have no idea like where
Otherwise, we'll have no idea like where
the thing is.
the thing is.
Okay. So now we have so we get the
bucket bucket a
bucket bucket a
b and
then now we can just iterate from xmin
then now we can just iterate from xmin
xmax y min yax
xmax y min yax
right and then we have to do the test.
right and then we have to do the test.
Are you doing a just a big comparison to
Are you doing a just a big comparison to
make sure it's inside of the range?
make sure it's inside of the range?
Yeah. And also, this is not in the
Yeah. And also, this is not in the
correct units either because this width
correct units either because this width
now is in it's in like grid cell units
now is in it's in like grid cell units
or whatever. I think
I thought you just
I thought you just
[Music]
What is the base unit we're using for
What is the base unit we're using for
the
land? Are we calling it
uh the base unit? Yeah, we we haven't
uh the base unit? Yeah, we we haven't
like fixed it correctly. It's got to be
like fixed it correctly. It's got to be
like scaled.
Now we have to do we have to do the the
Now we have to do we have to do the the
check to see if it's in there.
You know what? Why don't we just like
You know what? Why don't we just like
This is kind of dumb. We should What we
This is kind of dumb. We should What we
should probably just do initially right
should probably just do initially right
here. We can get the bucket scoop
here. We can get the bucket scoop
aligned afterwards, right? Can't we just
aligned afterwards, right? Can't we just
like
Yeah. Okay. So, now we're just we have
Yeah. Okay. So, now we're just we have
the we have the thing that's in front of
the we have the thing that's in front of
the dozer and we're just going to take a
the dozer and we're just going to take a
chunk out of
there. So, like
Are you just going to subtract it? Yeah,
Are you just going to subtract it? Yeah,
I think so.
I think so.
I don't understand what's going on in
I don't understand what's going on in
this double for loop. Well, we need to
this double for loop. Well, we need to
go over all this. Like, so what I did
go over all this. Like, so what I did
here is I just I was lazy because I
here is I just I was lazy because I
don't know how to do this freaking map
don't know how to do this freaking map
initially. So I just did this. So here's
initially. So I just did this. So here's
your dozer. Here's your your dozer,
your dozer. Here's your your dozer,
right? So I just did this. All right.
right? So I just did this. All right.
This is what you're
scooping.
See? So I didn't tilt it.
That makes sense or no?
That makes sense or no?
Okay. So, you just
scooped a 4x4.
scooped a 4x4.
Uh, I think it's a 5x5, but yeah.
All
right. So now we have load and capacity
right. So now we have load and capacity
here.
Um now what do we do? We
do
Something like
Something like
this. Add the load.
Okay, that's kind of how we take terrain
Okay, that's kind of how we take terrain
out,
out,
right?
Basically, this is I feel like the
Basically, this is I feel like the
bucket height men delta math
is questionable.
is questionable.
is definitely questionable
is definitely questionable
cuz okay so you're you're taking in each
cuz okay so you're you're taking in each
of those cell points you're like okay at

you and I set aside some
you and I set aside some
time tomorrow just to like do some uh

client stuff? Absolutely.
Great. Cool. I uh I should be working on
Great. Cool. I uh I should be working on
the release, but I basically am burnt on
the release, but I basically am burnt on

today. Cool. Uh yeah,
today. Cool. Uh yeah,
I've I think we are close to
I've I think we are close to
uh fuller results on the client stuff
uh fuller results on the client stuff
for us.
for us.
Um and the LP is just not doing

Lovely. It works on the uh on the map.

It like does it do you still have the

So I have the thing where it where it
So I have the thing where it where it
wasn't full solve it helps on the older
wasn't full solve it helps on the older
version of the

both the code and the
both the code and the
hyperparameters it's breaking even.

So it's not hurting but it's not
So it's not hurting but it's not

I mean, it's possible that our base

I I think that is true,
I I think that is true,
which would make sense considering that
which would make sense considering that
we're kind of sodaing everything out of

Um, now I do think there are more ways
Um, now I do think there are more ways
to slice and dice the LPing that
to slice and dice the LPing that
eventually we might find a setting where
eventually we might find a setting where
it helps
it helps
and where that really brings down to

performance. But even now, like in the
performance. But even now, like in the
ways I've been doing it up till now,
ways I've been doing it up till now,
which is sort of messing with their
which is sort of messing with their
configs and all that kind of stuff and

like put creating situations that should

be harder. Um I am bringing down those
be harder. Um I am bringing down those
like heart max curves or those those
like heart max curves or those those

down uniformally.
So uh and then I was briefly chatting
So uh and then I was briefly chatting
with it's not that crazy like the thing
with it's not that crazy like the thing
is it's kind of like we have a sort of a

It's similar. Yes. But a little bit
It's similar. Yes. But a little bit

similar. Um but the other thing right is
these maps are big enough and complex
these maps are big enough and complex
enough that it's like it's it's almost
enough that it's like it's it's almost
like what you get with neural 3 where
like what you get with neural 3 where
well that's why I said it should be like
well that's why I said it should be like
you know you have a map that has like a
you know you have a map that has like a

map that has tons of objects in it. Like
if you scale on that there should be
if you scale on that there should be
some disparity.
some disparity.
Yeah. So, I did that scaling as well.
Yeah. So, I did that scaling as well.
And
And
uh having tons of objects made the game
uh having tons of objects made the game
really easy. Yes,
really easy. Yes,
that's expected. That's the easy
that's expected. That's the easy
setting. And then and then whenever you

go down to like single objects on

the curves are all getting to what I
the curves are all getting to what I
think is the max and it's all the curves
think is the max and it's all the curves

Oh, but is it actually solving like the
Oh, but is it actually solving like the
single because like you'd have to
single because like you'd have to
actually see the agents running around
actually see the agents running around
to go find the single resource converter
to go find the single resource converter
or
or
whatever they do that. Um, so I haven't
whatever they do that. Um, so I haven't
done any like I haven't taken a hard
done any like I haven't taken a hard
look at that like of the trained
look at that like of the trained

you should look at because the thing is
you should look at because the thing is
if they actually go like run around
if they actually go like run around
until they find the one converter on the
until they find the one converter on the
map or whatever and they do stuff then
map or whatever and they do stuff then
we just full solve their end. So like
we just full solve their end. So like
then it's like yeah guys you have to
then it's like yeah guys you have to
like add more stuff now. We full solved
like add more stuff now. We full solved
your problem. Yeah. It's like yeah we

have this other thing that probably
have this other thing that probably

Yeah.
Yeah.
Which is
Which is
fine. That's totally
fine. That's totally
fine. All
right,
right,
cool. We will uh we can do some stuff
cool. We will uh we can do some stuff
like either later tonight or probably
like either later tonight or probably
tomorrow. Sound good? Um let's say
tomorrow. Sound good? Um let's say
tomorrow I've got like the IRS mailed me
tomorrow I've got like the IRS mailed me
back my taxes.
back my taxes.
Okay.
Okay.
Uh why? I forgot to sign something. Ah,
Uh why? I forgot to sign something. Ah,
very fun. And so I just I need to take
very fun. And so I just I need to take
care of that because I want to mail that
care of that because I want to mail that
back out today. So just like there's
back out today. So just like there's
some stuff I want to take care of while
some stuff I want to take care of while
I'm out doing that and that's going to
I'm out doing that and that's going to
take me out for a decent chunk of the
take me out for a decent chunk of the
day. And you know that there's no
day. And you know that there's no
withholding on any of this stuff. So
withholding on any of this stuff. So
you're responsible for that. That's in
you're responsible for that. That's in
the docs, right? Oh yeah. Yeah. This is
the docs, right? Oh yeah. Yeah. This is
for last year's taxes. Not none of what
for last year's taxes. Not none of what
we've been doing will come in until next
we've been doing will come in until next

half of all of it in a separate account,
half of all of it in a separate account,
which is just going to be taxes.
which is just going to be taxes.
Yeah, there you go.
All right, cool. Thanks, Spencer. I
All right, cool. Thanks, Spencer. I

Terraforming time. Terraforming time.
Terraforming time. Terraforming time.
Later. Yep. later.
Later. Yep. later.
So, this is half of it, right? Like the
So, this is half of it, right? Like the
other half is the uh unloading.
I was still tripping about how you did
I was still tripping about how you did
this because like if that's now the map
this because like if that's now the map
height plus the thing is the bottom of
height plus the thing is the bottom of
the bucket and you're just subtracting
the bucket and you're just subtracting
the map height minus the thing you just
the map height minus the thing you just
subtracted from.
I don't know if I did it right. I just I
I don't know if I did it right. I just I
did
something cuz you effectively just did
something cuz you effectively just did
dozer bucket height minus bucket minus
Yeah, delta is just dozer bucket height.
Delta or rather negative dozer bucket
Delta or rather negative dozer bucket
height. Oh, what' I do? Uh delta is
delta is basically just negative dozer
delta is basically just negative dozer
bucket height with the current
bucket height with the current
math. You do map height minus map height
math. You do map height minus map height
minus dozer bucket height.
minus dozer bucket height.
Delta should just doer bucket height.
Yeah, it should literally just
Yeah, it should literally just
be uh dozer. That's just negative dozer
be uh dozer. That's just negative dozer
bucket
height. Okay.
height. Okay.
I'm not saying that's correct. I'm just
I'm not saying that's correct. I'm just
saying that's what you have right now.
saying that's what you have right now.
So if dozer bucket height is greater
So if dozer bucket height is greater
than
than
zero, this This
Oh, no, wait. It's literally just
Oh, no, wait. It's literally just
doesn't bucket always be greater than
doesn't bucket always be greater than
zero because it's literally just a fixed
zero because it's literally just a fixed
number of
Dang it. I No, I'm doing the math
Dang it. I No, I'm doing the math
totally wrong, but here it's supposed to
totally wrong, but here it's supposed to
be something
like I'm totally screwing this thing up.
like I'm totally screwing this thing up.
It should be map height minus bucket
It should be map height minus bucket
height,
right? For the for the actual delta for

the change in the map end map. I mean
the change in the map end map. I mean
here we can just do ifer bucket height
here we can just do ifer bucket height

one. You need to get a zapper, dude.
each of those

right. I think I killed it, but I don't

Um, you're not using CX or Oh, wait.
Um, you're not using CX or Oh, wait.
Never mind. Never

right. What about
this? We debug this and do something
this? We debug this and do something
with it
maybe. And

um we
do. So are you effectively saying

Uh yeah, we have to make this mesh thing
Uh yeah, we have to make this mesh thing
adjustable.
Well, isn't it created from or is that
Well, isn't it created from or is that
fixed to create one time? You see this
fixed to create one time? You see this
Malik here? It actually mal
So probably we need to
do well if you just get access to the
do well if you just get access to the
vertices
right like
This is going to return a copy. Don't
This is going to return a copy. Don't
want
a mesh from height
Something like this.
Yeah. And then every step you're
Yeah. And then every step you're
updating. Mhm.
updating. Mhm.
Yeah. Uh, okay. Bucket

Make sure we get good progress on this
Make sure we get good progress on this

man.
CX. This is bucket CX.
this right in Python. on.
what do we think about digging some? I
what do we think about digging some? I
think like this basic thing will work
think like this basic thing will work
and then we'll have to do there like
and then we'll have to do there like
several more things we have to do
several more things we have to do
obviously, but
obviously, but
um I at least want to see the terrain be
um I at least want to see the terrain be
adjustable.
And all these mesh like these have to
And all these mesh like these have to
all
be right.
There's so
many. I mean, like, I could bother to
many. I mean, like, I could bother to
like figure out how to do this
like figure out how to do this
programmatically, but like how often do
programmatically, but like how often do
I have to do this Really?
lies back from the dead.
and almost
and almost
done. So,
done. So,
um I don't know. We're going to have to
um I don't know. We're going to have to
get like the axis align version of it
get like the axis align version of it
obviously, but like we should pretty
obviously, but like we should pretty
quickly start to see like something that
quickly start to see like something that
actually looks like
um yeah, something that actually looks
um yeah, something that actually looks
like a digging sim. Pretty much as soon
like a digging sim. Pretty much as soon
as this code is correct.
Keep overflow.
What did I do wrong here? This obvious?
What did I do wrong here? This obvious?
Um, size of mesh should not be a
Um, size of mesh should not be a
pointer. It should just be size of mesh.
pointer. It should just be size of mesh.
Okay.
Okay.
Yep. And then this gives you a pointer
Yep. And then this gives you a pointer
to it
here. Maybe that'll
work. All right. Well, the mesh got
work. All right. Well, the mesh got
[ __ ] No.
Trying to reload an already loaded
mesh. Okay.
You want to load the mesh in the make
client.
client.
Um well this has to you need to call
Um well this has to you need to call
this to synchronize the data I believe.
What does upload mesh
do? I like I guess are you not allowed
do? I like I guess are you not allowed
to call this thing multiple times?
Okay. So, you're not allowed to recall
Okay. So, you're not allowed to recall
this apparently.
I only call it once.
Oh, what if you just call update height
Oh, what if you just call update height
map
map
mesh one time the beginning to see if it
mesh one time the beginning to see if it
it still works?
it still works?
This works.
Maybe you just take it, but it's very
Maybe you just take it, but it's very
slow.
slow.
But I think that this is
update.
You could give
You could give
it just the cells that you're updating.
it just the cells that you're updating.
Maybe you give it just the cells. It's
Maybe you give it just the cells. It's
not like there's something wrong with
not like there's something wrong with
it. It doesn't like that I'm calling
this trying to load reload an already
this trying to load reload an already
loaded mesh.
I uh I don't know how you're supposed to
I uh I don't know how you're supposed to
do this.
I don't think what we should do with
I don't think what we should do with
this.
Like we have to make a new mesh. Is that
Like we have to make a new mesh. Is that
what it is?
You think kill a mesh make a mesh every
You think kill a mesh make a mesh every
time? I don't freaking know, I guess.
time? I don't freaking know, I guess.
Let me
see. We Let's say that we put this
see. We Let's say that we put this
here. Mhm.
Okay, so this runs. It's like uploading
Okay, so this runs. It's like uploading
the mesh constantly. It
the mesh constantly. It
runs probably leaking
runs probably leaking
memory. That does run
memory. That does run
though. So, can we see if
though. So, can we see if
um I can't tell if anything is actually
um I can't tell if anything is actually
decreasing?
Maybe forcibly set all bucket height or
Maybe forcibly set all bucket height or
tilts to positive so that you know
tilts to positive so that you know
everything should
be dropping in height. I think we're
be dropping in height. I think we're
going to just do
um this
I think I got to go get my old chair.
I think I got to go get my old chair.
This This is freaking killing my neck
This This is freaking killing my neck
being like down this low. Hang on.
All
right.
Okay. So, where's our
Okay. So, where's our
uh where are our
uh where are our
dozers? Oh, they're underneath the map
dozers? Oh, they're underneath the map
cuz the map height is getting set to
cuz the map height is getting set to
zero.
zero.
Oh, cuz they're driving right on top of
Oh, cuz they're driving right on top of
the zero they just set. Oh, no. Wait,
the zero they just set. Oh, no. Wait,
they are. Look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This
they are. Look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This
is
editing. I definitely saw it editing.
editing. I definitely saw it editing.
Yeah.
I can't really
tell. Definitely is. Look.
It's definitely cutting it
down. The
down. The
canyons will make it super
obvious. Ultra powered dozer.
there.
See? See that?
See? See that?
I'm still behind a couple seconds. So,
I'm still behind a couple seconds. So,
just let me
just let me
see. Definitely doing it.
see. Definitely doing it.
I think it's making a cannon now. Canyon
I think it's making a cannon now. Canyon
now, right? Yeah. Look at this.
now, right? Yeah. Look at this.
Okay. Yeah, it is.
All right.
All right.
So, now we have to fix things.
Um, yeah, we got to fix some things.
Let's see if that's
Let's see if that's
errors. Should be stable now
errors. Should be stable now
maybe. Yeah, look at that. This
maybe. Yeah, look at that. This
cannoning.
That's totally making canyons, right?
That's totally making canyons, right?
Yeah, I think so.
Honestly, why don't we just
Honestly, why don't we just
like fix this thing up, add some OB
like fix this thing up, add some OB
spaces, and see if we can get it to
spaces, and see if we can get it to
flatten everything.
Yeah, that'd be a simple task.
Yeah, that'd be a simple task.
Leaking tons of memory.
Leaking tons of memory.
Oh, yeah. We haven't freed literally
Oh, yeah. We haven't freed literally
anything. Yeah. Well, the model is
anything. Yeah. Well, the model is
allocating, I think, every time. We have
allocating, I think, every time. We have
to figure out the mesh thing.
But anyways, let's get um let's get this
But anyways, let's get um let's get this
thing some OBS and actions and like
thing some OBS and actions and like
train some train some things, huh? Yeah,
train some train some things, huh? Yeah,
because it can be set to a just keep

should be fine enough to flatten the

whole world. Mhm.
We can just do like this is plus.0. I
We can just do like this is plus.0. I
mean, this is iterating over a 100
mean, this is iterating over a 100
tiles. This is probably too big, huh?
Well, this is where it's like a little
Well, this is where it's like a little
unclear to me about the map dimensions
unclear to me about the map dimensions
versus
like map dimension versus vehicle
like map dimension versus vehicle
dimension in the realm of the cell.
This is your reward tier.
This is your reward tier.
I guess arguably you could say a cell is
I guess arguably you could say a cell is
just one meter or whatever one unit of
just one meter or whatever one unit of
anything. Yeah, it can't be a meter cuz
anything. Yeah, it can't be a meter cuz
that's too big,
that's too big,
right? But
right? But
anyways, compute observations.
Um, just a window. Yeah, around itself.
Um, just a window. Yeah, around itself.
Maybe offset forward a little bit.
initially.
Yeah. I don't know. You want to make
Yeah. I don't know. You want to make
like 9 10 x 10
window.
Um, yeah, I think we do.
And then what's that? Uh the annoying
And then what's that? Uh the annoying
trick
This 111
on. Okay.
I guess you have to get current cell and
I guess you have to get current cell and
then index offset.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um I think we should just do
like that
maybe.
maybe.
Okay, that's
Okay, that's
it. Um,
it. Um,
and then we just do if pick
is x *
x. Wait, that makes no sense. That just
x. Wait, that makes no sense. That just
sets up a a thing around unless are you

trying to make the map really small.
trying to make the map really small.
What are you What's here? What?
What are you What's here? What?
In your compute observations.
In your compute observations.
Uh yeah, that's totally wrong.
Yeah, that makes no sense at all. Huh.
Yeah, that makes no sense at all. Huh.
Yeah, it should be based off of the
Yeah, it should be based off of the
agent X.
agent X.
Can we just get the like
Can we just get the like
just get just get the agent and then do
just get just get the agent and then do
agent X time M size plus Y. Agent
Y. It was so damn easy when I did it
Y. It was so damn easy when I did it
here. What the [ __ ]
What do I do
What do I do
here? Our offset
This is
This is
I times
That's it. Like it's all we need.
Where did you set vision?
Where did you set vision?
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah, that should
work. I want to get like an agent
work. I want to get like an agent
training
already. Okay. And we have to call this
already. Okay. And we have to call this
inc, right?
Yes. And reset. And
reset.
reset.
Cool. So now we
um did you give it rewards?
um did you give it rewards?
I
I
think this Yeah, I gave it rewards.
Um, I guess we have to make a config for

this thing.
You leave whatever defaults are
You leave whatever defaults are
in any of
this. Oh, we have to like rebuild as
this. Oh, we have to like rebuild as
well.
Uh yeah, for sure. And then you got to
Uh yeah, for sure. And then you got to
delete the thing and do the whole
thing. And then copy
thing. And then copy
the file from the build.
We don't have logs at all.
Terraform has

Oh no, I'm dumb.
Map size doesn't exist. I thought it's
Map size doesn't exist. I thought it's
just size.
Yeah, but I think you still have to copy
Yeah, but I think you still have to copy
the file over.
Okay. So, I don't know if it does
Okay. So, I don't know if it does
anything or not.
Why is it not um showing any SP like
Why is it not um showing any SP like
steps or anything? Cuz I don't know.
steps or anything? Cuz I don't know.
Something's
wrong. Uh we probably can't use back in
wrong. Uh we probably can't use back in
it because it's multi- aent.
That's probably it.
That's probably it.
Yo, I don't know why it doesn't give us
Yo, I don't know why it doesn't give us
an error when we do that.
You got to do the offset thing, right?
You got to do the offset thing, right?
Yes.
That's nice. So, we actually do get
Where's this thing like
hanging? Not here.
Are you stepping at all? I'm figuring
out. Okay, so this thing segs. Lovely.
We never freed
anything right
here. The pearl and
noise. Oh, I guess we didn't
pass. This is supposed to be map size.
I already had that.
I already had that.
What? That doesn't make any goddamn
What? That doesn't make any goddamn
sense at
all. This is Does this call a net? Does
all. This is Does this call a net? Does
this not get
called? I think we have to call a nit in

our binding, don't
we? Yeah, you
do. We normally have a Mayait inside the

binding
sea. Yeah, I should be
good. Oh, you're going to have to do all
good. Oh, you're going to have to do all
the whole thing
again. Where's the freaking path?
Super
annoying. Are you looking for the delete
annoying. Are you looking for the delete
build
build

This feels like Fter now.
Now I can't tell if it's just taking
Now I can't tell if it's just taking
forever or hanging or
what.
Okay. Oh, there we
Okay. Oh, there we
go. Okay. So,
uh, by with the serial back end without

GDB taking making everything take
GDB taking making everything take

It lowkey takes a while. Mhm.
I feel Well, this is just 168. This just

gave us 168 million steps all at
gave us 168 million steps all at

right? Uh, batch size
probably. M number m is 512.
Something's great with our batch size.
Okay, so it's spawning a massive

freaking number of total agents for some
reason. What's your

262144 on from numbum

I feel like it shouldn't though. Why
I feel like it shouldn't though. Why
would it be so bad?
would it be so bad?
It's generating like 512 512 x 512 pland
It's generating like 512 512 x 512 pland

freeing anything. So, we freed zero.
freeing anything. So, we freed zero.
Thanks,
Okay. So, I mean this was like doing
Okay. So, I mean this was like doing
something and then
whatever. It's stuck. There no freaking

like stuff should not be able to get

So, it's fast until we hit the parlor

noise.
It's crazy it takes that long though,
It's crazy it takes that long though,
right? That's what I'm saying.
right? That's what I'm saying.
I mean, I guess you are doing a for loop
I mean, I guess you are doing a for loop
through whatever 512 512 is 250,000 or
through whatever 512 512 is 250,000 or
whatever. It shouldn't be that much.
Would you say this is about as long as
Would you say this is about as long as
it takes neural MMO to
it takes neural MMO to
load? No, we uh we only have a couple of

Okay. What if you It's a hack because
Okay. What if you It's a hack because
you're already doing 512 agents, right?
you're already doing 512 agents, right?
And you're doing random on the start the

Why not just store the map, the initial
Why not just store the map, the initial
map, and then reset it? Use mem set to

reset back to the original.
do
that cuz you're already going to have 40
that cuz you're already going to have 40
96 random instances anyways.
like
this.
this.
Yeah, I think that should speed things
Yeah, I think that should speed things
up.
We're going to have even more memory
We're going to have even more memory
leaks,

though. That shouldn't leak anything.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
Okay. So, this now runs their
Okay. So, this now runs their
multipprocessing bug. Anyways,
multipprocessing bug. Anyways,
you're on serial.
you're on serial.
So, if I just do this, it should work as
So, if I just do this, it should work as
well.
well.
You just got to have change numbum
You just got to have change numbum
workers. I don't think I don't know if

you have enough workers. I don't know
you have enough workers. I don't know
what your default is too. Oh,
okay. It wasn't reporting any stats.
okay. It wasn't reporting any stats.
Well, we didn't log.
Well, we didn't log.
Oh, we haven't called ad log. That's
Oh, we haven't called ad log. That's
right.
We can do that on
um on here,
right? You can do like this,
right? You can do like this,
right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
But we need
But we need
um there needs to be like a reward or
um there needs to be like a reward or
something.
right
here. Okay, so this is
here. Okay, so this is
fine. We have end for
fine. We have end for
turns decent enough. Multipprocessing

got stuck at Yeah, something's [ __ ]
got stuck at Yeah, something's [ __ ]
which is weird. It should not It's not

You're going to have to copy the file

All
right. So,
is it going?
is it going?
Yeah, it's going.
Stats are going infinitely up.

Well, how how do we get this to work
Well, how how do we get this to work
with multipprocessing?
right back.
We'll see what the heck these bots
do, but then we should get this thing
do, but then we should get this thing
training faster.
Oh, it's going. Well, no. Actually, we

shouldn't have to set reset our logs.
what this is.
All right, I'm back. Did you figure out

Um, no.
What are you What are you doing? You

going to try and eval this or something?
Uh, I don't know if this is the right

It probably
is. Okay, I got to kill this fly because

it's like I'm getting like increasingly
it's like I'm getting like increasingly

So we have some [ __ ] in this end
apparently. Do we try to run the uh the

cool.
cool.
Um, it's not saying where it is, so I'm
Um, it's not saying where it is, so I'm
like hunting for
it. The the issue there's one issue that
it. The the issue there's one issue that
you'll have that you have already that's
you'll have that you have already that's
just uh plland noise is
just uh plland noise is
declared after it's called. So you have
declared after it's called. So you have
to put it before nit.
There's a what after you. So you know
There's a what after you. So you know
how we change pearl and noise to have
how we change pearl and noise to have
original map. Yeah, you have to put the
original map. Yeah, you have to put the
whole pearl and noise function defined
whole pearl and noise function defined
above a nit. Huh. Okay.
above a nit. Huh. Okay.
But there's still more errors
But there's still more errors
um that I'm trying to find where it is
um that I'm trying to find where it is
cuz for some reason the sanitizer is not

actually telling me

Cuz X and Y max size should be the size
Cuz X and Y max size should be the size

just be size because we use size
just be size because we use size
squared.
What?
What?
The size of the map is size times size,
The size of the map is size times size,
right? So the X and Y max coordinates

Okay. Max coordinate size minus one.
Why did greater than or equal to size?

Yeah. So, we still get this
unaligned fast
bin. God damn it.
All right, I put up a small PR for the
All right, I put up a small PR for the
free allocations and stuff.
free allocations and stuff.
Does it run yet?
No.
It has no issue
locally. Free invalid pointer.
Okay. So, no, this thing still is like
Okay. So, no, this thing still is like
consistently. It's not just model
consistently. It's not just model
dependent either.
Is it Did we forget something in
Is it Did we forget something in
binding?
Maybe I mean this we should we should
Maybe I mean this we should we should
totally have debug stuff for this. I
totally have debug stuff for this. I
mean maybe it's worth us trying to
mean maybe it's worth us trying to
figure out how we can get the full
figure out how we can get the full
traces out of the uh the end to
end. And this kind of just like real
stupid. All right.
Well, our binding isn't complicated. It
Well, our binding isn't complicated. It
should just be
like similar as the breakout one, which
like similar as the breakout one, which
is just unpacking [ __ ] and
is just unpacking [ __ ] and
initializing. Okay. I don't think it's
initializing. Okay. I don't think it's
the binding.
All
right, let me see if I can Yeah, I got
right, let me see if I can Yeah, I got
the thing merged, but like
doing something dumb in
terraform. I'm keep checking the source.
terraform. I'm keep checking the source.
I'm going to try like getting some debug
I'm going to try like getting some debug
tools going.
Okay. So, we have I have a a trace that
Okay. So, we have I have a a trace that
I don't know if this is a correct
I don't know if this is a correct

where is it saying it explodes? I have
where is it saying it explodes? I have
something in just like end like in my
something in just like end like in my

and
find doesn't make sense.
I'm trying to figure out if I can
I'm trying to figure out if I can
finally get debug symbols compiled. I
finally get debug symbols compiled. I
have a possible idea. Uhhuh.
Um, our map values are floats, right?
Um, our map values are floats, right?
Yeah. But we're passing a float into

observations. And observations is a

I don't know if it does automatically.
I don't know if it does automatically.
Oh, see if you can uh I thought it
would. You can uh check. What is puffer

works. We train it up to like I don't

know what some of our smaller ends two

Oh 6887 7.41 is outside the range of

Okay. So like divide and cast. I just

don't Oh, we didn't norms. I guess we

did no normalization.
did no normalization.
You would divide it to like be within

Do you know what the range of values

No. Okay.
No. Okay.
I'll just stick this freaking here and
I'll just stick this freaking here and
here and here and we're going to just

see. I don't know where this R
see. I don't know where this R
goes. Thought it was a link ar, but it
goes. Thought it was a link ar, but it
doesn't make any
sense. What I'm trying to do is I'm
sense. What I'm trying to do is I'm
trying to compile this thing with debug
trying to compile this thing with debug
symbols so that we can actually like get
symbols so that we can actually like get
a proper trace into the C with this
a proper trace into the C with this
thing cuz like normally we can but what
thing cuz like normally we can but what
happens is that in the process of

building a Python extension somehow uh
building a Python extension somehow uh
setup tools like bullshits it.

Can I just make Do you have any issue

with me making OBS a float?
with me making OBS a float?
You can
try. Ideally, we wouldn't have to

because it makes it substantially
slower.
thought I saw me leak.
Yeah, we get we totally have extra link
Yeah, we get we totally have extra link

quarks? Yeah, we totally have this in
here. All right. Well, this is weird.

It's like when I'm running the local
It's like when I'm running the local

sometimes it doesn't.
sometimes it doesn't.
Uh, that's
weird. That's definitely not what we

want. Well, if it shows a leak

Doesn't give me any like lines to work
Doesn't give me any like lines to work
with.
What?
That is so weird. Why is it like that?
That is so weird. Why is it like that?
Okay.
I'm still trying to get us full
traces. If we could just get a trace,
traces. If we could just get a trace,
this would be easy.
or just
would say this just doesn't run which is
would say this just doesn't run which is
ridiculous.
ridiculous.
Why do why does it say I have 10
Why do why does it say I have 10
trillion leaks? Why does
this things have been free?
I don't know why.
I don't know why.
Um, like this thing just doesn't run
Um, like this thing just doesn't run
when I I uh try to load lease.
So, this is apparently the
So, this is apparently the
correct thing to preload.
So this is supposed to work but in our
So this is supposed to work but in our
case it just
case it just
breaks. Hang on.

Maybe maybe if I run without PDB Okay.
I mean this like is erroring in PyTorch
I mean this like is erroring in PyTorch
which is not what we
I wonder if I can do
Maybe I can do Um,
No, I'm not building the torch extension
No, I'm not building the torch extension
with the uh the wrong
with the uh the wrong
arcs. It's still getting stuck like at a
arcs. It's still getting stuck like at a
weird spot.
I got it, I think.
I got it, I think.
Hang on.
Ah, yo, I found it.
Ah, yo, I found it.
What was it?
What was it?
It's um a bad mess set in uh C
reset. And let me show you the command
reset. And let me show you the command
that I had to run to get this to [ __ ]
that I had to run to get this to [ __ ]
work.
Yeah, it works
now. Okay. So,
now. Okay. So,
uh, did you push your stuff?
uh, did you push your stuff?
No. Okay, push your stuff. I found the
No. Okay, push your stuff. I found the
bug and I importantly I we're never

going to have this problem again.
Let me give you the command. Wait, I
Let me give you the command. Wait, I
think I did push my stuff already to
think I did push my stuff already to

This is how I had to run it.
This is how I had to run it.
Did you put that in chat or something?
Did you put that in chat or something?
Or did you Yeah.
I also had to compile with debug. I'm
I also had to compile with debug. I'm
going to push my
going to push my

guess. Like literally, this wasn't even
guess. Like literally, this wasn't even
C being hard or anything. This was just
C being hard or anything. This was just
straight up the Python binds [ __ ]
straight up the Python binds [ __ ]
like not giving us error
messages. All
right. So now we have it.
Yeah. So we should be
good. I think so.
So now I
hopefully I can do it the fast version.
I still think the ops floats thing is
I still think the ops floats thing is
still possibly an issue. But what are
still possibly an issue. But what are
coding, bro? We are coding a digging

was just a bad mem set on OBS.
It doesn't like M size times M size.
It doesn't like M size times M size.
That's not how big OBS are.
Oh, yeah. You're right. Good c good
Oh, yeah. You're right. Good c good
catch. Well, I didn't catch it is the

thing. I got a stack trace.
Okay. Okay. And that's what this new
Okay. Okay. And that's what this new
command is. You have to rebuild with um
command is. You have to rebuild with um
LD like the whatever.
Dude, this is a long command. Holy.
Dude, this is a long command. Holy.
Yeah, I it took some uh some
figuring. Okay, so here we go. Here are
figuring. Okay, so here we go. Here are
dozers. All right, they're
dozers. All right, they're
dozing. Now we can rerun
training. Maybe we can actually run
training. Maybe we can actually run
training correctly.
I still have some weird [ __ ] where it's
I still have some weird [ __ ] where it's
uh like spawning two instances of render
uh like spawning two instances of render
for some reason at the start as well. I
for some reason at the start as well. I
don't know what's up with that.
Not quite sure how that's happening.
See if it still just hangs.
Did you get the multiprocessing thing to
Did you get the multiprocessing thing to
work now? Uh, I don't know. I'm running
work now? Uh, I don't know. I'm running
it. It doesn't seem to be doing stuff
it. It doesn't seem to be doing stuff
yet,
yet,
but Oh.
Okay. Yeah. So, now it
Okay. Yeah. So, now it
goes. It takes a heck of a
goes. It takes a heck of a
while. Now we're at uh almost a million
SPS. So we'll see if this gives us
SPS. So we'll see if this gives us
anything different, I
guess. It also should not just be going
guess. It also should not just be going
up and up and up, I don't think.
up and up and up, I don't think.
Right. Uh
Right. Uh
Why wouldn't it just go up and up and up
Why wouldn't it just go up and up and up
and up and up? It's getting rewarded
and up and up? It's getting rewarded
every time it basically moves.
every time it basically moves.
Okay, then we should actually see it
Okay, then we should actually see it
consistently like doing better.
It should be. Yeah, it should just go up
It should be. Yeah, it should just go up
until there's nothing left to
flatten. Assuming it actually trains.
flatten. Assuming it actually trains.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, we also have to
like this is very silly, but
um can't pass these from the CLI at the
um can't pass these from the CLI at the

this like it passes everything as
this like it passes everything as
strings.
Okay. So, they're just going in a
Okay. So, they're just going in a
circle,
man. So, yeah, they're just going in a

circle. Is that because it's resetting?
No, cuz they have 512 steps to collect

going up if that's all they're doing,
going up if that's all they're doing,
right? So something's
[Music]
weird. My guess may be the height map
weird. My guess may be the height map
updating. No, it's a render thing. Uh I
updating. No, it's a render thing. Uh I
just set it
just set it
to Oh, wait. This is Hang on. There's no
to Oh, wait. This is Hang on. There's no
check.
Oh, if if map height's not zero. Yeah.
Yep. That would that would be an issue.
Yep. That would that would be an issue.
All right, let's see uh if we can
All right, let's see uh if we can
recompile and actually get it to do
recompile and actually get it to do
something.
something.
I think this is going to look like
I think this is going to look like
really cool as soon as we, you know, get
really cool as soon as we, you know, get
it to do a thing. Can you figure out the
it to do a thing. Can you figure out the
um the memory leak on meshes so that we
um the memory leak on meshes so that we
can actually render without oming?
Um I'm currently trying to hunt down
Um I'm currently trying to hunt down
these like render memory leaks. Oh,
these like render memory leaks. Oh,
okay. So, you're doing it right.
So far to no avail, but I'm attempting
Well, we shall train Terraform.
It's saying they're saying that there's
It's saying they're saying that there's
so many leaks that I just don't even It
so many leaks that I just don't even It
has to all be coming from the mesh, I
has to all be coming from the mesh, I
guess, because

everything else is freed some way
everything else is freed some way
somehow.
somehow.
Okay, I'll be right back.
All
right. I've been trained and now the
right. I've been trained and now the
agents are training.
do
this. Nope, that didn't do anything.
this. Nope, that didn't do anything.
Great.
Well, this is a more
Well, this is a more
reasonable. It's still going up very
reasonable. It's still going up very
much.
I would have thought that the max reward
I would have thought that the max reward
should be like 600.
The size of the map
512. Why? Just like if they're always
512. Why? Just like if they're always
gathering like 1.2 a step max.
We got to make this.
Okay, they
uh they're now
uh they're now
like driving around doing things kind
of. Yeah, memory leak is big though.
I have to kill it before.
I have to kill it before.
But like they're driving
around like it's definitely a different
around like it's definitely a different
learned behavior and it looks
semicoherent. So, as soon as we can like
semicoherent. So, as soon as we can like
actually do this thing, like we can
actually do this thing, like we can
probably probably get some policies and
probably probably get some policies and
then it's like fine-tuning, you know,
then it's like fine-tuning, you know,
it's a loop of fine-tuning mechanics and
it's a loop of fine-tuning mechanics and
training agents,
right? That could be pretty
right? That could be pretty
legit. This could actually be pretty
legit. This could actually be pretty
damn good.
And I was really hope that was the thing
And I was really hope that was the thing
I fixed.
Let's see if I help you. Have you found
Let's see if I help you. Have you found
anything out with
anything out with
uh meshes mesh free whatever yet or no?
I'm pretty confident it's because we're
I'm pretty confident it's because we're
creating the height map mesh every
creating the height map mesh every
render step. Yes. But how do we free it?
render step. Yes. But how do we free it?
I'm having a hard time figuring out
I'm having a hard time figuring out
because even if I try and free the
because even if I try and free the
things inside of the mesh, it's like not

We'll try running locally on the thing.

I think we're going to be uh
I think we're going to be uh

Well, one thing for sure I think is
Well, one thing for sure I think is
probably wrong
is line 475 and each render step you're
is line 475 and each render step you're
making another client what
making another client what
if if it's the client is null so you're
if if it's the client is null so you're
doing it one time I guess but I feel
doing it one time I guess but I feel
like shouldn't that be done in make
like shouldn't that be done in make
client no that's the new that's the new
client no that's the new that's the new
endbind thing because we client gets

made when you call render
Now let's see if we have
Now let's see if we have
um graphs.
Well, possibly Not the most useful of

Uh, number go up. Mhm.
Uh, number go up. Mhm.
How I want to see if it curves.
If me percentage is low on on HTOP, does

It should not be a straight line

going to try this

just like getting rewards constantly and
just like getting rewards constantly and
then it was just like it kept it just

though. Boom.
Okay, now we should get a Neptune run
Okay, now we should get a Neptune run
that actually does something and we will
that actually does something and we will
see whether curve go

If you're doing that on the C side, like
If you're doing that on the C side, like
locally rendering, you just call render

And I guess you don't need to call close

client because that would be handled
client because that would be handled
inside as well.

Uh, I think you still you still probably
Uh, I think you still you still probably
need to do
that. Oh yeah, that's a totally
that. Oh yeah, that's a totally
different curve.
See, now it's super low.
Is it still training right now? Mhm.
We probably need to look at
We probably need to look at
observations. We probably need to do
observations. We probably need to do
lots of stuff.
Definitely.
Yeah. Okay, I think it's time for
Yeah. Okay, I think it's time for
observation debugging. Let me push these
observation debugging. Let me push these
fixes for you. Now we actually have
logging. All
logging. All
right. There the fix is pushed and uh
right. There the fix is pushed and uh
yeah this train curve no wonder we uh
yeah this train curve no wonder we uh
are not seeing anything too amazing out
are not seeing anything too amazing out
of
Okay, so this is our end. Uh, camera
Okay, so this is our end. Uh, camera
needs to be fixed and centered. Yeah,
needs to be fixed and centered. Yeah,
this is what the bots do.
Sorry, can you show that again? What the
Sorry, can you show that again? What the
bots are doing?
Um, oh, is the Twitch stream being

weird? Hold
up. All right, I can see again
now. Camera needs to be adjusted,
but I mean, they're moving
but I mean, they're moving
around. We fix Kim.

Um,
We need to find the center point of the

Okay,
Okay,
cool. It's decent.
I don't like the
um Shouldn't the target
be? Camera position could be higher up.

I think.
How do we fix this clipping plane

Um, cool. Uh, I will start on
Um, cool. Uh, I will start on
observations. See what's going on in
observations. See what's going on in
there.
I feel fairly confident the obs issue is
I feel fairly confident the obs issue is
going to be the float to char
going to be the float to char
thing. Could be.
I think it's the data scale.
Now you're just going to divide it by
Now you're just going to divide it by
the
the

size. M size times M size or not M size.
But yeah, M size. Uh no, just divide by
But yeah, M size. Uh no, just divide by
M size.
M size.
Why is it by M size? It's the height.
Why is it by M size? It's the height.
It's the

that. Okay.
So do this.
Perspective matrix.
What was the stream super far
What was the stream super far
behind? Probably comment on the camera
behind? Probably comment on the camera
stuff I was doing. Well, I don't know
stuff I was doing. Well, I don't know
why the YouTube stream would be super
why the YouTube stream would be super
far
behind. That's kind of weird.
now. Graphics is
fine. Oh, this needs to get reshaped,
fine. Oh, this needs to get reshaped,
doesn't it?
Why is there comp

what it's not like making the right

Oh yeah.
Don't know why it has a com 3D in there,
Don't know why it has a com 3D in there,

Okay, so this now works.
This needs to be

Okay, so this
runs. I feel like you did that actor

function very differently than how I did
function very differently than how I did
the GPU drive one. I'm just behind

will
say here is our latest creation.
Oh, I don't know if that's significant
Oh, I don't know if that's significant
yet.
Not
really. So,
really. So,
uh, you think it's getting reward shown
uh, you think it's getting reward shown
correctly
or is it capped out now?
or is it capped out now?
I'm still waiting to see, but I think it
I'm still waiting to see, but I think it
is. I think it's just stuck somewhere
is. I think it's just stuck somewhere
between like 50 and 60.
Do you think that's reasonable

the that we gave it? No idea.
It could be only gave it what 5 12 time

It could be.
It could be.
And what's the maximum amount of reward
And what's the maximum amount of reward
you can get per step?
you can get per step?
Well, technically 1.2, but that would
Well, technically 1.2, but that would
require you to be like your whole digger
require you to be like your whole digger
would have to be like 1.21. You'd have
would have to be like 1.21. You'd have
to have the whole digger on new soil.
How about value loss? Do we have a
Okay. So, I guess next we
Okay. So, I guess next we
like do we like do some sanity thing? Do
like do we like do some sanity thing? Do
we like sparsify the map or something?
Like what do you mean by sparify the
Like what do you mean by sparify the
map?
Like here we can
do randomly set portions to
do randomly set portions to
zero. Hang on.
Okay, this is obviously not what we
Okay, this is obviously not what we
want. What was the Do you know what the
want. What was the Do you know what the
like
scale? Trying to figure out like how big

the map
is. Okay, this is

something still not
something still not
like flaps.
Can you tell if there are flat bits
Can you tell if there are flat bits
here? Oh, no, there are. Right. Um, it
here? Oh, no, there are. Right. Um, it
looks like there's a little bit of hills
looks like there's a little bit of hills
somewhere.
somewhere.
Kind of hard to
Kind of hard to
see with the way that this texture is,
see with the way that this texture is,
right?
right?
Yeah. I mean, if you want, you can draw
Yeah. I mean, if you want, you can draw
something on the render again and if
something on the render again and if
it's equal to zero, make it like, I
it's equal to zero, make it like, I
don't know, draw a cube there or
don't know, draw a cube there or
something.
We can do like this. Leave the
mountains. Okay. So now we can see it,
mountains. Okay. So now we can see it,
right? This is like sparse
mountains. What we think about
mountains. What we think about
this? Let's give it a second. Like
this? Let's give it a second. Like
catching up visually on stream.
catching up visually on stream.
We give it like something like this.
Yeah. I mean, that has like pretty clear
Yeah. I mean, that has like pretty clear
targets, right? Yep.
We also need like new textures for this
thing. Oops. I just saw the the script I
thing. Oops. I just saw the the script I
was looking for.
Okay, now we can train
again. I'm going to give you these
again. I'm going to give you these
changes as well.
Okay, I pushed these for you. I'll be
Okay, I pushed these for you. I'll be
back. Need the restroom and uh flip the
back. Need the restroom and uh flip the
thing and I'll be right back.
All right. Well, we have um a new
graph, huh?
Spencer, how's this graph?
Spencer, how's this graph?
It doesn't look good, right?
No, that does not look good.
No, that does not look good.
It doesn't look like they're like
It doesn't look like they're like
getting better
at like seeking out the
at like seeking out the
uh the stuff, right?
Oops.
Yeah. So, they're just like going around
Yeah. So, they're just like going around
and like not
and like not
really bothering to like seek out new
terrain. So, uh let's see. Are they like
they're kind of still just going in
they're kind of still just going in
circles?
Let's see what they're getting. So, they
Let's see what they're getting. So, they
get this
get this
reward and rewards of I get it's set
reward and rewards of I get it's set
to plus
0.01F. We can make
0.01F. We can make
sure like
sure like
16 times real quick.
I mean, this has some rewards,
right? These are like reasonable
right? These are like reasonable
rewards.
Yeah, I mean it's getting some. Not like
Yeah, I mean it's getting some. Not like
it's like it shouldn't be getting it
it's like it shouldn't be getting it
every single time. Well, it shouldn't
every single time. Well, it shouldn't
be, right? That's the map across all the
be, right? That's the map across all the
steps, right? Was it across all the
steps, right? Was it across all the
agents of one step? All agents of one
agents of one step? All agents of one
step. Okay. So, it's like possible.
So we have like this looks good.
Um is there possible that it's like
Um is there possible that it's like
there's some jank thing with
there's some jank thing with
multidiscreet?
Well, you did the multi-discreet action
Well, you did the multi-discreet action
different than I did in GPU drive. How'd
different than I did in GPU drive. How'd
you do it?
you do it?
Um,
it was summing the
it was summing the
actions. summing the actions
and all. Where is
this? This was the actor.
Let me put it in the
Let me put it in the
chat. That was my
chat. That was my
uh actor in the torch.pie.
Oh, I don't know if that really makes a
Oh, I don't know if that really makes a
difference,
but I actually don't
but I actually don't
know how I have it at the moment.
What did you do? And do you split it?
What did you do? And do you split it?
Let's see.
Split.
I do split. Yes, I split.
That's probably faster to be fair.
It just is like totally
stuck. Unless we also just look at our
data. We also just have not tried
data. We also just have not tried
hybrids at all.
You think the vision window is too
You think the vision window is too
small?
small?
I don't think so. It's But like So
I don't think so. It's But like So
there's some data there,
there's some data there,
right? That looks like it sees a little
right? That looks like it sees a little
bit of stuff.
Um.
Oh, I have an idea. Mhm. It doesn't know
Oh, I have an idea. Mhm. It doesn't know
where it is.
where it is.
It's in the center of its window.
Uh, unless maybe it's not. Did we not
Uh, unless maybe it's not. Did we not
center the window correctly?
if that would totally screw it up if
if that would totally screw it up if
it's like the wrong window.
it's like the wrong window.
I just know that when I did stuff in
I just know that when I did stuff in
tower climb,
tower climb,
uh, what did I
uh, what did I
do? I'm pretty
do? I'm pretty
sure is this x comma y? Do we have
sure is this x comma y? Do we have
something flipped?
I think it may be the y is you're
I think it may be the y is you're
supposed to
supposed to
multiply y offset plus y * size plus x
multiply y offset plus y * size plus x
offset plus x. We did x comma y format
offset plus x. We did x comma y format
though, which is like why I'm confused.
Yeah, it's Y time size.
Yeah, it's Y time size.
Did you drew Did you try something?
Did you drew Did you try something?
No, I just went to go look at render and
No, I just went to go look at render and
and look at how we drew the dozers.
Well, I'm confused though because we
Well, I'm confused though because we
have the data is stored in X, Y, isn't
have the data is stored in X, Y, isn't
it? Or are we backwards?
it? Or are we backwards?
The data
The data
is what do you mean just one big array?
Um, and we do our index tricks to get
Um, and we do our index tricks to get
the right
the right
I mean how do we index it? Do we index
I mean how do we index it? Do we index
it like
No, you just do y offset plus y times m
No, you just do y offset plus y times m

size. You know what? I'll try it. Let's
see.
I think it's lay reversed.
I think it's lay reversed.
And then this one also.
And then this one also.
Which one? This X and this Y or no? The
Which one? This X and this Y or no? The
one in compute all observations. But and
one in compute all observations. But and
then
also doing that. I need to look at tower
also doing that. I need to look at tower
climb to find out what the right way of
climb to find out what the right way of
doing that
is. We can even leave it on the the fast
is. We can even leave it on the the fast
version.
The OBS
The OBS
idx should
Yeah, this looks like totally random.
if it's still doing
that. All right, I retract my statement.
that. All right, I retract my statement.
I'm wrong.
I'm wrong.
You can put it back to X time size and Y
You can put it back to X time size and Y
times Yeah.
So,
So,
like I mean something's wrong. I'm
like I mean something's wrong. I'm
pretty sure it can't
see like if I just comment the OBS out,
see like if I just comment the OBS out,
what
happens? Yeah. So, it can't see at all,
happens? Yeah. So, it can't see at all,
man.
man.
It's like the same result with the obs
It's like the same result with the obs
commented out
completely. Okay.
I'm going to try my float thing now.
seems totally fine to me.
They are driving around.
Uh, one way we can check things is we
Uh, one way we can check things is we
could draw a line. Mhm.
To the height it
To the height it
thinks things are
at. Maybe we can draw like around it, I
at. Maybe we can draw like around it, I
guess.
Can we do like like kind of like how I
Can we do like like kind of like how I
do the lasers on GPU drive?
You need to put that inside of
You need to put that inside of
the matrix, I think.
Oh, but then
Oh, but then
um then we won't get to check to see if
um then we won't get to check to see if
it's actually
like Oh, you're doing it this way. Okay,
like Oh, you're doing it this way. Okay,
it's
fine. I thought you were testing
fine. I thought you were testing
something else.
Perfect. Why is it
tilted? The
hell? Hang on.
Okay, so this is how far they think they
Okay, so this is how far they think they
can see.
Do the vision windows make sense or are
Do the vision windows make sense or are
they too tiny? They could just be tiny.
It looks like it has no way of seeing
It looks like it has no way of seeing
anything.
anything.
Well, the the vehicles are nowhere near
Well, the the vehicles are nowhere near
this big as the thing, right?
this big as the thing, right?
Like how big is this vehicle in units?
Um I think
one right can't be. Did we scale it?
Think we ever I think it just I think it
Think we ever I think it just I think it
just add its own position. I don't think
just add its own position. I don't think
we have like a size on it.
Okay. So, like that's
Whoa. This is
wrong. Quarter size
wrong. Quarter size
dozer. All right. So, there we go. So,
dozer. All right. So, there we go. So,
this is like
this is like
They're in the center of this little
They're in the center of this little
thing
now. Well, actually, maybe the dozers
now. Well, actually, maybe the dozers
are supposed to
be. I mean, this is probably very tough.
be. I mean, this is probably very tough.
Right. I think they can't see anything.
Right. I think they can't see anything.
All right. Blue
shell. Well, it's better if they can go
fast. You think this does anything?
their speed so they can explore faster.
Mhm. If not, the other thing we can do
Mhm. If not, the other thing we can do
is we can dilate the ops. I was planning
is we can dilate the ops. I was planning
on doing that
on doing that
anyways. You know what I mean?
anyways. You know what I mean?
No, I don't know what dilating off
No, I don't know what dilating off
means. All right, I'll show you. It's a
means. All right, I'll show you. It's a
cool trick.
Cuz like you don't want to make the
Cuz like you don't want to make the
window huge, right?
Ideally. Yeah.
I don't think you can
see. So like
Okay.
I think this is
it. Let's see if it Let's see what this
it. Let's see if it Let's see what this
looks like if I do it here.
Wait, is it just allowing it to have
Wait, is it just allowing it to have
gaps and go a little look further? Yep.
gaps and go a little look further? Yep.
Oh, that's kind of cool.
That's a really clever thought. Yeah.
Okay. So now you see this, you see the
Okay. So now you see this, you see the
obs are dilated.
One sec. Stream catching up.
Dilate the obs by factor four
Dilate the obs by factor four
even. And now, yeah, there you
even. And now, yeah, there you
go. Now they should be able to freaking
see
right lower like lower resolution, but
right lower like lower resolution, but
they should be able to see.
they should be able to see.
Oh, for sure. Now they at least have
Oh, for sure. Now they at least have
an
an
idea of their universe.
Let's see if it's still like
Let's see if it's still like
um if it's still bad.
um if it's still bad.
If it's still
bad.
Doesn't seem any
better any recompiles and everything.
Kind of
surprising. Maybe it's a little more
surprising. Maybe it's a little more
stable. It's hard to say.
stable. It's hard to say.
I think it's probably pretty likely the
I think it's probably pretty likely the
um obs are no
good cuz now this should be able to do
good cuz now this should be able to do
things.
Um you want to humor me with a concept
Um you want to humor me with a concept
real quick? Mhm.
real quick? Mhm.
Instead of even having the whole end map
Instead of even having the whole end map
thing, just set it to one.
What?
What?
Set the OBS.
Set the OBS.
Oh, the value if it like one if the map
Oh, the value if it like one if the map
is not zero or what? Yeah. One if the
is not zero or what? Yeah. One if the
map is not zero. Yeah.
We could do
that. And then we'll have to edit
that. And then we'll have to edit
the the torch model, right?
the the torch model, right?
Yeah. To not like uber normalize it or
Yeah. To not like uber normalize it or
whatever.
Not doing any better than
15. That is suspicious. Mhm. I mean, it
15. That is suspicious. Mhm. I mean, it
can also be hypers and stuff as well,
can also be hypers and stuff as well,
right?
I guess so. Yeah. I mean, I would argue
I guess so. Yeah. I mean, I would argue
maybe this problem maybe need more
maybe this problem maybe need more
entropy or something.
entropy or something.
I don't know if you can know just from
I don't know if you can know just from
like
guessing. It crashes all the way down.
Totally Perf crashed. See
Totally Perf crashed. See
Mhm.
Mhm.
And then that's numerical bug.
just make sure if we train with full
just make sure if we train with full
batch doesn't magically.
batch doesn't magically.
No.
It is interesting that they're all going
It is interesting that they're all going
forward, isn't
it? Like they're not jittering around
it? Like they're not jittering around
and doing stuff.
and doing stuff.
So they've ignored
So they've ignored
turning. Well, they're turning, but
turning. Well, they're turning, but
they're like they're not

don't.
Did you eval it off stream? I didn't see
Did you eval it off stream? I didn't see
anything.
anything.
No, it's just from like what they were
No, it's just from like what they were
doing before.
Are we forgetting something in reset?
Are we forgetting something in reset?
Could be.
So all I do in reset is I randomize the
So all I do in reset is I randomize the
dozer positions. I zero out the dozer. I
dozer positions. I zero out the dozer. I
randomize the
randomize the
position. I reset the
tick. OBS returns. And then we copy the
tick. OBS returns. And then we copy the
original map.
Okay. Doesn't feel like there's anything
Okay. Doesn't feel like there's anything
missing from that. No.
missing from that. No.
And the score is like slightly higher
And the score is like slightly higher
than before, maybe. So maybe we need to
than before, maybe. So maybe we need to
just sweep stuff. I don't know.
Wait, wait, wait. I have I have an idea.
Wait, wait, wait. I have I have an idea.
I think that someone's agree with it.
I think that someone's agree with it.
Um, hold the phone. I see
Um, hold the phone. I see
something. I see
something. I see
something, but I want to verify it if
something, but I want to verify it if
I'm not being an idiot right now.
Okay, let's compare with other
environment. Oh yeah, your obs aren't
environment. Oh yeah, your obs aren't
going to each agent. You only have one
going to each agent. You only have one
ops for the entire thing that's shared.
What? How?
You're
You're
um you don't have agents times ops.
I have I
I have I
when No, no, no. When you initialize it,
when No, no, no. When you initialize it,
your your observation size is only M
your your observation size is only M

not num agents times M size M size. when
not num agents times M size M size. when
I initialize it. Yeah, when you allocate

I'm surprised this doesn't break [ __ ]
I'm surprised this doesn't break [ __ ]
but
Oh, I guess Okay, I guess you're right.
Oh, I guess Okay, I guess you're right.
That doesn't get used in the pipe. And
That doesn't get used in the pipe. And
also, it's this is huge. M size times M
also, it's this is huge. M size times M
size. It should be like times 121. So,
size. It should be like times 121. So,
that's like Yeah.
I guess it should be 121 times numbum
I guess it should be 121 times numbum
agents, right?
Yes. Until we change that.
And then
And then
secondarily to that concept in reset,
secondarily to that concept in reset,
you're not resetting each obs, you're
you're not resetting each obs, you're
just resetting one. Okay, let me check
just resetting one. Okay, let me check
that. Hang
that. Hang
on. Take a look at this policy first.
Boom. Like they drive around a bunch.
Boom. Like they drive around a bunch.
Well, I guess maybe it doesn't really
Well, I guess maybe it doesn't really
matter that much.
Are they actually doing it?
They might kind of be doing
They might kind of be doing
something
right. I mean, they're actually like

they're driving in a way that doesn't
they're driving in a way that doesn't

could be seeing [ __ ] [ __ ] or like not.
I'm trying to see from when watching it
I'm trying to see from when watching it
if like the ones they seem like that
if like the ones they seem like that
like they're like hanging out in the
like they're like hanging out in the
region that has a bunch of
region that has a bunch of
dirt to move. But like if you look at
dirt to move. But like if you look at
there's like a couple of them that just
there's like a couple of them that just
sit in an area where there's nothing
where the top is a bunch of stuff right
where the top is a bunch of stuff right
now. Then that left they're like eating
now. Then that left they're like eating
that pillar. They leave now. They leave
that pillar. They leave now. They leave
cuz they ate all the dirt. Oh, those
cuz they ate all the dirt. Oh, those
guys
don't. It looks like they eat that one
don't. It looks like they eat that one
pillar and
pillar and
then one guy gives up and stays in the
then one guy gives up and stays in the
corner.
How cool is this going to
look? Okay, this starts to get slow
look? Okay, this starts to get slow
because the mesh unloading.
We definitely need to figure that out so
We definitely need to figure that out so
that we can
that we can
like do a giant Mars
map.
Okay. Is it being reasonable or is it
Okay. Is it being reasonable or is it
not being reasonable? I don't know.
Nice to hear you're both articulating
Nice to hear you're both articulating
your thoughts. Now we can learn more.
your thoughts. Now we can learn more.
Yeah, sometimes when I'm doing fiddly
Yeah, sometimes when I'm doing fiddly
bits of dev, it's tough to like go
bits of dev, it's tough to like go
through everything. You can always ask
through everything. You can always ask
stuff though.
I want to just like set up a little
I want to just like set up a little
basic sweep while we're uh looking at
basic sweep while we're uh looking at
things just in case it finds something.
things just in case it finds something.
Yeah, that seems fair.
Oh yeah.
Also, we'll see if this does anything
Also, we'll see if this does anything
good.
Okay.
Okay.
But I think we should assume it
won't this up over
here. I mean, usual suspects, right, are
um observations, rewards, resets.
um observations, rewards, resets.
We took care of OBS. OBS is now like
We took care of OBS. OBS is now like
as stupid simple as possible.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. There's a big
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. There's a big
difference between um this thing's
difference between um this thing's
training at 1.5
training at 1.5
mil the first sweep
run that I don't know.
Weird.
Do you think the fact that it has an
Do you think the fact that it has an
action that does nothing affects it
action that does nothing affects it
learning or would it just learn to not
learning or would it just learn to not
use that action? Well, when I'm evaling
use that action? Well, when I'm evaling
it, I'm seeing it doing stuff.
Well, I know like you're seeing it do
Well, I know like you're seeing it do
stuff, but do you think that affects the
stuff, but do you think that affects the
process of learning or is it just like
process of learning or is it just like
it'll just learn to only send out the
it'll just learn to only send out the
other the correct versions for the
other the correct versions for the
other? I don't know. I mean, it needs
other? I don't know. I mean, it needs
kind of needs one because it's supposed
kind of needs one because it's supposed
to be able to pause in place and lower
to be able to pause in place and lower
the bucket and stuff.
Okay. Seems the reason
Okay, first experiment.
It definitely should be able to solve it
It definitely should be able to solve it
because ourware had a vision of its had
because ourware had a vision of its had
like nothing and it could still solve.
Observations are messed up somehow,

one square in front of its face.
one square in front of its face.
Mhm. And it's an easy solve,
Mhm. And it's an easy solve,
too. Like pretty immediate. It was Yeah,
too. Like pretty immediate. It was Yeah,
it was pretty immediate. It didn't even
it was pretty immediate. It didn't even
require like really much tuning at all.
require like really much tuning at all.
Yep.
So, what do we think here?
So, what do we think here?
There's possibly a question mark
on
on
maybe is the indexing wrong? I feel like
maybe is the indexing wrong? I feel like
it isn't.
it isn't.
Maybe doesn't seem like it would
be. Okay, you loop through all the
be. Okay, you loop through all the
agents at
agents at
each or each agent you're multiplying
each or each agent you're multiplying
by.
Wait, you're what the hell? Observation
Wait, you're what the hell? Observation
size two
times
times
11. Okay, so that's 121. Okay, so that
11. Okay, so that's 121. Okay, so that
should be
fine. Wait, where'd it go?
said you're going through agents. So
said you're going through agents. So
like that's going to make sure you get
like that's going to make sure you get
the right slice to the right guy.
You're multiplying X times observation
You're multiplying X times observation
size
size
because Y because that's getting the
because Y because that's getting the
right
index because two times vision plus one
index because two times vision plus one
is observation
is observation
size. Yes, it
is. We reconfirm the XY thing.
And we haven't gotten any good results
And we haven't gotten any good results
yet, I don't think, from the sweep
yet, I don't think, from the sweep
either.
either.
Plus, so that should be able to get
it. So that'll be your
it. So that'll be your
syntax here.
learn. Trying to think what else it
learn. Trying to think what else it
could be.
I'm

For a second, I was thinking maybe like
For a second, I was thinking maybe like
the bucket location was wrong, but I
the bucket location was wrong, but I
think that's okay. We're seeing it

harvest harvest stuff, right?
Could it be getting actions wrong
Could it be getting actions wrong
somehow?

I we see it like doing reasonable stuff

That felt like that like changed

because h some screwy there for
sure.
Would that cause an issue here? Think
Would that cause an issue here? Think
maybe. Would think so.
maybe. Would think so.
Good. I don't know what else it would
Good. I don't know what else it would
be.
Well, now seg faults, which is real
cool. Instantly
fixed. Let's go to run.
I mean, it would have to be screwed up
I mean, it would have to be screwed up
because
like I guess it actually depends on the
like I guess it actually depends on the
initial action buffer DT type, not the
initial action buffer DT type, not the
final one.
Let's run a little bit.
I know. It's not
I know. It's not
like we're not seeing anything like
like we're not seeing anything like
major

The fact this segment is a sketch.
Yeah, self actions is the correct D
Yeah, self actions is the correct D
type.
D type that error gets thrown. Yeah. So
D type that error gets thrown. Yeah. So
it was cast incorrectly basically. So,
it was cast incorrectly basically. So,
it was coming in from torch float 64,
it was coming in from torch float 64,
but then we were it was getting cast
but then we were it was getting cast
anyways.
But seemingly that hasn't changed
But seemingly that hasn't changed
anything.
anything.
Yeah. No, no, no. Like it was fine to
Yeah. No, no, no. Like it was fine to
begin with. It's like there was an

error, but like it got cancelceled out.
Okay, so it's running around.
Okay, so it's running around.
It's ideally it sees something that's
It's ideally it sees something that's
pretty much a one. It should run towards
pretty much a one. It should run towards
the one.
Yeah. So literally all this does it sets
Yeah. So literally all this does it sets
the pointer to the action pointer as
the pointer to the action pointer as
well.
Well, there are params that do way
Well, there are params that do way
worse, but I don't think that this means
worse, but I don't think that this means
it's good.
Um, well, one thing that I did in
Um, well, one thing that I did in
Rareware that we haven't done here is I
Rareware that we haven't done here is I
still give it the location
still give it the location

probably be useful though. I mean, it

Maybe it can't
Maybe it can't

right. Let's give it the additional uh
right. Let's give it the additional uh
the additional obs.
Yeah, it's just it's just plus one. And
Yeah, it's just it's just plus one. And
then we you're going to have to change
then we you're going to have to change
we'll have to change the torch. Wait, we
we'll have to change the torch. Wait, we
give it
give it
heading velocity. give it a heading and

it's the cell that it's in in the

Then we can add a flat layer that
Then we can add a flat layer that
connects the vision to this. Well, you
connects the vision to this. Well, you
want to give it like XY velocity
want to give it like XY velocity

Uh I don't even think you have to give

And that's tough. Good bargain. All
And that's tough. Good bargain. All

So, was giving it vision to nothing? Uh,
So, was giving it vision to nothing? Uh,
it's doing worse now. Really? Yeah. So,
it's doing worse now. Really? Yeah. So,
I think something is screw with the odds
I think something is screw with the odds
if it's doing worse, right? So, it
if it's doing worse, right? So, it
shouldn't be doing worse from that.
Like,

yeah, that seems

Yeah, it doesn't seem right.
Yeah, it doesn't seem right.
This would mean that they all have x of

Isn't it? I don't know.
Yeah, there we go.
Let's see if this at least gets us back
Let's see if this at least gets us back
to the original 16. Yeah, cuz I think
to the original 16. Yeah, cuz I think
there was a difference. Like when we put
there was a difference. Like when we put

It's weird that they have like they

Got it.
So, it doesn't have any ability to like
So, it doesn't have any ability to like
turn or do anything like it doesn't have
turn or do anything like it doesn't have
any ability to like slow
We'll see what this does
We'll see what this does
first. But if this does like 17 or
whatever. Okay.
Oh, 18. Oh, hang on. Look at that.
Oh, 18. Oh, hang on. Look at that.
That's We've never seen a 20.
Huh. So, yep. It just couldn't tell
Huh. So, yep. It just couldn't tell
where it was. Good
call. for honor and glory.
Oh, it's pumping. It's pumping.
I have some more ideas. It weirdly
I have some more ideas. It weirdly
collapses like from like 23 to 20. And
collapses like from like 23 to 20. And
then
it's doing things though.
it's doing things though.
It looks like it's at least improving.
Well, I don't know. It dropped to 19
Well, I don't know. It dropped to 19
now. Now I'm scared.
It will be
It will be
decimation of much
decimation of much
terrain. Fine tune this a bit. See if we
terrain. Fine tune this a bit. See if we
get something cool out of it. And then
get something cool out of it. And then
we can uh maybe this is dozen.
Maybe dozer time.
So, can you explain the whole like char
So, can you explain the whole like char
to float thing that you're doing with
to float thing that you're doing with
the times 40 and times 50? How do you
the times 40 and times 50? How do you
know that that's like give it a
know that that's like give it a
reasonable correct number? You only have
reasonable correct number? You only have
255 values to store stuff in a char.
255 values to store stuff in a char.
Yes. So, you should probably try to put
Yes. So, you should probably try to put
your data into a 0 to 255 so that when
your data into a 0 to 255 so that when
you normal like squash it back down like
you normal like squash it back down like
you at least get some reasonable
you at least get some reasonable
resolution.
So, like if I go if I go try to put the
So, like if I go if I go try to put the
value like five, uh, if I go try to put
value like five, uh, if I go try to put
like the value like 5.5 into a char,
like the value like 5.5 into a char,
right? Mhm. I'm only going to get five.
right? Mhm. I'm only going to get five.
Okay. Okay. Now, if I multiply it by 40
Okay. Okay. Now, if I multiply it by 40
and then I divide by 40 on the other
and then I divide by 40 on the other
side, I'm actually going to get
side, I'm actually going to get
something a lot closer.
to like what the the original value
to like what the the original value
should be like. Yes.
And are you dividing by 40 in the
And are you dividing by 40 in the
torch.py right now? I'm dividing by 255.
torch.py right now? I'm dividing by 255.
So I'm like trying to get them roughly
So I'm like trying to get them roughly
to the range of zero of to like 0 to
to the range of zero of to like 0 to
255.
Okay. Yeah. So, that's a nice trick to
Okay. Yeah. So, that's a nice trick to
know.
All right. So, here are terraforming
agents. These are apparently
agents. These are apparently
terraforming a bit better than
before. They are kind of fun to watch.
before. They are kind of fun to watch.
We should definitely get the uh the map
We should definitely get the uh the map
like render working nicer. Um but let's
like render working nicer. Um but let's
get there's one more experiment I want
get there's one more experiment I want
to try
first. So I just want to give them the
first. So I just want to give them the
like I want to up their acceleration
like I want to up their acceleration
speed.
Do you think if
Do you think if
um due to the dilation if it's like
um due to the dilation if it's like
right in front of
right in front of
you, there's a chance you won't see it
you, there's a chance you won't see it
anymore?
Yes.
Absolutely. I want to see if this
Absolutely. I want to see if this
actually helps him out at all.
Now they should actually be able to like
Now they should actually be able to like
stop like do
things and then if this works then what
things and then if this works then what
we'll do is we'll run the sweep on this
we'll do is we'll run the sweep on this
and then we will uh do some work on E
N.
N.
Yes, it's 5:31. I have dinner at 6.
Yes, it's 5:31. I have dinner at 6.
Okay, that timing works cuz I got to
Okay, that timing works cuz I got to
head out relatively soon as well.
Okay, but we will have the initial
Okay, but we will have the initial
version of this
version of this
end. a very simple initial prototype
end. a very simple initial prototype
uh
training and then I mean honestly the
training and then I mean honestly the
more the more important thing I think is
more the more important thing I think is
going to be like the you we can do like
going to be like the you we can do like
the initial digging capacity stuff
the initial digging capacity stuff
really easily before we have to do the
really easily before we have to do the
geometry for like axis aligned or
geometry for like axis aligned or
whatever this or
whatever this or
that but like we got to get like the
that but like we got to get like the
scale of it right and all
that I also would like to get the
that I also would like to get the
rendering to actually look like
rendering to actually look like
reasonable cuz I kind of just threw a
reasonable cuz I kind of just threw a
random pearl noise map at it. It like we
random pearl noise map at it. It like we
actually have to render based on height
actually have to render based on height
and such.
It is based on height. What are you What
It is based on height. What are you What
are you talking about?
are you talking about?
Uh the coloration is not based on
Uh the coloration is not based on
height.
height.
Oh,
Oh,
it's just a random pearl in map.
it's just a random pearl in map.
So like the texture when you're applying
So like the texture when you're applying
the
texture, this suddenly does way
texture, this suddenly does way
worse with more speed, more ability to
worse with more speed, more ability to
accelerate.
Yeah. Unless maybe it just takes longer
Yeah. Unless maybe it just takes longer
to learn something.
I think being able to like stop and
I think being able to like stop and
collect all the resources in an area
collect all the resources in an area
would be useful. No,
I don't see from your change how that
I don't see from your change how that
would have
would have
actually your goal. Well, if it's if it
actually your goal. Well, if it's if it
takes like 10 steps to accelerate, like
takes like 10 steps to accelerate, like
to decelerate, it might just not bother.
We could also make the thing just not be
We could also make the thing just not be
able to drive through um piles of stuff,
able to drive through um piles of stuff,
right? Pretty darn easily.
What? Like if you check two behind? No.
What? Like if you check two behind? No.
If you just like if you're if you're
If you just like if you're if you're
trying to move into dirt and your bucket
trying to move into dirt and your bucket
is full, you
can't. There are a lot of things we can
can't. There are a lot of things we can
do to like make this just a bit better.
do to like make this just a bit better.
Okay, let me fix Let me revert um the
Okay, let me fix Let me revert um the
thing that I did because I that doesn't
thing that I did because I that doesn't
seem to have helped. like heard it quite
seem to have helped. like heard it quite
a bit
actually.
Oops. So this is our most recent
run and this will be sweepable.
All
All
right. Solid.
Does it want to sweep right now or are
Does it want to sweep right now or are
you just rerunning the same pram to make
you just rerunning the same pram to make
sure it works?
The one on the left is just uh checking.
Is it done? Uh, we have something that's
Is it done? Uh, we have something that's
doing us like it is training. Yeah. Perf
doing us like it is training. Yeah. Perf
20. That's impressive.
20. That's impressive.
You have no idea of the scale.
from zero to one, isn't it? No, not in
from zero to one, isn't it? No, not in
this one. Oh, okay. How can we compare
this one. Oh, okay. How can we compare
them then? Oh, whatever.
them then? Oh, whatever.
We've been working on this a day. Yeah.
We've been working on this a day. Yeah.
Give it a second. I'm just giving you
Give it a second. I'm just giving you
crap.
All right. So, this is now
All right. So, this is now
Neptune
Terraform. Boom.
Terraform. Boom.
So, this will run a sweep
hopefully. And I think we can start with
hopefully. And I think we can start with
that. Um, you know,
that. Um, you know,
potentially working on the full
potentially working on the full
smoothing end, right? Like the full like
smoothing end, right? Like the full like
the full terraform end like um having it
the full terraform end like um having it
like pick up the dirt and then put it
like pick up the dirt and then put it
down instead of just deleting dirt. It
down instead of just deleting dirt. It
runs over.
Oh, you mean to like actually start like
Oh, you mean to like actually start like
having a target map? Mhm.
having a target map? Mhm.
Well, not just having a target map,
Well, not just having a target map,
right? Like it should be able to
right? Like it should be able to
actually Right now it's just driving
actually Right now it's just driving
over stuff and deleting it like load the
over stuff and deleting it like load the
bucket, drop dirt, like all that
bucket, drop dirt, like all that
proper terraform amp.
Does it eval? If we're doing proper
Does it eval? If we're doing proper
terraform, arguably, shouldn't we never
terraform, arguably, shouldn't we never
reset?
reset?
No, you can reset arbitrarily. Yeah, I I
No, you can reset arbitrarily. Yeah, I I
think you can reset arbitrarily because
think you can reset arbitrarily because
you can gen different maps,
but yeah, you could do it as just
but yeah, you could do it as just
continuous as well.
Okay. So, this will just this will
Okay. So, this will just this will
train. Hopefully, we're good on
this. Is the code pushed? Can I Can I
this. Is the code pushed? Can I Can I
try it or when you want to want to demo
try it or when you want to want to demo
it for
me? Oh, I want to I want to see it.
Oh, it's on dev. Um, bet we should also
Oh, it's on dev. Um, bet we should also
like we should fix the uh the damn
like we should fix the uh the damn
camera on this thing.
Okay.
Okay.
So, get me to fix the
camera. But these guys will run around
camera. But these guys will run around
and attempt to flatten
everything. It's like pretty darn smooth
everything. It's like pretty darn smooth
the movement, huh?
Yeah, the dynamics are pretty chill.
Uh, is this is this trained or is this
Uh, is this is this trained or is this
just Yeah, that's trained.
just Yeah, that's trained.
I can't see them flattening stuff. Uh,
I can't see them flattening stuff. Uh,
camera's shitty.
camera's shitty.
Oh, like are the little hills getting
Oh, like are the little hills getting
smaller?
smaller?
Yeah. So,
I still feel like as like just how it is
I still feel like as like just how it is
currently which is like kind of like a
currently which is like kind of like a
fine resource
fine resource
problem. It should be still doing better
problem. It should be still doing better
though. Yeah. Yeah, it should be. But we
though. Yeah. Yeah, it should be. But we
will uh we'll see from sweep and then we
will uh we'll see from sweep and then we
also have stuff to fiddle with.
also have stuff to fiddle with.
It is training.
It is training.
I mean, one parameter change on gamma on
I mean, one parameter change on gamma on
GPU drive makes it like learn nothing
GPU drive makes it like learn nothing
versus learn something pretty much.
versus learn something pretty much.
Yeah, it's gamma for
you. Is this camera like not what I
you. Is this camera like not what I
think it
think it
is? I like I don't understand how the
is? I like I don't understand how the
hell this camera works.
hell this camera works.
Yeah, cuz like we want to be
Yeah, cuz like we want to be
Well, you want to be above, right?
Well, you want to be above, right?
Yeah. Or like
But when I enter these params in, it
But when I enter these params in, it
doesn't freaking work. Like, I don't get
doesn't freaking work. Like, I don't get
this view when I enter these params.
Yeah. So, it's probably not what it
Yeah. So, it's probably not what it
looks like.
Joseph, I wonder if you
um turn off dilation, it'll if that will
um turn off dilation, it'll if that will
actually change anything because now
actually change anything because now
that it knows like where it is.
that it knows like where it is.
We can definitely try that
We can definitely try that
now. Zip
This is freaking camera.
So these are hardcoded I think.
compile time only. Okay. So, we have to
compile time only. Okay. So, we have to
scale some things, I
scale some things, I
think, to get the uh the camera to work
think, to get the uh the camera to work
the way we want. I can just get
the way we want. I can just get
something that's like decent for now.
something that's like decent for now.
How do you want it to work? You want it
How do you want it to work? You want it
to work like Photoshop where you kind of
to work like Photoshop where you kind of
can like zoom in, drag around, rotate,
can like zoom in, drag around, rotate,
perspective. Well, it's just the
perspective. Well, it's just the
camera's clipping.
camera's clipping.
I don't know what you mean by clipping
I don't know what you mean by clipping
in this case. Okay, look. You see this?
in this case. Okay, look. You see this?
Oh, on the out. Okay. When you're Is it
Oh, on the out. Okay. When you're Is it
when you're too far away? Yeah.
This is fine, though. I'll do this for
This is fine, though. I'll do this for
now.
do this
cube. All right. Now, do you want to try
cube. All right. Now, do you want to try
dilation?
dilation?
I can do
that. Uh what would we say? Dilation.
that. Uh what would we say? Dilation.
Yeah. Yeah. To make it okay.
Yeah. Yeah. To make it okay.
Just not have it. Yeah.
What's your mini game represent? It is
What's your mini game represent? It is
uh we're working on an excavation
uh we're working on an excavation
sim. So, the goal is going to be that
sim. So, the goal is going to be that
you have uh a initial landscape and then
you have uh a initial landscape and then
you have a target landscape and you move
you have a target landscape and you move
all the dirt
all the dirt
around to terraform, I don't know,
around to terraform, I don't know,
terraform Mars or whatever.
terraform Mars or whatever.
It'll be
fun. Care for Mars.
I too love pressing the up arrow until I
I too love pressing the up arrow until I
can find the
command. What's going on
command. What's going on
here? Terraforming
here? Terraforming
Mars. We'll see if this works in the
meantime. All right, so we've got this
meantime. All right, so we've got this
N. Oops. We've got this N
here. And uh these are just random cars
here. And uh these are just random cars
at the
at the
moment. But yeah, the landscape here,
moment. But yeah, the landscape here,
you can see it's not rendered amazingly
you can see it's not rendered amazingly
well yet, but um here, let's see if you
well yet, but um here, let's see if you
can see like them cutting through some
can see like them cutting through some
of it. Yeah, so they just cut a pathway
of it. Yeah, so they just cut a pathway
right through there. See this
right through there. See this
pathway also. Yes, do start the repo.

That helps us out a lot. It's all open

It's weird that some of them like just

No, this is random.
No, this is random.
This one is random. Oh, this one's
This one is random. Oh, this one's
random. Uh, yeah. I I set it on this
random. Uh, yeah. I I set it on this
because I can't scroll the camera around
because I can't scroll the camera around
on the other one. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
on the other one. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I got you. So, they're always set
Yeah. I got you. So, they're always set
to digging, right? They're always
to digging, right? They're always
digging.
digging.
Yeah, they're not they're not uh it's
Yeah, they're not they're not uh it's
just at the moment it's just bulldozing
just at the moment it's just bulldozing
over everything.
over everything.
There's no noop.
There's no noop.
I think technically there is a noop
I think technically there is a noop
where you can just drive and not dig.
Oh, no, no, no. It's digging is always
Oh, no, no, no. It's digging is always
on. Digging because it may it may be
on. Digging because it may it may be
more efficient to drive and not dig
more efficient to drive and not dig
sometimes.
So far, it seems like it's done better
So far, it seems like it's done better
with the
with the
dilation. But it's actually learning
dilation. But it's actually learning
stuff either way. Now, let's see the uh
stuff either way. Now, let's see the uh
let's see the
let's see the
Neptune. Okay, so yeah, but the graph
Neptune. Okay, so yeah, but the graph
looks a little smoother on this one.
looks a little smoother on this one.
I think
I think
it's still climbing. I mean, it's at
it's still climbing. I mean, it's at
like 19 now.
like 19 now.
Okay. So, here are here's the new sweep.
Okay. So, do they have to be moving to
Okay. So, do they have to be moving to
bulldo or so far? Yes. because we were
bulldo or so far? Yes. because we were
debugging stuff.
debugging stuff.
Cuz if they get bull in place, they
Cuz if they get bull in place, they
might just stay on the ground and No,
might just stay on the ground and No,
cuz it just deletes all the dirt and
cuz it just deletes all the dirt and
they don't get any more
they don't get any more
reward. I mean, it's not done obviously,

move dirt around, not just like eat

Well, the dirt's just going away right
Well, the dirt's just going away right
now. Yeah, it's like Pac-Man. We're just

trying to get it to see if we can like,
trying to get it to see if we can like,
you know, train like have some basic

super complicated. That would that would

make that would make sense. Um, yeah,
just saying performance is looking
just saying performance is looking
pretty comparable.
pretty comparable.
Yeah. I mean, we can try either way.
Yeah. I mean, we can try either way.
We'll probably just stick it into a

Yeah. All right. Maybe it's not as

How long are you running experiments
How long are you running experiments
for? 100 mil.
Okay. Oh, okay. Maybe dilation does help
Okay. Oh, okay. Maybe dilation does help
because this thing looks like it just
because this thing looks like it just
entirely collapsed. I think it's
entirely collapsed. I think it's
probably just like poorly tuned other
probably just like poorly tuned other
params, right?
The dilation should help
though. It's a good trick.
All right, let's go add the dilation
All right, let's go add the dilation
back in because
back in because
Yeah. What did I say? Was it four? Yeah,
Yeah. What did I say? Was it four? Yeah,
it was four. Yes. Yes, it was four.
I know you don't want obs to be big, but
I know you don't want obs to be big, but
what if you did like a super wide
what if you did like a super wide
dilation and then a really small for
dilation and then a really small for
like fine grade around
like fine grade around
you at some point?
you at some point?
I mean, yeah, we could just come up with
I mean, yeah, we could just come up with
a formula that does that.
So, what does dilation do?
So, what does dilation do?
Uh, it's Let me show
you. See these white dots?
No, there are white dots around the
No, there are white dots around the

catch up. Yeah. So, it can see
catch up. Yeah. So, it can see
everywhere there's a white dot.
everywhere there's a white dot.
So, it's an 11 by 11 grid, but it's not
So, it's an 11 by 11 grid, but it's not
dense. It's sparse.
dense. It's sparse.
Yeah. It doesn't need to see every
Yeah. It doesn't need to see every
point, though. All it needs to see is a
point, though. All it needs to see is a
point that's higher than the other
point that's higher than the other
points dirt wise. Yeah. So, it should be
points dirt wise. Yeah. So, it should be
able to do that from this grid.
able to do that from this grid.
Dilation is just spreading them out
Dilation is just spreading them out
then. Or Mhm. pretty much. Yeah. Why
then. Or Mhm. pretty much. Yeah. Why
don't Why don't you have just like
don't Why don't you have just like
really big sort of
really big sort of
sparse views?

This is what that is. I mean, I could

this on like a actual measurement basis?
this on like a actual measurement basis?
No idea yet. We have to scale things
No idea yet. We have to scale things
correctly

cuz like I don't even think the dozers

close attention to like your immediate

There you go. Let's add

like five. Yeah, so do I, man.
All right. I mean, this is like decent
All right. I mean, this is like decent
progress. We will see. Uh we'll see if

anything comes out of the sweep. Uh
anything comes out of the sweep. Uh
there's still some fiddly bits with
there's still some fiddly bits with
sweeps at the moment, but we will see if
sweeps at the moment, but we will see if
anything comes out of sweeps. And then
anything comes out of sweeps. And then
yeah, we uh this is like a decent base
yeah, we uh this is like a decent base
for New Sim. Like I think we can
for New Sim. Like I think we can
probably get uh get it doing a bunch of
probably get uh get it doing a bunch of
things if we just make the well improve

I'll just do outro now.
I'll just do outro now.
you want me to kind of do as a next
you want me to kind of do as a next

commented block of logic where it's like
commented block of logic where it's like
fill up with dirt and then like you know
fill up with dirt and then like you know
drop dirt probably that. Okay.
And I would just make it so it can't

keep it can't go forward if uh the
keep it can't go forward if uh the
bucket's full and it's pushing up
bucket's full and it's pushing up
against dirt. So, if it's trying to pick
against dirt. So, if it's trying to pick
up more dirt and the bucket's full, it
up more dirt and the bucket's full, it
just gets stuck. that'll like you'll

though um wait why is it that small
cuz it's that small. It's 11 by 11. But
cuz it's that small. It's 11 by 11. But
I messed that up.
You didn't make it
big. Okay. Well, now the camera
big. Okay. Well, now the camera
centering is like completely screwed or
centering is like completely screwed or
something because it doesn't there's
something because it doesn't there's
nothing that shows up if I make it

So, we need to get like the basics of
So, we need to get like the basics of
this thing, I think, before we can do um
this thing, I think, before we can do um
figure out the really the digging
figure out the really the digging
pieces,
right? Let me figure out how we would
right? Let me figure out how we would
render
render
render a height map.
All right, let me mess with
All right, let me mess with
the the size thing that you
the the size thing that you
did. All right. Why is size being funky?
All right, I fixed it.
All right, I fixed it.
Okay,
Okay,
it's a it's a change you can just do on
it's a it's a change you can just do on
your end. Um, what is it?
your end. Um, what is it?
What you do is you look in the make
client line 185 a nit window. Just make
client line 185 a nit window. Just make
it a fixed 800 by 600.
Okay. Holy, look at that.
Okay. So, I mean, we can't really see
Okay. So, I mean, we can't really see
what the hell's going on here. And like
what the hell's going on here. And like
the controls are backwards and things,
the controls are backwards and things,
but that's something.
Also, I think it's like there's not very
Also, I think it's like there's not very
much variation in the height, is there?
much variation in the height, is there?
No, there's not. You have to change the
No, there's not. You have to change the
factor to be Yeah. Um, okay. I think I
factor to be Yeah. Um, okay. I think I
changed it to one over four, but just
changed it to one over four, but just
make it like two or something.
make it like two or something.
Well, there are two things happening,
Well, there are two things happening,
right? So, there's the pearl and noise,
right? So, there's the pearl and noise,
the math height, and then there's the
the math height, and then there's the
render height.
Um, well, render height's just one right

I mean, you probably could see massive
I mean, you probably could see massive
differences, but that wouldn't be like
differences, but that wouldn't be like
accurate, per say. Yeah. All right. So,
accurate, per say. Yeah. All right. So,
let's
let's
like
like
Yeah. All right. Can you figure that
Yeah. All right. Can you figure that
stuff out? I'm gonna see if I I'm gonna
stuff out? I'm gonna see if I I'm gonna
see if I can figure out this like
see if I can figure out this like
meshing. Yeah. Make it like all sorts of
meshing. Yeah. Make it like all sorts of
choppy.
choppy.
Like make it look like some hills or
Like make it look like some hills or
whatever, right? Not like choppy. You
whatever, right? Not like choppy. You
want like some hills. All right.
Raib have a

Does Okay, so Red Lib does have a thing
Does Okay, so Red Lib does have a thing
for this.
All right. So I
think is
interesting. Going to do this locally so
interesting. Going to do this locally so
I can actually render things.
I think whoever told me to keep my neck

Did you
Did you
um My next thing was going to work on
um My next thing was going to work on
making it look decent with hills. Did
making it look decent with hills. Did
you said you when I was walking away, I
you said you when I was walking away, I
overheard you saying something like Oh,
overheard you saying something like Oh,
I'm looking into the mesh gen. I'm
I'm looking into the mesh gen. I'm
trying to figure out mesh gen stuff
trying to figure out mesh gen stuff
right now.
right now.
So, yeah. get the terrain to like
So, yeah. get the terrain to like
generate correct heights while I mess
generate correct heights while I mess
with this uh this mesh gen to see if we
with this uh this mesh gen to see if we
can have like instead of just drawing
can have like instead of just drawing
cubes.
width
width
length res x Let's see.
Okay. Then I got to figure out what the
Okay. Then I got to figure out what the
mesh is.
Wait. Models heightmap.
Save. That looks
good. Then mesh height
map. Huh?
I feel like I'm not getting a lot of
I feel like I'm not getting a lot of
good values from this preent noise right
good values from this preent noise right
now. So there's octaves and then there's
now. So there's octaves and then there's
the frequency.
Okay, I
Okay, I
found
found
something.
Think so.
What is the role of octaves verse
What is the role of octaves verse
frequency in Berlin noise?
frequency in Berlin noise?
So
So
octaves octave is how many different
octaves octave is how many different
waveforms get summed together like you
waveforms get summed together like you
get like
get like
a kind of like a hilly map out of each
a kind of like a hilly map out of each
octave. Uh but they're at different
octave. Uh but they're at different
frequencies. Some of them are like going
frequencies. Some of them are like going
to be like very bumpy. Some of them are
to be like very bumpy. Some of them are
going to be like big hills, right? And
going to be like big hills, right? And
then the frequency defines
then the frequency defines
um like actually how big or how small
um like actually how big or how small
the hills are like how like spread
the hills are like how like spread
together pushed apart they are.
together pushed apart they are.
the frequency you said does that. Yeah.
the frequency you said does that. Yeah.
So like probably like I don't know two
So like probably like I don't know two
to four octaves and then play with the
to four octaves and then play with the
frequency until you get something that
frequency until you get something that
looks
reasonable. It's probably not going to
reasonable. It's probably not going to
generate data in like the height scale
generate data in like the height scale
that you're looking for though. Like you
that you're looking for though. Like you
might have to multiply the height the
might have to multiply the height the
thing. Yeah, that's what I did. I'm
thing. Yeah, that's what I did. I'm
adding a a height scale factor.
And I'm just going to make it
And I'm just going to make it
giganto. And then I think I just need
giganto. And then I think I just need
more things to end
more things to end
probably cuz I think what's going to
probably cuz I think what's going to
happen is you're just going to end with
gaps. You know what I mean? Uh what do
gaps. You know what I mean? Uh what do
you mean gaps?
you mean gaps?
like between the space of
like between the space of
Oh, well, we're going to make we're
Oh, well, we're going to make we're
going to get like a proper mesh renderer
going to get like a proper mesh renderer
for this thing.
for this thing.
Cuz if I'm just drawing cubes, I think
Cuz if I'm just drawing cubes, I think
what it will do is just spawn cubes far
what it will do is just spawn cubes far
apart from each other if you go super
hilly. So, I need some way to like
draw between cubes at the next spot
arguably.
arguably.
Well, it's that's going to be done by
Well, it's that's going to be done by
the height map thing,
right? Okay. So, I found the
right? Okay. So, I found the
implementation of this
Okay, so now we have the source code for
Okay, so now we have the source code for
how they generate meshes.
how they generate meshes.
Okay,
so I think I can just like take this and
so I think I can just like take this and
we can edit this to not have to load
we can edit this to not have to load
from a freaking
image. That would be ideal.
just do Take
I got to say race's getting a few
I got to say race's getting a few
demerits for the uh new line curly
demerits for the uh new line curly
braces.
Okay. Like, yeah,
Okay. Like, yeah,
maybe maybe
maybe maybe
this. We will see.
Are you a
troll? Everything's the same color.
troll? Everything's the same color.
like can't tell the difference. Yeah,
like can't tell the difference. Yeah,
we'll fix that. There's actually cuz we
we'll fix that. There's actually cuz we
can actually get um we're going to be
can actually get um we're going to be
able to apply like a a checker texture
able to apply like a a checker texture
to it super
to it super
easily. Going to be
easily. Going to be
nice. Right. So, we've got this mesh and
nice. Right. So, we've got this mesh and

then come
on. Where's their

probably like draw a mesh or something,

Yeah, I got a similar thing right now
Yeah, I got a similar thing right now

that out.
I have a different version than you, I

Holy We want

Huh?

confused. Yeah, I think we uh I think
confused. Yeah, I think we uh I think
that this pearl and noise function is
that this pearl and noise function is
kind of screwy. So, we're going to leave
kind of screwy. So, we're going to leave
this at two for
now and then we'll give you this. I
now and then we'll give you this. I

See how it's like multi octave?

So, we probably want to gen the instead

of scaling the

And then are you just going to scale it
And then are you just going to scale it
in the map? No, I'm doing I'm doing it
in the map? No, I'm doing I'm doing it
right I'm fixing it to

Wait, you have a Oh, that's a different
Wait, you have a Oh, that's a different

that's a normalized.
Arguably, should you apply your scale to
Arguably, should you apply your scale to
the post-normalized version?
Yeah. Okay, that's what you should do.
Yeah. Okay, that's what you should do.
All right, that's like that's good.
All right, that's like that's good.
That's like now actually what we see. So
That's like now actually what we see. So
now we can render the dozer on top of

supposed to be like five.
Oh,
okay. I think we're going to not
okay. I think we're going to not
actually move the dozers to start
with physical AI stuff like robots.
We've done some gem stuff for robots,
We've done some gem stuff for robots,
but we haven't done physical hardware.
but we haven't done physical hardware.
We might be able to do some fun physical
We might be able to do some fun physical
hardware stuff with dish. We'll see. All
hardware stuff with dish. We'll see. All
right. So, there's some dozers. They're
right. So, there's some dozers. They're
just
cubes. For
cubes. For
now, kind of at weird heights.
now, kind of at weird heights.
Oh, I'm not looking. What do you got? I
Oh, I'm not looking. What do you got? I
mean, I have cubes rendering on it where
mean, I have cubes rendering on it where
the dozers are. They're at weird
heights. See if I fix that.
There's probably they're probably not
There's probably they're probably not
aligned with the mesh as the thing,
aligned with the mesh as the thing,
right?
right?
No, they're for sure not because you're

just spawning it and then it's just
just spawning it and then it's just
drawing itself at whatever dimension you

can make. Well, I think that it's the
can make. Well, I think that it's the
scale factor. Honestly,
I thought the scale factor is already a
I thought the scale factor is already a
part of the um Yeah, but there's like
part of the um Yeah, but there's like
the original function. The code came
the original function. The code came
with like this
weird. I mean, there are like things
weird. I mean, there are like things
here,
here,
but they're not lined up with the map at
but they're not lined up with the map at
all. So, the map's probably like drawn
all. So, the map's probably like drawn
weird
somehow. All right. Don't use that dozer
somehow. All right. Don't use that dozer
I sent you. What? Don't use the dozer I
I sent you. What? Don't use the dozer I
sent you. I'm in Blender and it came out
weird. The colors like
weird. The colors like
didn't sink
didn't sink
correctly. Let me see if I like the way
correctly. Let me see if I like the way
it looks.
Anyways, it's not a bad dozer. That's
Anyways, it's not a bad dozer. That's
actually a pretty solid
actually a pretty solid
dozer. Yeah, for some reason the colors
dozer. Yeah, for some reason the colors
didn't like actually work in
didn't like actually work in
Blender. There's like a file issue or
Blender. There's like a file issue or
something. Find a different one. That's
problems. There's a ton of them on Turbo
problems. There's a ton of them on Turbo
Squid. Yeah, there really are. Huh.
The ones that the low poly one is just
The ones that the low poly one is just
the free one, but there's obviously like
the free one, but there's obviously like
tons that are like 50 80 bucks or
tons that are like 50 80 bucks or
whatever. Yeah, I don't mind buying
whatever. Yeah, I don't mind buying
them, but like I don't know if there are
them, but like I don't know if there are
any of them that we like it's not good
any of them that we like it's not good
to do like the realistic ones cuz it'll
to do like the realistic ones cuz it'll
look weird when the rest of it doesn't
look weird when the rest of it doesn't
look the same.
like actually you kind of got the best
like actually you kind of got the best
one.
Yeah. Well, let me try to screw with it
Yeah. Well, let me try to screw with it
in Blender because it's like not turning
in Blender because it's like not turning
out the
out the
right. Go ahead and change it to proper

colors.
Is this it? Okay. Bulldozer texture.
Okay. All right. There we go. This is
Okay. All right. There we go. This is
now. Now we're making things happen.
now. Now we're making things happen.
Yeah, we're making things
Yeah, we're making things
happen. Unfortunately, it's texture was
happen. Unfortunately, it's texture was
just like I don't know. There's an error
just like I don't know. There's an error
with it. So, I'm just coloring it
with it. So, I'm just coloring it
myself.
Do you need color codes?
Do you need color codes?
Um, if you want. I'm just kind of
Um, if you want. I'm just kind of
dragging on the color wheel right now.
dragging on the color wheel right now.
So, it's um this the the color intensity
So, it's um this the the color intensity
it's
it's

187. So like red is 187 0 0 and the sign
is 0 1871
is 0 1871

Well, I feel like it has to be yellow.
Well, I feel like it has to be yellow.
It does not have to be yellow.
It does not have to be yellow.
Sure it does. Okay, fine. You can make
Sure it does. Okay, fine. You can make
it You can make it freaking yellow for

now. But it's getting the puffer
treatment.

All right. It's getting the puffer
All right. It's getting the puffer
treatment at some point.
It's going to get the Tron
aesthetic. Okay, there we go. Now I'm
aesthetic. Okay, there we go. Now I'm
actually looking at freaking hex codes
actually looking at freaking hex codes
and not just like screwing with random
and not just like screwing with random
things.
You said it's 187 0 0. Yeah, for red.
You said it's 187 0 0. Yeah, for red.
Well, not 0000. That's that's no
Well, not 0000. That's that's no

No, I mean that's fine. You just spent
No, I mean that's fine. You just spent
187 for the red. But And then do you
187 for the red. But And then do you
know what it is for the the buffer deal?
know what it is for the the buffer deal?
Yeah, it's 0 187 187.
Yeah, it's 0 187 187.
Oh yeah, that's what I
meant. Trying to figure out why this
meant. Trying to figure out why this
thing doesn't line up the way it
thing doesn't line up the way it
should. Feel like this looks brighter
than
whatever. I just copy paste and click on
whatever. I just copy paste and click on
everything. It's the same.
Oh, for sure. That did not help.
Damn. All right, this looks kind of
tight. If only I could get it to load on
tight. If only I could get it to load on
the right spot.
the right spot.
All
right. All
right, I'm dropping you dozer file.
right, I'm dropping you dozer file.
Okay, I'm going to upload
this. All right, there's your file in
this. All right, there's your file in
Discord chat.
Yeah, I just pushed to version. See if
Yeah, I just pushed to version. See if
you can figure out why the uh it doesn't
you can figure out why the uh it doesn't
line up to the terrain. I'll get this
line up to the terrain. I'll get this
dozer loaded in in the
meantime. I can't figure out why it

doesn't line up with the damn

Do you know if there's a CLI command to

What? No idea.
What? No idea.
I'll chat to you later.
Yeah, nice job with this pearl and
Yeah, nice job with this pearl and
noise. It looks
good. We'll deal with the checkered [ __ ]
later. Okay, let's load in this model.

doing loading. I'm loading the model in
doing loading. I'm loading the model in
right now. Spencer, I'll get that
right now. Spencer, I'll get that
working. Just can you figure out why the
working. Just can you figure out why the
hell the uh the cube doesn't draw at the

Okay. Thank you.
Holy memory leak.

Well, I haven't we haven't bothered

Okay, I see tiny

cube. Do you want it to be tilted? No,
cube. Do you want it to be tilted? No,
it's just it just doesn't it's not
it's just it just doesn't it's not
drawing correctly. There are eight of

them and they there eight of them
them and they there eight of them
randomly placed and they should all be

like level with the terrain wherever
they are.
Well, that's what I mean when you're
Well, that's what I mean when you're
saying level. You're level generally
saying level. You're level generally
means like it's like if it's at a 45
means like it's like if it's at a 45
degree angle, the cube will also be at a

it's floating. They they're all floating

or underneath the map right now.
Okay.
loser.
Yo, we got
dozer. Missing a

All right. Well,
All right. Well,
whatever. There is a

I highlighted the whole thing. So, we'll

Yes, it should be.

So, I'm going do that.
Get the freaking wheel on it
Get the freaking wheel on it
still. We'll figure that
still. We'll figure that
out. Got the height fix.

Not done.
Not done.
Gotcha. But you see the bug?
Well, I presume the bug is just that
Well, I presume the bug is just that
it's at the wrong height. Um because you
it's at the wrong height. Um because you
picked just random between zero and
picked just random between zero and
size. I
mean, what I need to check out is Okay,
mean, what I need to check out is Okay,
so how's the rendering of this going to
so how's the rendering of this going to
be? That's super weird.
Well, I guess X and Y could just be,
but they have mesh gun examples.
So, do you have a Z going on here?
So, do you have a Z going on here?
Right. Or what? Yeah, you have to. Okay.
Right. Or what? Yeah, you have to. Okay.
Be XZ, I think. So, Z's are a
thing. Trying to Okay. Well, let's just

see what happens with
this. Caleb is kind of really good.
Why is it? This height map
looks the source code. It doesn't show
looks the source code. It doesn't show
you the source code.
Wait, you don't have a Z parameter in
Wait, you don't have a Z parameter in
your dozer struct.
Well, you don't have a Z in your dozer.
Well, you don't have a Z in your dozer.
Well, the dozer doesn't need to know
it's The dozer is always on the flat
it's The dozer is always on the flat
ground, right?

It's like always just at the height of
It's like always just at the height of
the terrain at that All right.
Okay, I see what you're trying to
This is really weird that this isn't
This is really weird that this isn't
drawing correctly.
Yo, this is freaking cool.
Yo, this is freaking cool.
Whoa. What the hell? Yeah.
Yeah.
For some reason, cubes are still

have this logic
and power climb?
What are you trying to figure out? How

It's dozer Y.
Hell. Oh, well that's not
it. Standing on it.
So it's
um what which what would it be also like
um what which what would it be also like
so you translate it to the
so you translate it to the

rotate probably don't need this one.
You don't need to double rotate for

sure. Um, well, this is like Okay, so
sure. Um, well, this is like Okay, so
what would be helpful is you start with
Okay, find what your base thing is and
Okay, find what your base thing is and
then
then
apply the rotation and then apply the
apply the rotation and then apply the
rotation afterwards
rotation afterwards
again cuz like you need to make sure
again cuz like you need to make sure
that your your base model is rotated
that your your base model is rotated
correctly in the first place. Like is it
correctly in the first place. Like is it
upright? Is it whatever? It's pointing
upright? Is it whatever? It's pointing
this way. Yeah.
this way. Yeah.
So, is it is it correct? Well, it's
So, is it is it correct? Well, it's
pointing this way. I don't know what
the model should just be exported to
the model should just be exported to
point the correct way, right? Sometimes

it's weird.
And then I mean the main thing is it

Why are you doing 90? That's what was in
Why are you doing 90? That's what was in
your code. Okay. I don't know if it's in

Look like they're turning.
No.
No.

What do you mean the negative 90? Is

that something I had prior? Yeah.
You're
You're
reading the not in degrees.
Oh, I guess maybe then that we don't
Oh, I guess maybe then that we don't
need this offset, but we would see it
need this offset, but we would see it
rotating either way.
This is just not rotating somehow. Well,
This is just not rotating somehow. Well,
if you took the the the 90 plus from

Okay. Yeah. Yeah, you got rid of that.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah, you got rid of that.
Okay,
Okay,
good. But that for sure is not rotating.
Isn't it? It should rotate around the Y
Isn't it? It should rotate around the Y

If we're setting the
If we're setting the

We see some
We see some

Well, this is rotating the wrong axis.
Well, this is rotating the wrong axis.
See, I think I think the one is the axis
See, I think I think the one is the axis
of which it rotates on. Well, then it's
of which it rotates on. Well, then it's
the wrong one because it's it's tilting
the wrong one because it's it's tilting
it. Okay, then just make the one like
it. Okay, then just make the one like
the X the the first zero or the second

No, no, no. You You're not rotating
No, no, no. You You're not rotating

like Z one 0 one, it's one of those.
Yeah, there it is. It's a common there.
So it's like

this is like angled correctly, but
um it's like that's it's we have Josers

Okay, so there we go. That should be a

not moving like parallel to they're
not moving like parallel to they're
facing
though. Could be a negative or
though. Could be a negative or
something. Hard to
something. Hard to
say. We can get them to line up though.
say. We can get them to line up though.
How do we
um I guess we do dirt moving now, right?
I mean, I think first we probably want
I mean, I think first we probably want
to fix the direction it's facing. I
to fix the direction it's facing. I
mean, we could we could bother fixing
mean, we could we could bother fixing
it. Okay.
Um, how do we fix
Um, how do we fix
it? Negative because right now we don't
it? Negative because right now we don't
know what direction it's actually going
know what direction it's actually going
in.
Not this one.
Are you are you
Are you are you
um binding your heading into radiance or
um binding your heading into radiance or
whatever? Uh it should be radian. Yeah.
whatever? Uh it should be radian. Yeah.
Well, I'm not here. I'll show you it.
Movement
logic. What's up with the minus
two when you set your steer? What's up
two when you set your steer? What's up
with the minus two? You do minus two.
with the minus two? You do minus two.
Discretet uh goes from five to subtract
Discretet uh goes from five to subtract
two. So it's 0 through four, which
two. So it's 0 through four, which
centers it and then it scales
it. You can turn.2 radians,.1 radians or
it. You can turn.2 radians,.1 radians or
0 radians.1 radians or radians.
Okay. your V * cosine
You just want to take the dynamics I had
You just want to take the dynamics I had
in GPU drive to a
in GPU drive to a
cuz arguably what you're doing right now
cuz arguably what you're doing right now
is you're rotating
and
then now mind you I don't think my
then now mind you I don't think my
physics was Honestly, probably that
physics was Honestly, probably that
correct, but at least you have move
correct, but at least you have move
expert in the C step by the way.
Yeah, I haven't gone back and fixed the
Yeah, I haven't gone back and fixed the
whatever it's called.
Um the re the resampling thing
yet. This dynamics thing
yet. This dynamics thing
And this dynamics thing, it makes sure
And this dynamics thing, it makes sure
that you turn at a
rate based on your speed.
Well, I think the problem is we have
Well, I think the problem is we have
some weird offset now, right? That's
some weird offset now, right? That's
like that's just going to make it even
like that's just going to make it even
harder for us to debug it. Like we
harder for us to debug it. Like we
should probably use this, but once we
should probably use this, but once we
like have it actually facing the right
like have it actually facing the right
way. No.
Okay, I hear you. Let me try and look
Okay, I hear you. Let me try and look
through it. on this as to why something
through it. on this as to why something
like that would be
wrong. It should
be is the camera
angled it should be facing like in the
angled it should be facing like in the
positive X direction. The base model
positive X direction. The base model
should be
You can test this by just setting
You can test this by just setting
heading to
heading to
zero, right?
zero, right?
Uh, okay.
Or it depends what you want your zero to
Or it depends what you want your zero to
be, I guess, cuz that's
Okay, it's 180 degrees off. It looks
Okay, it's 180 degrees off. It looks
like it's just
like it's just
backwards. They stopped gracefully. Oh,
nice. Are they rotating at all?
Hey, look at these
dozers. Let's see if it actually still
dozers. Let's see if it actually still
looks good once we uh add the driving
looks good once we uh add the driving
opponent back.
Now see, they get off centered
here. It's
minus. Yep, there it is. Got
minus. Yep, there it is. Got
it.
it.
Minus. Look at these. These look cool.
just driving all over.
just driving all over.
Actually, fairly smooth.
You may not even need to do the the
You may not even need to do the the
dynamics from the GPU drive stuff. This
dynamics from the GPU drive stuff. This
may just be like reasonable.
All right, I'm going to give you uh
All right, I'm going to give you uh
commit this up here. We are going to
commit this up here. We are going to
going to do the next thing, man.
daytime. Okay, there you go.
Let me use the restroom real quick. And
Let me use the restroom real quick. And
um yeah,
um yeah,
you're going to have to start thinking
you're going to have to start thinking
about digging, digging of things.
Hello.
Yo,
speaking time. Yeah.
So, how do we dig
We have to create the bucket. Yeah.
Well, we just have to
Well, we just have to
know where it is.
know where it is.
Um, so we have there's a bucket height,
Um, so we have there's a bucket height,
correct? There's a bucket height, bucket
correct? There's a bucket height, bucket
width, length.
width, length.
at bucket
V. But right now, this just lets you put
V. But right now, this just lets you put
the bucket up and put the bucket down.
So this can
be can take down a meter.
So now the bucket has a min and a max
So now the bucket has a min and a max
height.
height.
What do you think happens to the mesh
What do you think happens to the mesh
code when you start setting things to
code when you start setting things to
zero?
zero?
The mesh
The mesh
code? What do you mean?
code? What do you mean?
I guess in my mind I always thought I
I guess in my mind I always thought I
guess that we're just setting.
Are we just now going to lower the
Are we just now going to lower the
point? You think?
No. By a specific delta.
Okay.
So we do like
bucket
fine. This I guess is in cubic units.
fine. This I guess is in cubic units.
Let's say it can take one cubic meter.
Okay. So now what we have to do is
Okay. So now what we have to do is
basically we have to figure out the
basically we have to figure out the
intersection. So here's what I'm
intersection. So here's what I'm
thinking, right? We have to figure out
thinking, right? We have to figure out
the intersection of like where this
the intersection of like where this
bucket is. The bucket is just a thing
bucket is. The bucket is just a thing
that's stuck out in front of the dozer
that's stuck out in front of the dozer
and it's at some height. All right.
and it's at some height. All right.
Yeah. So then what we do is we figure
Yeah. So then what we do is we figure
out the difference between the height of
out the difference between the height of
the terrain there and the height of the
the terrain there and the height of the
bucket to figure out how much it
bucket to figure out how much it
scoops.
scoops.
Um or honestly we can just Yeah. I
Um or honestly we can just Yeah. I
think. Yeah, that's probably what we
think. Yeah, that's probably what we
should do is we should like Yeah. figure
should do is we should like Yeah. figure
out how much it scoops and then like
out how much it scoops and then like
decrease the height there and put it
decrease the height there and put it
into the bucket
into the bucket
capacity and then like if the bucket is
capacity and then like if the bucket is
angled down or whatever then instead it
angled down or whatever then instead it
drops dirt.
Do you want to hold off on the notion of
Do you want to hold off on the notion of
once the bucket is full it can't move
once the bucket is full it can't move
like keep getting dirt?
I mean it doesn't matter. Like what'll
I mean it doesn't matter. Like what'll
happen is it'll keep driving but it
happen is it'll keep driving but it
won't like cut any more dirt out which
won't like cut any more dirt out which
is like not fully accurate but it's not
is like not fully accurate but it's not
that bad.
Yeah. Yeah. Cuz we're not going to
Yeah. Yeah. Cuz we're not going to
handle like collision like impact of
handle like collision like impact of
terrain physics. We decided we're just
terrain physics. We decided we're just
going to subtract, right? Yeah. And
going to subtract, right? Yeah. And
literally once we get like the basics of
literally once we get like the basics of
this, we can already train like basics
this, we can already train like basics
of this and some mobs, we can already
of this and some mobs, we can already
train agents cuz like the reward
train agents cuz like the reward
function is super easy and we can just
function is super easy and we can just
like make the target map
like make the target map
flat, right? Um, you have to put you
flat, right? Um, you have to put you
can't do it flat because you have to put
can't do it flat because you have to put
um you have to put an area to be flat.
um you have to put an area to be flat.
You can't do the whole map flat.
You can't do the whole map flat.
Well, yeah. You're not going to be able
Well, yeah. You're not going to be able
to because the dirt isn't going to be
to because the dirt isn't going to be
the right amount. But like Yeah, you got
the right amount. But like Yeah, you got
to put dirt somewhere, right? Yeah, but
to put dirt somewhere, right? Yeah, but
we'll just give them a thousand steps to
we'll just give them a thousand steps to
make it as flat as they
can. They just get reward for matching
can. They just get reward for matching
the height map at specific points,
the height map at specific points,
right? Yeah. Yeah. No, I follow that.
right? Yeah. Yeah. No, I follow that.
Like I think we can honestly like we can
Like I think we can honestly like we can
probably have agents doing this within a
probably have agents doing this within a
couple of hours if we uh if we don't get
couple of hours if we uh if we don't get
too hung up on the logic for this little
too hung up on the logic for this little
bit.
bit.
Okay. Yeah. I mean the goal is kind of
Okay. Yeah. I mean the goal is kind of
just like get get something going and
just like get get something going and
then we can come back and argue about
then we can come back and argue about
like proper Oh yeah. handling of things
like proper Oh yeah. handling of things
later. Well, I think the first goal is
later. Well, I think the first goal is
to get something that's cool that like
to get something that's cool that like
looks like it's approximately doing the
looks like it's approximately doing the
right thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
So yeah, now this is the the obnoxious
So yeah, now this is the the obnoxious
part.
part.
So we need to figure
out No, it can't be that bad cuz all
out No, it can't be that bad cuz all
it's just a bunch of offsets. Like you
it's just a bunch of offsets. Like you
you can set up a fixed offset of the
you can set up a fixed offset of the
shape of the bucket. Yeah. So but here's
shape of the bucket. Yeah. So but here's
the thing, right? So we have
the thing, right? So we have
look. All right. So we have
look. All right. So we have
just do it in we'll just do it
here. So like here's your
dozer and like it's at some angle. So
dozer and like it's at some angle. So
we're just modeling the bucket as like
we're just modeling the bucket as like
this this thing here. Okay. And then
this this thing here. Okay. And then
internally like there's a grid. You can
internally like there's a grid. You can
see that this blueprint paper has a
see that this blueprint paper has a
grid, right? So like what we want to do
grid, right? So like what we want to do
is we want to like iterate
is we want to like iterate
over these tiles here.
over these tiles here.
Okay. And then we can take dirt from
them. So how do we do this
portion? If this were axis aligned, it
portion? If this were axis aligned, it
would be really easy. So, it's just a
would be really easy. So, it's just a
rotation instead of it being axis
rotation instead of it being axis
aligned, right?
What do you mean by that?
What do you mean by that?
So, like if this line if it if the if
So, like if this line if it if the if
the robot like if the dozer were just
the robot like if the dozer were just
like this, it would just be these cells,
like this, it would just be these cells,
right? We would literally just be able
right? We would literally just be able
to calculate super easy.
to calculate super easy.
It should just be the cells directly in
It should just be the cells directly in
front of it and then Yeah. So, how do we
front of it and then Yeah. So, how do we
calc the cells directly in front of it?
I mean, dum dum way is just
I mean, dum dum way is just
automatically subtract the current
automatically subtract the current
height by some fixed amount. No, it's
height by some fixed amount. No, it's
not the height. The height isn't the
not the height. The height isn't the
problem. The height is that the dozer is
problem. The height is that the dozer is
it's like at an angle,
it's like at an angle,
right? So, we need like how do we
right? So, we need like how do we
determine what cell is in front of it?
Well, that's a movement thing right now,
Well, that's a movement thing right now,
right? Because we have no Z, right? So
right? Because we have no Z, right? So
it's just like X. We're all just running
it's just like X. We're all just running
around in XY. So we have no angle of
around in XY. So we have no angle of
like No, but there's an angle on the 2D
like No, but there's an angle on the 2D
plane, right? So like these cubes are
plane, right? So like these cubes are
tiny or like they're small cubes, but
tiny or like they're small cubes, but
like there are like many cubes in front
like there are like many cubes in front
of the
of the
bulldozer. Like how do we iterate over
Can we just
like I don't know if we'll miss cubes
like I don't know if we'll miss cubes
and stuff doing this, but can we just
and stuff doing this, but can we just
like kind of hard to do like it's we
like kind of hard to do like it's we
need to do like the intersection of this
need to do like the intersection of this
line with the cube somehow.
The part that's tripping me out is
The part that's tripping me out is
like the map itself is still just like a
like the map itself is still just like a
2D array and then you have the height
2D array and then you have the height
map telling you where things technically
map telling you where things technically
are. But if you're saying we're now
are. But if you're saying we're now
adding like a particle component, this
adding like a particle component, this
has nothing to do with the height. The
has nothing to do with the height. The
problem here has nothing to do with the
problem here has nothing to do with the
height. So this grid like you see this
height. So this grid like you see this
is on blueprint paper, right? Yeah.
is on blueprint paper, right? Yeah.
Okay. Okay. So, you see that this the
Okay. Okay. So, you see that this the
bulldozer intersects with some grid
bulldozer intersects with some grid
cells.
cells.
Yes. How do we figure that intersection
Yes. How do we figure that intersection
out?
I just don't feel can't
I just don't feel can't
you you know because you it's just a
you you know because you it's just a
fixed number. Like I don't know what you
fixed number. Like I don't know what you
mean. like this. You you you'll know
mean. like this. You you you'll know
based off of the width and the length of
based off of the width and the length of
the bucket how many cells it's actively
the bucket how many cells it's actively
touching. Well, that's what we need to
touching. Well, that's what we need to
figure out. That's the math that we have
figure out. That's the math that we have
to figure out right now. Right.
It's some basic intersection
It's some basic intersection
calculation. I just don't know what it
calculation. I just don't know what it
is.
is.
Are you trying to do a line
Are you trying to do a line
intersection?
intersection?
It's either going to be a line or a
It's either going to be a line or a
rectangle, right?
just do two line intersections in the
just do two line intersections in the
front and the back or on all sides or
front and the back or on all sides or
whatever.
Um I would think well what's the easiest
Um I would think well what's the easiest
one to do? Is there is it an easier is
one to do? Is there is it an easier is
there like an easy formula for is this
there like an easy formula for is this
cube touching this line segment or is
cube touching this line segment or is
this cube touching like slash inside of
this cube touching like slash inside of
this rectangle? Like what's the easiest
this rectangle? Like what's the easiest
formula? U I use one in GPU drive. All
formula? U I use one in GPU drive. All
right.
I have a line intersection
thing. It's how I do
collisions. Check line intersection. You
collisions. Check line intersection. You
you're calculating
you're calculating
vectors and finding if they're parallel
vectors and finding if they're parallel
with each other. Yeah.
box generally has the easier formula.
Okay. So, it's the A. It is the
AAB. Oh, hold on. I need to mute you on
AAB. Oh, hold on. I need to mute you on
stream. All right. There we go.
So I think this is it right
So I think this is it right
here. Right.
here. Right.
Mhm. So this is this gives you the
Mhm. So this is this gives you the
points of uh the bucket. So this gives
you this gives you the cords of the
you this gives you the cords of the
bucket.
I mean this is literally just
I mean this is literally just
like this is a standard intersection
like this is a standard intersection
calculation. I just don't know what it
calculation. I just don't know what it
is.
is.
So this is giving you the min and the
So this is giving you the min and the
max. And then
Oh yeah. So all we have to do here right
is Okay. So I think this is not that
is Okay. So I think this is not that
bad.
Um, all right. So, we have the dozer X,
Um, all right. So, we have the dozer X,
the dozer Y.
the dozer Y.
Here we actually want to do this before
Here we actually want to do this before
anything. So, like the first thing we do
anything. So, like the first thing we do
is we
dig. So,
You're starting off by getting the
You're starting off by getting the
coordinates of the bucket. Yeah. Yeah.
coordinates of the bucket. Yeah. Yeah.
So,
So,
it's uh the X on the bucket min
it's uh the X on the bucket min
is So, it's dozer
X. Well, [ __ ] We have to go in front.
X. Well, [ __ ] We have to go in front.
It has to be in front of the heading,
It has to be in front of the heading,
right? So it's
right? So it's
like
like
bucket CX
bucket CX
equals Yeah, like that, right? Or and
equals Yeah, like that, right? Or and
it's dozer. I guess it's bucket offset.
Yeah, there should be a bucket
Yeah, there should be a bucket
offset meters.
Are you describing the offset of the
Are you describing the offset of the
bucket to be the the back of the bucket
bucket to be the the back of the bucket
or the front of the bucket? Uh center.
Okay. So then, okay. So you have this,
Okay. So then, okay. So you have this,
right? So this is your center and then
right? So this is your center and then
this is xmin is bucket
cx
cx
minus the bucket width and bucket
minus the bucket width and bucket
height, I guess.
height, I guess.
got
got
like fine bucket
width like 2 m or 2.5 m bucket length I
width like 2 m or 2.5 m bucket length I
don't
Yeah, it should be divided by
Yeah, it should be divided by
two because if you're using the center
point Oh, wait.
point Oh, wait.
Minus
plus my min is c y minus
plus my min is c y minus
this
plus. And we're going to have to like
plus. And we're going to have to like
draw all these things, I'm sure. Right.
draw all these things, I'm sure. Right.
Oh, for sure.
Oh, for sure.
Otherwise, we'll have no idea like where
Otherwise, we'll have no idea like where
the thing is.
the thing is.
Okay. So now we have so we get the
bucket bucket a
bucket bucket a
b and
then now we can just iterate from xmin
then now we can just iterate from xmin
xmax y min yax
xmax y min yax
right and then we have to do the test.
right and then we have to do the test.
Are you doing a just a big comparison to
Are you doing a just a big comparison to
make sure it's inside of the range?
make sure it's inside of the range?
Yeah. And also, this is not in the
Yeah. And also, this is not in the
correct units either because this width
correct units either because this width
now is in it's in like grid cell units
now is in it's in like grid cell units
or whatever. I think
I thought you just
I thought you just
[Music]
What is the base unit we're using for
What is the base unit we're using for
the
land? Are we calling it
uh the base unit? Yeah, we we haven't
uh the base unit? Yeah, we we haven't
like fixed it correctly. It's got to be
like fixed it correctly. It's got to be
like scaled.
Now we have to do we have to do the the
Now we have to do we have to do the the
check to see if it's in there.
You know what? Why don't we just like
You know what? Why don't we just like
This is kind of dumb. We should What we
This is kind of dumb. We should What we
should probably just do initially right
should probably just do initially right
here. We can get the bucket scoop
here. We can get the bucket scoop
aligned afterwards, right? Can't we just
aligned afterwards, right? Can't we just
like
Yeah. Okay. So, now we're just we have
Yeah. Okay. So, now we're just we have
the we have the thing that's in front of
the we have the thing that's in front of
the dozer and we're just going to take a
the dozer and we're just going to take a
chunk out of
there. So, like
Are you just going to subtract it? Yeah,
Are you just going to subtract it? Yeah,
I think so.
I think so.
I don't understand what's going on in
I don't understand what's going on in
this double for loop. Well, we need to
this double for loop. Well, we need to
go over all this. Like, so what I did
go over all this. Like, so what I did
here is I just I was lazy because I
here is I just I was lazy because I
don't know how to do this freaking map
don't know how to do this freaking map
initially. So I just did this. So here's
initially. So I just did this. So here's
your dozer. Here's your your dozer,
your dozer. Here's your your dozer,
right? So I just did this. All right.
right? So I just did this. All right.
This is what you're
scooping.
See? So I didn't tilt it.
That makes sense or no?
That makes sense or no?
Okay. So, you just
scooped a 4x4.
scooped a 4x4.
Uh, I think it's a 5x5, but yeah.
All
right. So now we have load and capacity
right. So now we have load and capacity
here.
Um now what do we do? We
do
Something like
Something like
this. Add the load.
Okay, that's kind of how we take terrain
Okay, that's kind of how we take terrain
out,
out,
right?
Basically, this is I feel like the
Basically, this is I feel like the
bucket height men delta math
is questionable.
is questionable.
is definitely questionable
is definitely questionable
cuz okay so you're you're taking in each
cuz okay so you're you're taking in each

today. Cool. Uh yeah,
I've I think we are close to

for us.
for us.
Um and the LP is just not doing

Lovely. It works on the uh on the map.
Lovely. It works on the uh on the map.
It like does it do you still have the
It like does it do you still have the

solved it helps or not really?
So I have the thing where it where it
So I have the thing where it where it
wasn't full solve it helps on the older
wasn't full solve it helps on the older
version of the
version of the

code. Um but once we did optimization of
both the code and the
both the code and the
hyperparameters it's breaking even.
hyperparameters it's breaking even.
So it's not hurting but it's not
So it's not hurting but it's not
helping. Correct.
I mean, it's possible that our base
I mean, it's possible that our base
algorithm is just really good, right? I

I I think that is true,
I I think that is true,
which would make sense considering that
which would make sense considering that
we're kind of sodaing everything out of
we're kind of sodaing everything out of
the box. Yeah.
Um, now I do think there are more ways
Um, now I do think there are more ways
to slice and dice the LPing that
to slice and dice the LPing that
eventually we might find a setting where
eventually we might find a setting where
it helps
it helps
and where that really brings down to

So uh and then I was briefly chatting
So uh and then I was briefly chatting
with it's not that crazy like the thing
with it's not that crazy like the thing
is it's kind of like we have a sort of a

It's similar. Yes. But a little bit

these maps are big enough and complex
these maps are big enough and complex
enough that it's like it's it's almost
enough that it's like it's it's almost
like what you get with neural 3 where
like what you get with neural 3 where
well that's why I said it should be like
well that's why I said it should be like
you know you have a map that has like a
you know you have a map that has like a

if you scale on that there should be
if you scale on that there should be
some disparity.
some disparity.
Yeah. So, I did that scaling as well.
Yeah. So, I did that scaling as well.
And
And
uh having tons of objects made the game
uh having tons of objects made the game
really easy. Yes,
really easy. Yes,
that's expected. That's the easy
that's expected. That's the easy

the curves are all getting to what I
the curves are all getting to what I

Oh, but is it actually solving like the
Oh, but is it actually solving like the
single because like you'd have to
single because like you'd have to
actually see the agents running around
actually see the agents running around
to go find the single resource converter
to go find the single resource converter
or

whatever they do that. Um, so I haven't
whatever they do that. Um, so I haven't
done any like I haven't taken a hard

you should look at because the thing is

we just full solve their end. So like
we just full solve their end. So like
then it's like yeah guys you have to
then it's like yeah guys you have to
like add more stuff now. We full solved

Okay.
Okay.

Uh why? I forgot to sign something. Ah,
very fun. And so I just I need to take
very fun. And so I just I need to take

withholding on any of this stuff. So
you're responsible for that. That's in
you're responsible for that. That's in

So, this is half of it, right? Like the
So, this is half of it, right? Like the
other half is the uh unloading.
I was still tripping about how you did
I was still tripping about how you did
this because like if that's now the map
this because like if that's now the map
height plus the thing is the bottom of
height plus the thing is the bottom of
the bucket and you're just subtracting
the bucket and you're just subtracting
the map height minus the thing you just
the map height minus the thing you just
subtracted from.
I don't know if I did it right. I just I
I don't know if I did it right. I just I
did
something cuz you effectively just did
something cuz you effectively just did
dozer bucket height minus bucket minus
Yeah, delta is just dozer bucket height.
Delta or rather negative dozer bucket
Delta or rather negative dozer bucket

delta is basically just negative dozer
delta is basically just negative dozer
bucket height with the current
bucket height with the current
math. You do map height minus map height

minus dozer bucket height.

Delta should just doer bucket height.
Yeah, it should literally just
Yeah, it should literally just
be uh dozer. That's just negative dozer
be uh dozer. That's just negative dozer

I'm not saying that's correct. I'm just
I'm not saying that's correct. I'm just

saying that's what you have right now.
So if dozer bucket height is greater
So if dozer bucket height is greater
than

zero, this This
Oh, no, wait. It's literally just
Oh, no, wait. It's literally just
doesn't bucket always be greater than
doesn't bucket always be greater than

number of
Dang it. I No, I'm doing the math
Dang it. I No, I'm doing the math
totally wrong, but here it's supposed to
totally wrong, but here it's supposed to
be something
like I'm totally screwing this thing up.

It should be map height minus bucket

adjustable.
Well, isn't it created from or is that

right like
This is going to return a copy. Don't

want

this right in Python. on.
what do we think about digging some? I
what do we think about digging some? I
think like this basic thing will work
think like this basic thing will work
and then we'll have to do there like
and then we'll have to do there like
several more things we have to do
several more things we have to do
obviously, but
obviously, but
um I at least want to see the terrain be

adjustable.
And all these mesh like these have to
And all these mesh like these have to
all
be right.
There's so
many. I mean, like, I could bother to
many. I mean, like, I could bother to
like figure out how to do this
like figure out how to do this
programmatically, but like how often do
programmatically, but like how often do
I have to do this Really?
lies back from the dead.
and almost
and almost
done. So,
done. So,
um I don't know. We're going to have to
um I don't know. We're going to have to
get like the axis align version of it
get like the axis align version of it
obviously, but like we should pretty
obviously, but like we should pretty
quickly start to see like something that
quickly start to see like something that
actually looks like
um yeah, something that actually looks
um yeah, something that actually looks
like a digging sim. Pretty much as soon
like a digging sim. Pretty much as soon
as this code is correct.
Keep overflow.
What did I do wrong here? This obvious?
What did I do wrong here? This obvious?
Um, size of mesh should not be a
Um, size of mesh should not be a
pointer. It should just be size of mesh.
pointer. It should just be size of mesh.
Okay.
Okay.
Yep. And then this gives you a pointer
Yep. And then this gives you a pointer
to it
here. Maybe that'll
work. All right. Well, the mesh got
work. All right. Well, the mesh got
[ __ ] No.
Trying to reload an already loaded
mesh. Okay.
You want to load the mesh in the make
client.
client.
Um well this has to you need to call
Um well this has to you need to call
this to synchronize the data I believe.
What does upload mesh
do? I like I guess are you not allowed
do? I like I guess are you not allowed
to call this thing multiple times?
Okay. So, you're not allowed to recall
Okay. So, you're not allowed to recall
this apparently.
I only call it once.
Oh, what if you just call update height
Oh, what if you just call update height
map
map
mesh one time the beginning to see if it
mesh one time the beginning to see if it
it still works?
it still works?
This works.
Maybe you just take it, but it's very
Maybe you just take it, but it's very
slow.
slow.
But I think that this is
update.
You could give
You could give
it just the cells that you're updating.
it just the cells that you're updating.
Maybe you give it just the cells. It's
Maybe you give it just the cells. It's
not like there's something wrong with
not like there's something wrong with
it. It doesn't like that I'm calling
this trying to load reload an already

I uh I don't know how you're supposed to
I uh I don't know how you're supposed to
do this.
I don't think what we should do with
I don't think what we should do with
this.
Like we have to make a new mesh. Is that
Like we have to make a new mesh. Is that
what it is?
You think kill a mesh make a mesh every

time? I don't freaking know, I guess.
Let me
see. We Let's say that we put this
see. We Let's say that we put this
here. Mhm.
Okay, so this runs. It's like uploading
Okay, so this runs. It's like uploading
the mesh constantly. It
the mesh constantly. It
runs probably leaking
runs probably leaking
memory. That does run
memory. That does run
though. So, can we see if
though. So, can we see if
um I can't tell if anything is actually
um I can't tell if anything is actually
decreasing?
Maybe forcibly set all bucket height or
Maybe forcibly set all bucket height or
tilts to positive so that you know
tilts to positive so that you know
everything should
be dropping in height. I think we're
be dropping in height. I think we're
going to just do
um this
I think I got to go get my old chair.
I think I got to go get my old chair.
This This is freaking killing my neck
This This is freaking killing my neck
being like down this low. Hang on.
All
right.
Okay. So, where's our
Okay. So, where's our
uh where are our
uh where are our
dozers? Oh, they're underneath the map
dozers? Oh, they're underneath the map
cuz the map height is getting set to

Oh, cuz they're driving right on top of

the zero they just set. Oh, no. Wait,
they are. Look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This
they are. Look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This
is
editing. I definitely saw it editing.

Yeah.
I can't really
tell. Definitely is. Look.
It's definitely cutting it
down. The
down. The
canyons will make it super
obvious. Ultra powered dozer.
there.
See? See that?
See? See that?
I'm still behind a couple seconds. So,
I'm still behind a couple seconds. So,
just let me
just let me
see. Definitely doing it.
see. Definitely doing it.
I think it's making a cannon now. Canyon
I think it's making a cannon now. Canyon
now, right? Yeah. Look at this.
now, right? Yeah. Look at this.
Okay. Yeah, it is.
All right.
All right.
So, now we have to fix things.
Um, yeah, we got to fix some things.
Let's see if that's
Let's see if that's
errors. Should be stable now
errors. Should be stable now
maybe. Yeah, look at that. This
maybe. Yeah, look at that. This
cannoning.
That's totally making canyons, right?
That's totally making canyons, right?
Yeah, I think so.
Honestly, why don't we just
Honestly, why don't we just
like fix this thing up, add some OB
like fix this thing up, add some OB
spaces, and see if we can get it to
spaces, and see if we can get it to
flatten everything.
Yeah, that'd be a simple task.
Yeah, that'd be a simple task.
Leaking tons of memory.
Leaking tons of memory.
Oh, yeah. We haven't freed literally
Oh, yeah. We haven't freed literally
anything. Yeah. Well, the model is
anything. Yeah. Well, the model is
allocating, I think, every time. We have
allocating, I think, every time. We have
to figure out the mesh thing.
But anyways, let's get um let's get this
But anyways, let's get um let's get this
thing some OBS and actions and like
thing some OBS and actions and like
train some train some things, huh? Yeah,
train some train some things, huh? Yeah,
because it can be set to a just keep
because it can be set to a just keep
keep that action the way it
is or the way that like that dynamic the
is or the way that like that dynamic the
the dirt loading dynamic is and it
the dirt loading dynamic is and it
should be fine enough to flatten the
should be fine enough to flatten the
whole world. Mhm.
We can just do like this is plus.0. I
We can just do like this is plus.0. I
mean, this is iterating over a 100
mean, this is iterating over a 100
tiles. This is probably too big, huh?
Well, this is where it's like a little
Well, this is where it's like a little
unclear to me about the map dimensions
unclear to me about the map dimensions
versus
like map dimension versus vehicle
like map dimension versus vehicle
dimension in the realm of the cell.
This is your reward tier.
This is your reward tier.
I guess arguably you could say a cell is
I guess arguably you could say a cell is
just one meter or whatever one unit of
just one meter or whatever one unit of
anything. Yeah, it can't be a meter cuz
anything. Yeah, it can't be a meter cuz
that's too big,
that's too big,
right? But
right? But
anyways, compute observations.
Um, just a window. Yeah, around itself.
Um, just a window. Yeah, around itself.
Maybe offset forward a little bit.
initially.
Yeah. I don't know. You want to make
Yeah. I don't know. You want to make
like 9 10 x 10
window.
Um, yeah, I think we do.
And then what's that? Uh the annoying
And then what's that? Uh the annoying
trick
This 111
on. Okay.
I guess you have to get current cell and
I guess you have to get current cell and
then index offset.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um I think we should just do
like that
maybe.
maybe.
Okay, that's
Okay, that's
it. Um,
it. Um,
and then we just do if pick
is x *
x. Wait, that makes no sense. That just
x. Wait, that makes no sense. That just
sets up a a thing around unless are you
sets up a a thing around unless are you
trying to make the map really small.
trying to make the map really small.
What are you What's here? What?
What are you What's here? What?
In your compute observations.
In your compute observations.
Uh yeah, that's totally wrong.
Yeah, that makes no sense at all. Huh.
Yeah, that makes no sense at all. Huh.
Yeah, it should be based off of the
Yeah, it should be based off of the
agent X.
agent X.
Can we just get the like
Can we just get the like
just get just get the agent and then do
just get just get the agent and then do
agent X time M size plus Y. Agent
Y. It was so damn easy when I did it
Y. It was so damn easy when I did it
here. What the [ __ ]
What do I do
What do I do
here? Our offset
This is
This is
I times
That's it. Like it's all we need.
Where did you set vision?
Where did you set vision?
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah, that should
work. I want to get like an agent
work. I want to get like an agent
training
already. Okay. And we have to call this
already. Okay. And we have to call this
inc, right?
Yes. And reset. And
reset.
reset.
Cool. So now we
um did you give it rewards?
um did you give it rewards?
I
I
think this Yeah, I gave it rewards.
Um, I guess we have to make a config for

this thing.
You leave whatever defaults are
You leave whatever defaults are
in any of
this. Oh, we have to like rebuild as
this. Oh, we have to like rebuild as
well.
Uh yeah, for sure. And then you got to
Uh yeah, for sure. And then you got to
delete the thing and do the whole
thing. And then copy
thing. And then copy
the file from the build.
We don't have logs at all.
Terraform has
no
no
[ __ ] This is no longer here, guys. like
[ __ ] This is no longer here, guys. like
is it's caching some [ __ ] I think.
is it's caching some [ __ ] I think.
Oh no, I'm dumb.
Map size doesn't exist. I thought it's
Map size doesn't exist. I thought it's
just size.
Yeah, but I think you still have to copy
Yeah, but I think you still have to copy
the file over.
Okay. So, I don't know if it does
Okay. So, I don't know if it does
anything or not.
Why is it not um showing any SP like
Why is it not um showing any SP like
steps or anything? Cuz I don't know.
steps or anything? Cuz I don't know.
Something's
wrong. Uh we probably can't use back in
wrong. Uh we probably can't use back in
it because it's multi- aent.
That's probably it.
That's probably it.
Yo, I don't know why it doesn't give us
Yo, I don't know why it doesn't give us
an error when we do that.
You got to do the offset thing, right?
You got to do the offset thing, right?
Yes.
That's nice. So, we actually do get
Where's this thing like
hanging? Not here.
Are you stepping at all? I'm figuring
out. Okay, so this thing segs. Lovely.
We never freed
anything right
here. The pearl and
noise. Oh, I guess we didn't
pass. This is supposed to be map size.
I already had that.
I already had that.
What? That doesn't make any goddamn
What? That doesn't make any goddamn
sense at
all. This is Does this call a net? Does
all. This is Does this call a net? Does
this not get
called? I think we have to call a nit in
called? I think we have to call a nit in
our binding, don't
we? Yeah, you
do. We normally have a Mayait inside the
do. We normally have a Mayait inside the
binding
sea. Yeah, I should be
good. Oh, you're going to have to do all
good. Oh, you're going to have to do all
the whole thing
again. Where's the freaking path?
Super
annoying. Are you looking for the delete
annoying. Are you looking for the delete
build
build
command?
This feels like Fter now.
Now I can't tell if it's just taking
Now I can't tell if it's just taking
forever or hanging or
what.
Okay. Oh, there we
Okay. Oh, there we
go. Okay. So,
uh, by with the serial back end without

GDB taking making everything take
GDB taking making everything take
forever.
It lowkey takes a while. Mhm.
I feel Well, this is just 168. This just
I feel Well, this is just 168. This just
gave us 168 million steps all at
gave us 168 million steps all at
once. Something's weird there,
right? Uh, batch size
probably. M number m is 512.
Something's great with our batch size.
Okay, so it's spawning a massive
Okay, so it's spawning a massive
freaking number of total agents for some
reason. What's your

matter. Oh, wait. What? It's doing

262144 on from numbum

I feel like it shouldn't though. Why
I feel like it shouldn't though. Why
would it be so bad?
would it be so bad?
It's generating like 512 512 x 512 pland

freeing anything. So, we freed zero.
freeing anything. So, we freed zero.
Thanks,
Okay. So, I mean this was like doing
Okay. So, I mean this was like doing
something and then
whatever. It's stuck. There no freaking
whatever. It's stuck. There no freaking

while loops
like stuff should not be able to get

It's crazy it takes that long though,
It's crazy it takes that long though,
right? That's what I'm saying.
right? That's what I'm saying.
I mean, I guess you are doing a for loop
I mean, I guess you are doing a for loop
through whatever 512 512 is 250,000 or
through whatever 512 512 is 250,000 or
whatever. It shouldn't be that much.
Would you say this is about as long as
Would you say this is about as long as
it takes neural MMO to
it takes neural MMO to
load? No, we uh we only have a couple of

Okay. What if you It's a hack because
Okay. What if you It's a hack because
you're already doing 512 agents, right?
you're already doing 512 agents, right?
And you're doing random on the start the

Why not just store the map, the initial
Why not just store the map, the initial

do
that cuz you're already going to have 40
that cuz you're already going to have 40
96 random instances anyways.
like
this.
this.
Yeah, I think that should speed things
Yeah, I think that should speed things
up.
We're going to have even more memory
We're going to have even more memory
leaks,

though. That shouldn't leak anything.
Uhhuh.
Uhhuh.
Okay. So, this now runs their
Okay. So, this now runs their
multipprocessing bug. Anyways,
multipprocessing bug. Anyways,
you're on serial.
you're on serial.
So, if I just do this, it should work as

well.
well.
You just got to have change numbum
You just got to have change numbum

you have enough workers. I don't know
you have enough workers. I don't know

okay. It wasn't reporting any stats.
okay. It wasn't reporting any stats.
Well, we didn't log.

We can do that on

right? You can do like this,
right? You can do like this,
right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
But we need
But we need
um there needs to be like a reward or
um there needs to be like a reward or

right
here. Okay, so this is
here. Okay, so this is
fine. We have end for

You're going to have to copy the file

All
right. So,
is it going?
is it going?
Yeah, it's going.
Stats are going infinitely up.
Stats are going infinitely up.
Well, how how do we get this to work
Well, how how do we get this to work
with multipprocessing?
right back.
We'll see what the heck these bots
do, but then we should get this thing
do, but then we should get this thing
training faster.
Oh, it's going. Well, no. Actually, we
Oh, it's going. Well, no. Actually, we
shouldn't have to set reset our logs.
what this is.
All right, I'm back. Did you figure out

Um, no.
What are you What are you doing? You

going to try and eval this or something?
Uh, I don't know if this is the right

It probably
is. Okay, I got to kill this fly because

it's like I'm getting like increasingly
it's like I'm getting like increasingly
angry and it has nothing to do with this
angry and it has nothing to do with this

literally can't tell if it's there or

God, like awful.
You already have one of those uh like
You already have one of those uh like

I didn't hell.
What? It's It's confict [ __ ]

So we have some [ __ ] in this end
apparently. Do we try to run the uh the

actually get our model to run?
Yeah. You want to push me what we have?
Yeah. You want to push me what we have?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Actually, I'm going to just push

you some things and go fly hunting.
F sanitize is in there by default from

Um, it's not saying where it is, so I'm

like hunting for
it. The the issue there's one issue that

you'll have that you have already that's
you'll have that you have already that's
just uh plland noise is
just uh plland noise is
declared after it's called. So you have
declared after it's called. So you have
to put it before nit.
There's a what after you. So you know
There's a what after you. So you know
how we change pearl and noise to have
how we change pearl and noise to have
original map. Yeah, you have to put the
original map. Yeah, you have to put the
whole pearl and noise function defined
whole pearl and noise function defined
above a nit. Huh. Okay.
above a nit. Huh. Okay.
But there's still more errors
But there's still more errors
um that I'm trying to find where it is
um that I'm trying to find where it is
cuz for some reason the sanitizer is not

actually telling me

trying to compile this thing with debug
trying to compile this thing with debug
symbols so that we can actually like get

a proper trace into the C with this

It's like when I'm running the local

sometimes it doesn't.
sometimes it doesn't.
Uh, that's

What?
That is so weird. Why is it like that?
That is so weird. Why is it like that?
Okay.
I'm still trying to get us full
traces. If we could just get a trace,
traces. If we could just get a trace,
this would be easy.
or just
would say this just doesn't run which is
would say this just doesn't run which is
ridiculous.
ridiculous.
Why do why does it say I have 10
Why do why does it say I have 10
trillion leaks? Why does
this things have been free?
I don't know why.
I don't know why.
Um, like this thing just doesn't run
Um, like this thing just doesn't run
when I I uh try to load lease.
So, this is apparently the

correct thing to preload.
So this is supposed to work but in our

Maybe maybe if I run without PDB Okay.
I mean this like is erroring in PyTorch
I mean this like is erroring in PyTorch
which is not what we
I wonder if I can do
Maybe I can do Um,
No, I'm not building the torch extension
No, I'm not building the torch extension
with the uh the wrong
with the uh the wrong
arcs. It's still getting stuck like at a
arcs. It's still getting stuck like at a
weird spot.
I got it, I think.
I got it, I think.
Hang on.
Ah, yo, I found it.
Ah, yo, I found it.
What was it?
What was it?
It's um a bad mess set in uh C
reset. And let me show you the command
reset. And let me show you the command
that I had to run to get this to [ __ ]
that I had to run to get this to [ __ ]
work.
Yeah, it works
now. Okay. So,
now. Okay. So,
uh, did you push your stuff?
uh, did you push your stuff?
No. Okay, push your stuff. I found the
No. Okay, push your stuff. I found the
bug and I importantly I we're never
bug and I importantly I we're never
going to have this problem again.
Let me give you the command. Wait, I
Let me give you the command. Wait, I
think I did push my stuff already to
think I did push my stuff already to
you.
This is how I had to run it.
This is how I had to run it.
Did you put that in chat or something?
Did you put that in chat or something?
Or did you Yeah.
I also had to compile with debug. I'm
I also had to compile with debug. I'm
going to push my
going to push my
stuff. So now we no longer have to
stuff. So now we no longer have to
guess. Like literally, this wasn't even
guess. Like literally, this wasn't even
C being hard or anything. This was just
C being hard or anything. This was just
straight up the Python binds [ __ ]
straight up the Python binds [ __ ]
like not giving us error
messages. All
right. So now we have it.
Yeah. So we should be
good. I think so.
So now I
hopefully I can do it the fast version.
I still think the ops floats thing is
I still think the ops floats thing is
still possibly an issue. But what are

It doesn't like M size times M size.
That's not how big OBS are.

Okay. Okay. And that's what this new
Okay. Okay. And that's what this new
command is. You have to rebuild with um
command is. You have to rebuild with um
LD like the whatever.
Dude, this is a long command. Holy.
Dude, this is a long command. Holy.
Yeah, I it took some uh some
figuring. Okay, so here we go. Here are
figuring. Okay, so here we go. Here are
dozers. All right, they're
dozers. All right, they're
dozing. Now we can rerun
training. Maybe we can actually run
training. Maybe we can actually run
training correctly.
I still have some weird [ __ ] where it's
I still have some weird [ __ ] where it's
uh like spawning two instances of render
uh like spawning two instances of render
for some reason at the start as well. I
for some reason at the start as well. I
don't know what's up with that.
Not quite sure how that's happening.
See if it still just hangs.
Did you get the multiprocessing thing to
Did you get the multiprocessing thing to
work now? Uh, I don't know. I'm running
work now? Uh, I don't know. I'm running
it. It doesn't seem to be doing stuff
it. It doesn't seem to be doing stuff
yet,
yet,
but Oh.
Okay. Yeah. So, now it
Okay. Yeah. So, now it
goes. It takes a heck of a
goes. It takes a heck of a
while. Now we're at uh almost a million
SPS. So we'll see if this gives us
SPS. So we'll see if this gives us
anything different, I
guess. It also should not just be going
guess. It also should not just be going
up and up and up, I don't think.
up and up and up, I don't think.
Right. Uh
Right. Uh
Why wouldn't it just go up and up and up
Why wouldn't it just go up and up and up
and up and up? It's getting rewarded
and up and up? It's getting rewarded
every time it basically moves.
every time it basically moves.
Okay, then we should actually see it
Okay, then we should actually see it
consistently like doing better.
It should be. Yeah, it should just go up
It should be. Yeah, it should just go up
until there's nothing left to
flatten. Assuming it actually trains.
flatten. Assuming it actually trains.
Oh yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, we also have to
like this is very silly, but
um can't pass these from the CLI at the
um can't pass these from the CLI at the

this like it passes everything as

strings.
Okay. So, they're just going in a
Okay. So, they're just going in a
circle,
man. So, yeah, they're just going in a

No, cuz they have 512 steps to collect

going up if that's all they're doing,
going up if that's all they're doing,
right? So something's
[Music]
weird. My guess may be the height map
weird. My guess may be the height map
updating. No, it's a render thing. Uh I
updating. No, it's a render thing. Uh I
just set it
just set it
to Oh, wait. This is Hang on. There's no
to Oh, wait. This is Hang on. There's no
check.
Oh, if if map height's not zero. Yeah.
Yep. That would that would be an issue.
Yep. That would that would be an issue.
All right, let's see uh if we can
All right, let's see uh if we can
recompile and actually get it to do
recompile and actually get it to do
something.
something.
I think this is going to look like
I think this is going to look like
really cool as soon as we, you know, get
really cool as soon as we, you know, get
it to do a thing. Can you figure out the
it to do a thing. Can you figure out the
um the memory leak on meshes so that we
um the memory leak on meshes so that we
can actually render without oming?
Um I'm currently trying to hunt down
Um I'm currently trying to hunt down
these like render memory leaks. Oh,
these like render memory leaks. Oh,
okay. So, you're doing it right.
So far to no avail, but I'm attempting
Well, we shall train Terraform.
It's saying they're saying that there's
It's saying they're saying that there's
so many leaks that I just don't even It
so many leaks that I just don't even It
has to all be coming from the mesh, I
has to all be coming from the mesh, I
guess, because
guess, because
everything else is freed some way
everything else is freed some way
somehow.
somehow.
Okay, I'll be right back.
All
right. I've been trained and now the
right. I've been trained and now the
agents are training.
do
this. Nope, that didn't do anything.
this. Nope, that didn't do anything.
Great.
Well, this is a more
Well, this is a more
reasonable. It's still going up very
reasonable. It's still going up very
much.
I would have thought that the max reward
I would have thought that the max reward
should be like 600.
The size of the map
512. Why? Just like if they're always
512. Why? Just like if they're always
gathering like 1.2 a step max.
We got to make this.
Okay, they
uh they're now
uh they're now
like driving around doing things kind
of. Yeah, memory leak is big though.
I have to kill it before.
I have to kill it before.
But like they're driving
around like it's definitely a different
around like it's definitely a different
learned behavior and it looks
semicoherent. So, as soon as we can like
semicoherent. So, as soon as we can like
actually do this thing, like we can
actually do this thing, like we can
probably probably get some policies and
probably probably get some policies and
then it's like fine-tuning, you know,
then it's like fine-tuning, you know,
it's a loop of fine-tuning mechanics and
it's a loop of fine-tuning mechanics and
training agents,
right? That could be pretty
right? That could be pretty
legit. This could actually be pretty
legit. This could actually be pretty
damn good.
And I was really hope that was the thing
And I was really hope that was the thing
I fixed.
Let's see if I help you. Have you found
Let's see if I help you. Have you found
anything out with
anything out with
uh meshes mesh free whatever yet or no?
I'm pretty confident it's because we're
I'm pretty confident it's because we're
creating the height map mesh every
creating the height map mesh every
render step. Yes. But how do we free it?

I'm having a hard time figuring out
I'm having a hard time figuring out
because even if I try and free the

We'll try running locally on the thing.

I think we're going to be uh
I think we're going to be uh

Well, one thing for sure I think is

probably wrong
is line 475 and each render step you're

making another client what
making another client what
if if it's the client is null so you're

How I want to see if it curves.
If me percentage is low on on HTOP, does

Okay, now we should get a Neptune run

that actually does something and we will
that actually does something and we will
see whether curve go

If you're doing that on the C side, like
If you're doing that on the C side, like
locally rendering, you just call render

Uh, I think you still you still probably
Uh, I think you still you still probably
need to do
that. Oh yeah, that's a totally
that. Oh yeah, that's a totally
different curve.
See, now it's super low.
Is it still training right now? Mhm.
We probably need to look at
We probably need to look at
observations. We probably need to do
observations. We probably need to do
lots of stuff.
Definitely.
Yeah. Okay, I think it's time for
Yeah. Okay, I think it's time for
observation debugging. Let me push these
observation debugging. Let me push these
fixes for you. Now we actually have
logging. All
logging. All
right. There the fix is pushed and uh
right. There the fix is pushed and uh
yeah this train curve no wonder we uh
yeah this train curve no wonder we uh
are not seeing anything too amazing out

Okay, so this is our end. Uh, camera
needs to be fixed and centered. Yeah,

this is what the bots do.
Sorry, can you show that again? What the
Sorry, can you show that again? What the
bots are doing?
Um, oh, is the Twitch stream being

weird? Hold
up. All right, I can see again
now. Camera needs to be adjusted,
but I mean, they're moving
but I mean, they're moving
around. We fix Kim.

Um,
We need to find the center point of the

275 718
Okay,
Okay,
cool. It's decent.
I don't like the
um Shouldn't the target
be? Camera position could be higher up.

I think.
How do we fix this clipping plane

Something's very weird with the camera
Something's very weird with the camera

Um, cool. Uh, I will start on
Um, cool. Uh, I will start on
observations. See what's going on in
observations. See what's going on in
there.
I feel fairly confident the obs issue is
I feel fairly confident the obs issue is
going to be the float to char
going to be the float to char
thing. Could be.
I think it's the data scale.
Now you're just going to divide it by
Now you're just going to divide it by
the
the
size. M size times M size or not M size.
size. M size times M size or not M size.
But yeah, M size. Uh no, just divide by
But yeah, M size. Uh no, just divide by
M size.
M size.
Why is it by M size? It's the height.
Why is it by M size? It's the height.
It's the
issue. If I have to do
that. Okay.
So do this.
Perspective matrix.
What was the stream super far
What was the stream super far
behind? Probably comment on the camera

stuff I was doing. Well, I don't know
stuff I was doing. Well, I don't know
why the YouTube stream would be super
why the YouTube stream would be super
far
behind. That's kind of weird.
now. Graphics is
fine. Oh, this needs to get reshaped,
fine. Oh, this needs to get reshaped,
doesn't it?
Why is there comp
3D? [ __ ]
what it's not like making the right
what it's not like making the right
policy.
Oh yeah.
Don't know why it has a com 3D in there,
Don't know why it has a com 3D in there,
but
Okay, so this now works.
This needs to be
There.
Okay, so this
runs. I feel like you did that actor
runs. I feel like you did that actor
function very differently than how I did
function very differently than how I did
the GPU drive one. I'm just behind
the GPU drive one. I'm just behind
because I got I got back from three
because I got I got back from three
hours. What?
was back like Yeah. Yeah.
was back like Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. about five
minutes. All right. So, we'll see if
minutes. All right. So, we'll see if
this does anything. So, this is now uh
this does anything. So, this is now uh
data normalized
data normalized
semi-an with small com architecture.
If that makes a
difference, it does take an obnoxious
difference, it does take an obnoxious
amount of time to initialize stuff. I
amount of time to initialize stuff. I
will
say here is our latest creation.
Oh, I don't know if that's significant
Oh, I don't know if that's significant
yet.
Not
really. So,
really. So,
uh, you think it's getting reward shown
uh, you think it's getting reward shown
correctly
or is it capped out now?
or is it capped out now?
I'm still waiting to see, but I think it
I'm still waiting to see, but I think it
is. I think it's just stuck somewhere
is. I think it's just stuck somewhere
between like 50 and 60.
Do you think that's reasonable
given
given
the that we gave it? No idea.
It could be only gave it what 5 12 time

It could be.
It could be.
And what's the maximum amount of reward
And what's the maximum amount of reward
you can get per step?
you can get per step?
Well, technically 1.2, but that would
Well, technically 1.2, but that would
require you to be like your whole digger
require you to be like your whole digger
would have to be like 1.21. You'd have
would have to be like 1.21. You'd have
to have the whole digger on new soil.
How about value loss? Do we have a
Okay. So, I guess next we
Okay. So, I guess next we
like do we like do some sanity thing? Do
like do we like do some sanity thing? Do
we like sparsify the map or something?
Like what do you mean by sparify the
Like what do you mean by sparify the
map?
Like here we can
do randomly set portions to
do randomly set portions to
zero. Hang on.
Okay, this is obviously not what we
Okay, this is obviously not what we
want. What was the Do you know what the
want. What was the Do you know what the

Can you tell if there are flat bits

looks like there's a little bit of hills
looks like there's a little bit of hills
somewhere.
somewhere.
Kind of hard to
Kind of hard to
see with the way that this texture is,
see with the way that this texture is,
right?
right?
Yeah. I mean, if you want, you can draw
Yeah. I mean, if you want, you can draw
something on the render again and if
something on the render again and if
it's equal to zero, make it like, I
it's equal to zero, make it like, I
don't know, draw a cube there or
don't know, draw a cube there or
something.
We can do like this. Leave the
mountains. Okay. So now we can see it,
mountains. Okay. So now we can see it,
right? This is like sparse
mountains. What we think about
mountains. What we think about
this? Let's give it a second. Like
this? Let's give it a second. Like
catching up visually on stream.
catching up visually on stream.
We give it like something like this.
Yeah. I mean, that has like pretty clear
Yeah. I mean, that has like pretty clear
targets, right? Yep.
We also need like new textures for this
thing. Oops. I just saw the the script I
thing. Oops. I just saw the the script I
was looking for.
Okay, now we can train
again. I'm going to give you these
again. I'm going to give you these
changes as well.
Okay, I pushed these for you. I'll be
Okay, I pushed these for you. I'll be
back. Need the restroom and uh flip the
back. Need the restroom and uh flip the
thing and I'll be right back.
All right. Well, we have um a new
graph, huh?
Spencer, how's this graph?
Spencer, how's this graph?
It doesn't look good, right?
No, that does not look good.
No, that does not look good.
It doesn't look like they're like
It doesn't look like they're like
getting better
at like seeking out the
at like seeking out the
uh the stuff, right?
Oops.
Yeah. So, they're just like going around
Yeah. So, they're just like going around
and like not
and like not
really bothering to like seek out new
terrain. So, uh let's see. Are they like
they're kind of still just going in
they're kind of still just going in
circles?
Let's see what they're getting. So, they
Let's see what they're getting. So, they
get this
get this
reward and rewards of I get it's set
reward and rewards of I get it's set
to plus
0.01F. We can make
0.01F. We can make
sure like
sure like
16 times real quick.
I mean, this has some rewards,
right? These are like reasonable
right? These are like reasonable
rewards.
Yeah, I mean it's getting some. Not like
Yeah, I mean it's getting some. Not like
it's like it shouldn't be getting it
it's like it shouldn't be getting it
every single time. Well, it shouldn't
every single time. Well, it shouldn't
be, right? That's the map across all the
be, right? That's the map across all the
steps, right? Was it across all the

agents of one step? All agents of one
agents of one step? All agents of one
step. Okay. So, it's like possible.
So we have like this looks good.
Um is there possible that it's like
Um is there possible that it's like
there's some jank thing with
there's some jank thing with
multidiscreet?
Well, you did the multi-discreet action
Well, you did the multi-discreet action
different than I did in GPU drive. How'd
different than I did in GPU drive. How'd
you do it?
you do it?
Um,
it was summing the
it was summing the

and all. Where is
this? This was the actor.
Let me put it in the
Let me put it in the

Oh, I don't know if that really makes a

but I actually don't

know how I have it at the moment.
What did you do? And do you split it?
What did you do? And do you split it?
Let's see.
Split.
I do split. Yes, I split.
That's probably faster to be fair.
It just is like totally
stuck. Unless we also just look at our

hybrids at all.
You think the vision window is too

small?
I don't think so. It's But like So
I don't think so. It's But like So
there's some data there,

It's in the center of its window.
Uh, unless maybe it's not. Did we not

I think it may be the y is you're

supposed to
supposed to
multiply y offset plus y * size plus x
multiply y offset plus y * size plus x
offset plus x. We did x comma y format
offset plus x. We did x comma y format
though, which is like why I'm confused.
Yeah, it's Y time size.
Yeah, it's Y time size.
Did you drew Did you try something?

No, I just went to go look at render and
No, I just went to go look at render and

I'm wrong.
I'm wrong.
You can put it back to X time size and Y
You can put it back to X time size and Y
times Yeah.
So,
So,
like I mean something's wrong. I'm
like I mean something's wrong. I'm
pretty sure it can't
see like if I just comment the OBS out,
see like if I just comment the OBS out,
what
happens? Yeah. So, it can't see at all,
happens? Yeah. So, it can't see at all,
man.
man.
It's like the same result with the obs
It's like the same result with the obs
commented out
completely. Okay.
I'm going to try my float thing now.
seems totally fine to me.
They are driving around.
Uh, one way we can check things is we
Uh, one way we can check things is we
could draw a line. Mhm.
To the height it
To the height it
thinks things are
at. Maybe we can draw like around it, I
at. Maybe we can draw like around it, I
guess.
Can we do like like kind of like how I
Can we do like like kind of like how I
do the lasers on GPU drive?
You need to put that inside of
You need to put that inside of
the matrix, I think.
Oh, but then
Oh, but then
um then we won't get to check to see if
um then we won't get to check to see if
it's actually
like Oh, you're doing it this way. Okay,
like Oh, you're doing it this way. Okay,
it's
fine. I thought you were testing
fine. I thought you were testing
something else.
Perfect. Why is it
tilted? The
hell? Hang on.
Okay, so this is how far they think they
Okay, so this is how far they think they
can see.
Do the vision windows make sense or are
Do the vision windows make sense or are
they too tiny? They could just be tiny.
It looks like it has no way of seeing
It looks like it has no way of seeing
anything.
anything.
Well, the the vehicles are nowhere near
Well, the the vehicles are nowhere near
this big as the thing, right?
this big as the thing, right?
Like how big is this vehicle in units?
Um I think
one right can't be. Did we scale it?
Think we ever I think it just I think it
Think we ever I think it just I think it
just add its own position. I don't think
just add its own position. I don't think
we have like a size on it.
Okay. So, like that's
Whoa. This is
wrong. Quarter size
wrong. Quarter size
dozer. All right. So, there we go. So,
dozer. All right. So, there we go. So,
this is like
this is like
They're in the center of this little
They're in the center of this little
thing
now. Well, actually, maybe the dozers
now. Well, actually, maybe the dozers
are supposed to
be. I mean, this is probably very tough.
be. I mean, this is probably very tough.
Right. I think they can't see anything.
Right. I think they can't see anything.
All right. Blue
shell. Well, it's better if they can go
fast. You think this does anything?
their speed so they can explore faster.
Mhm. If not, the other thing we can do
Mhm. If not, the other thing we can do
is we can dilate the ops. I was planning
is we can dilate the ops. I was planning
on doing that
on doing that
anyways. You know what I mean?
anyways. You know what I mean?
No, I don't know what dilating off
No, I don't know what dilating off
means. All right, I'll show you. It's a
means. All right, I'll show you. It's a
cool trick.
Cuz like you don't want to make the
Cuz like you don't want to make the
window huge, right?
Ideally. Yeah.
I don't think you can
see. So like
Okay.
I think this is
it. Let's see if it Let's see what this
it. Let's see if it Let's see what this
looks like if I do it here.
Wait, is it just allowing it to have
Wait, is it just allowing it to have
gaps and go a little look further? Yep.
gaps and go a little look further? Yep.
Oh, that's kind of cool.
That's a really clever thought. Yeah.
Okay. So now you see this, you see the
Okay. So now you see this, you see the
obs are dilated.
One sec. Stream catching up.
Dilate the obs by factor four
Dilate the obs by factor four
even. And now, yeah, there you
even. And now, yeah, there you
go. Now they should be able to freaking
see
right lower like lower resolution, but
right lower like lower resolution, but
they should be able to see.
they should be able to see.
Oh, for sure. Now they at least have
Oh, for sure. Now they at least have
an
an
idea of their universe.
Let's see if it's still like
Let's see if it's still like
um if it's still bad.
um if it's still bad.
If it's still
bad.
Doesn't seem any
better any recompiles and everything.
Kind of
surprising. Maybe it's a little more
surprising. Maybe it's a little more
stable. It's hard to say.
stable. It's hard to say.
I think it's probably pretty likely the
I think it's probably pretty likely the
um obs are no
good cuz now this should be able to do
good cuz now this should be able to do
things.
Um you want to humor me with a concept
Um you want to humor me with a concept
real quick? Mhm.
real quick? Mhm.
Instead of even having the whole end map
Instead of even having the whole end map
thing, just set it to one.
What?
What?
Set the OBS.
Set the OBS.
Oh, the value if it like one if the map
Oh, the value if it like one if the map
is not zero or what? Yeah. One if the
is not zero or what? Yeah. One if the
map is not zero. Yeah.
We could do
that. And then we'll have to edit
that. And then we'll have to edit
the the torch model, right?
the the torch model, right?
Yeah. To not like uber normalize it or
Yeah. To not like uber normalize it or
whatever.
Not doing any better than
15. That is suspicious. Mhm. I mean, it
15. That is suspicious. Mhm. I mean, it
can also be hypers and stuff as well,
can also be hypers and stuff as well,
right?
I guess so. Yeah. I mean, I would argue
I guess so. Yeah. I mean, I would argue
maybe this problem maybe need more
maybe this problem maybe need more
entropy or something.
entropy or something.
I don't know if you can know just from
I don't know if you can know just from
like
guessing. It crashes all the way down.
Totally Perf crashed. See
Totally Perf crashed. See
Mhm.
Mhm.
And then that's numerical bug.
just make sure if we train with full

No.
It is interesting that they're all going
It is interesting that they're all going
forward, isn't
it? Like they're not jittering around
it? Like they're not jittering around
and doing stuff.
and doing stuff.
So they've ignored
So they've ignored
turning. Well, they're turning, but
turning. Well, they're turning, but
they're like they're not

don't.
Did you eval it off stream? I didn't see
Did you eval it off stream? I didn't see
anything.
anything.
No, it's just from like what they were
No, it's just from like what they were
doing before.
Are we forgetting something in reset?
Are we forgetting something in reset?
Could be.
So all I do in reset is I randomize the
So all I do in reset is I randomize the
dozer positions. I zero out the dozer. I
dozer positions. I zero out the dozer. I
randomize the
randomize the
position. I reset the
tick. OBS returns. And then we copy the
tick. OBS returns. And then we copy the
original map.
Okay. Doesn't feel like there's anything
Okay. Doesn't feel like there's anything
missing from that. No.
missing from that. No.
And the score is like slightly higher
And the score is like slightly higher
than before, maybe. So maybe we need to
than before, maybe. So maybe we need to
just sweep stuff. I don't know.
Wait, wait, wait. I have I have an idea.
Wait, wait, wait. I have I have an idea.
I think that someone's agree with it.
I think that someone's agree with it.
Um, hold the phone. I see
Um, hold the phone. I see
something. I see
something. I see
something, but I want to verify it if
something, but I want to verify it if
I'm not being an idiot right now.
Okay, let's compare with other
environment. Oh yeah, your obs aren't
environment. Oh yeah, your obs aren't
going to each agent. You only have one
going to each agent. You only have one
ops for the entire thing that's shared.
What? How?
You're
You're
um you don't have agents times ops.
I have I
I have I

I'm surprised this doesn't break [ __ ]

but
Oh, I guess Okay, I guess you're right.
Oh, I guess Okay, I guess you're right.
That doesn't get used in the pipe. And
That doesn't get used in the pipe. And
also, it's this is huge. M size times M
also, it's this is huge. M size times M
size. It should be like times 121. So,
size. It should be like times 121. So,
that's like Yeah.
I guess it should be 121 times numbum
I guess it should be 121 times numbum
agents, right?
Yes. Until we change that.
And then
And then
secondarily to that concept in reset,
secondarily to that concept in reset,
you're not resetting each obs, you're
you're not resetting each obs, you're
just resetting one. Okay, let me check
just resetting one. Okay, let me check
that. Hang
that. Hang
on. Take a look at this policy first.
Boom. Like they drive around a bunch.
Boom. Like they drive around a bunch.
Well, I guess maybe it doesn't really

matter that much.
Are they actually doing it?
They might kind of be doing

I'm trying to see from when watching it
I'm trying to see from when watching it
if like the ones they seem like that
if like the ones they seem like that
like they're like hanging out in the
like they're like hanging out in the
region that has a bunch of
region that has a bunch of
dirt to move. But like if you look at
dirt to move. But like if you look at
there's like a couple of them that just
there's like a couple of them that just
sit in an area where there's nothing
where the top is a bunch of stuff right
where the top is a bunch of stuff right
now. Then that left they're like eating
now. Then that left they're like eating
that pillar. They leave now. They leave
that pillar. They leave now. They leave
cuz they ate all the dirt. Oh, those
cuz they ate all the dirt. Oh, those
guys
don't. It looks like they eat that one
don't. It looks like they eat that one
pillar and
pillar and
then one guy gives up and stays in the
then one guy gives up and stays in the
corner.
How cool is this going to
look? Okay, this starts to get slow
look? Okay, this starts to get slow
because the mesh unloading.
We definitely need to figure that out so
We definitely need to figure that out so
that we can
that we can
like do a giant Mars
map.
Okay. Is it being reasonable or is it
Okay. Is it being reasonable or is it
not being reasonable? I don't know.
Nice to hear you're both articulating
Nice to hear you're both articulating
your thoughts. Now we can learn more.
your thoughts. Now we can learn more.
Yeah, sometimes when I'm doing fiddly
Yeah, sometimes when I'm doing fiddly
bits of dev, it's tough to like go
bits of dev, it's tough to like go
through everything. You can always ask
through everything. You can always ask
stuff though.
I want to just like set up a little
I want to just like set up a little
basic sweep while we're uh looking at
basic sweep while we're uh looking at
things just in case it finds something.
things just in case it finds something.
Yeah, that seems fair.
Oh yeah.
Also, we'll see if this does anything
Also, we'll see if this does anything
good.
Okay.
Okay.
But I think we should assume it
won't this up over
here. I mean, usual suspects, right, are
um observations, rewards, resets.
um observations, rewards, resets.
We took care of OBS. OBS is now like
We took care of OBS. OBS is now like
as stupid simple as possible.
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. There's a big
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. There's a big
difference between um this thing's
difference between um this thing's
training at 1.5
training at 1.5
mil the first sweep
run that I don't know.
Weird.
Do you think the fact that it has an
Do you think the fact that it has an
action that does nothing affects it
action that does nothing affects it
learning or would it just learn to not
learning or would it just learn to not
use that action? Well, when I'm evaling
use that action? Well, when I'm evaling
it, I'm seeing it doing stuff.
Well, I know like you're seeing it do
Well, I know like you're seeing it do
stuff, but do you think that affects the
stuff, but do you think that affects the
process of learning or is it just like
process of learning or is it just like
it'll just learn to only send out the
it'll just learn to only send out the
other the correct versions for the
other the correct versions for the
other? I don't know. I mean, it needs
other? I don't know. I mean, it needs
kind of needs one because it's supposed
kind of needs one because it's supposed
to be able to pause in place and lower
to be able to pause in place and lower
the bucket and stuff.
Okay. Seems the reason
Okay, first experiment.
It definitely should be able to solve it
It definitely should be able to solve it
because ourware had a vision of its had
because ourware had a vision of its had
like nothing and it could still solve.
Observations are messed up somehow,

Mhm. And it's an easy solve,
Mhm. And it's an easy solve,
too. Like pretty immediate. It was Yeah,
too. Like pretty immediate. It was Yeah,
it was pretty immediate. It didn't even
it was pretty immediate. It didn't even
require like really much tuning at all.
require like really much tuning at all.
Yep.
So, what do we think here?
So, what do we think here?
There's possibly a question mark
on
on
maybe is the indexing wrong? I feel like
maybe is the indexing wrong? I feel like
it isn't.
it isn't.
Maybe doesn't seem like it would
be. Okay, you loop through all the
be. Okay, you loop through all the
agents at
agents at
each or each agent you're multiplying
each or each agent you're multiplying
by.
Wait, you're what the hell? Observation
Wait, you're what the hell? Observation
size two
times
times
11. Okay, so that's 121. Okay, so that
11. Okay, so that's 121. Okay, so that
should be
fine. Wait, where'd it go?
said you're going through agents. So
said you're going through agents. So
like that's going to make sure you get
like that's going to make sure you get
the right slice to the right guy.
You're multiplying X times observation
You're multiplying X times observation
size
size
because Y because that's getting the
because Y because that's getting the
right
index because two times vision plus one

is observation
is observation

is. We reconfirm the XY thing.
And we haven't gotten any good results
And we haven't gotten any good results
yet, I don't think, from the sweep
yet, I don't think, from the sweep

either.
Plus, so that should be able to get
it. So that'll be your

syntax here.
learn. Trying to think what else it
learn. Trying to think what else it
could be.
I'm
agents. Yeah, this is correct.
For a second, I was thinking maybe like
For a second, I was thinking maybe like
the bucket location was wrong, but I
the bucket location was wrong, but I
think that's okay. We're seeing it
think that's okay. We're seeing it
harvest harvest stuff, right?
Could it be getting actions wrong
Could it be getting actions wrong
somehow?
somehow?
possible be receiving the actions wrong.
possible be receiving the actions wrong.
I we see it like doing reasonable stuff
I we see it like doing reasonable stuff
is the thing. It's a little sus that
is the thing. It's a little sus that
we've not seen it like reverse at all.
And you're confident reversing is
And you're confident reversing is
possible?
possible?
It should
It should

correct. [ __ ]
Aha. You bastard.
I thought that there was a check to pass
I thought that there was a check to pass
that there was. I don't know
what
Always your data either it's going into
Always your data either it's going into
the endg or it's coming out of the end

frog every freaking time.
coming at a torch
most interesting.
That felt like that like changed
That felt like that like changed
recently or
something. Or maybe we just never see it
something. Or maybe we just never see it
because h some screwy there for
sure.
Would that cause an issue here? Think
Would that cause an issue here? Think
maybe. Would think so.
maybe. Would think so.
Good. I don't know what else it would
Good. I don't know what else it would
be.
Well, now seg faults, which is real
cool. Instantly
fixed. Let's go to run.
I mean, it would have to be screwed up
I mean, it would have to be screwed up
because
like I guess it actually depends on the
like I guess it actually depends on the
initial action buffer DT type, not the
initial action buffer DT type, not the
final one.
Let's run a little bit.
I know. It's not
I know. It's not
like we're not seeing anything like
like we're not seeing anything like
major

The fact this segment is a sketch.
Yeah, self actions is the correct D
Yeah, self actions is the correct D
type.
D type that error gets thrown. Yeah. So
D type that error gets thrown. Yeah. So
it was cast incorrectly basically. So,
it was cast incorrectly basically. So,
it was coming in from torch float 64,
it was coming in from torch float 64,
but then we were it was getting cast
but then we were it was getting cast
anyways.
But seemingly that hasn't changed
But seemingly that hasn't changed
anything.
anything.
Yeah. No, no, no. Like it was fine to
Yeah. No, no, no. Like it was fine to
begin with. It's like there was an
begin with. It's like there was an
error, but like it got cancelceled out.
Okay, so it's running around.
Okay, so it's running around.
It's ideally it sees something that's
It's ideally it sees something that's
pretty much a one. It should run towards
pretty much a one. It should run towards
the one.
Yeah. So literally all this does it sets
Yeah. So literally all this does it sets
the pointer to the action pointer as
the pointer to the action pointer as
well.
Well, there are params that do way
Well, there are params that do way
worse, but I don't think that this means
worse, but I don't think that this means
it's good.
Um, well, one thing that I did in
Um, well, one thing that I did in
Rareware that we haven't done here is I
Rareware that we haven't done here is I
still give it the location
still give it the location
of the car or the
of the car or the
robot in the ops before the vision as
robot in the ops before the vision as
just like another part, just another
just like another part, just another
thing to add to
ops. I give it I give it its
ops. I give it I give it its
um its location and the direction it's
um its location and the direction it's
facing. Yeah, you could give it its
facing. Yeah, you could give it its
heading and stuff. That would
heading and stuff. That would
probably be useful though. I mean, it
probably be useful though. I mean, it
does. It has an LSTM,
right? Should be able to learn to store
right? Should be able to learn to store
that.
Maybe it can't
Maybe it can't
tell. It probably can't tell. You're
right. Let's give it the additional uh
right. Let's give it the additional uh
the additional obs.
Yeah, it's just it's just plus one. And
Yeah, it's just it's just plus one. And
then we you're going to have to change
then we you're going to have to change
we'll have to change the torch. Wait, we
we'll have to change the torch. Wait, we
give it
give it
heading velocity. give it a heading and
heading velocity. give it a heading and
it's the cell that it's in in the
it's the cell that it's in in the
velocity.
Then we can add a flat layer that
Then we can add a flat layer that
connects the vision to this. Well, you
connects the vision to this. Well, you
want to give it like XY velocity
want to give it like XY velocity
heading.
Uh I don't even think you have to give
Uh I don't even think you have to give
it XY really, but I
it XY really, but I
mean actually no, I think you do for
mean actually no, I think you do for
Uh what did I what did I get for GPU
Uh what did I what did I get for GPU
drive in RWware? All I gave it was the
drive in RWware? All I gave it was the

then the the um this is continuous like
then the the um this is continuous like
there's sketchy things that go on.
there's sketchy things that go on.
Well, not really.
Well, not really.
I'm mostly concerned that you can't
I'm mostly concerned that you can't
actually see very well like immediately
actually see very well like immediately
around you.
Yeah, you can just add the thing to the
Yeah, you can just add the thing to the
back of it. It'll probably be the
back of it. It'll probably be the
simplest
way. This
thing All
right. Well, let's see if that makes a
right. Well, let's see if that makes a
difference. I have to still edit the
difference. I have to still edit the

Oh. Uh, it's a char. So, we have to do a
Oh. Uh, it's a char. So, we have to do a

weird here.
which max V is like Five.
And this is like pi
And this is like pi
50. Okay. So, we'll see if this does

What's the point of that? Well, it goes
What's the point of that? Well, it goes
into a uh un 8 range, right? And then
into a uh un 8 range, right? And then
has to get reormalized.
M dozers. Oh, M do M dozer's eye.
M dozers. Oh, M do M dozer's eye.
Uh hang on.
Unsigned. What' I
Unsigned. What' I
do? Unsigned car and apply as float.
Oh,
this we didn't update the network at

That not be multiplied.
Let's run it with proper size and see if
Let's run it with proper size and see if
this does anything. So far from
sweeps, yeah, it's pretty insistent that
sweeps, yeah, it's pretty insistent that
uh there's not much
What other things can we
back. Is it training worse
now? Looks like it's training worse.
Where' Spencer
Okay, so this does like noticeably
Okay, so this does like noticeably
worse than
worse than
before, but maybe there was some
before, but maybe there was some
learning signal in it previously.
All right, I'm back. I was on a call.
All right, I'm back. I was on a call.
Mhm.

Uh, yeah. I had to go talk with Elon
Uh, yeah. I had to go talk with Elon
real quick. Yeah. Yeah.
He said he'll fund the venture. Oh,
He said he'll fund the venture. Oh,
awesome.
Did you agree to the uh puffer fish
Did you agree to the uh puffer fish
habitat extension?
habitat extension?
Yeah, but only is that if we solved the
Yeah, but only is that if we solved the
bug we're currently working on. Ah,
bug we're currently working on. Ah,
[ __ ] Okay, we got to do that then.
And that's tough. Good bargain. All
And that's tough. Good bargain. All
right, that's a hard bargain. I'm a good
right, that's a hard bargain. I'm a good
negotiator.
So, was giving it vision to nothing? Uh,
So, was giving it vision to nothing? Uh,
it's doing worse now. Really? Yeah. So,
it's doing worse now. Really? Yeah. So,
I think something is screw with the odds
I think something is screw with the odds
if it's doing worse, right? So, it
if it's doing worse, right? So, it
shouldn't be doing worse from that.
Like,
Like,
yeah, that seems
weird. Wait, what?
weird. Wait, what?
Yeah, it doesn't seem right.
Yeah, it doesn't seem right.
This would mean that they all have x of

So
it's 512. So
it's 512. So
255 by 5. It should be the dozer X like
255 by 5. It should be the dozer X like
divide by
divide by
two. Oh, it is. It's
220.
Okay. Then this 114 which should be over
Okay. Then this 114 which should be over
two. Yep.
I'm like
confused. Oh, hang on. Wait. Isn't this
confused. Oh, hang on. Wait. Isn't this
this one's wrong? Right. This is I times
this one's wrong? Right. This is I times
total
observation
observation
size. Oh, this is
fine. Oh, wait. So, it's
one, not 125.
I think I'm doing this wrong somehow.
I think I'm doing this wrong somehow.
Total OBS should be 125 for sure, right?
Total OBS should be 125 for sure, right?
Mhm. So then it's I times. So I is
Mhm. So then it's I times. So I is
zero should be
121. Oh yeah. 121. There should be at a
121. Oh yeah. 121. There should be at a
um the X
value
zero which it should be at
zero which it should be at
121. Observation size times observation
121. Observation size times observation
size
121. Why is
Yeah. So, it's writing to um the wrong
Yeah. So, it's writing to um the wrong
spot here, and I'm trying to figure out
spot here, and I'm trying to figure out
why.
This thing is building
correctly. All
right. So, we break on
idx is 125.
Huh? Oh, I must have done something like
Huh? Oh, I must have done something like
stupid here, right? No, I didn't.
stupid here, right? No, I didn't.
What? Yeah, it's somehow it's wrong and
What? Yeah, it's somehow it's wrong and
I don't understand.
Uh, what is Okay. What's total ops?
I have a potential idea. Yeah, going
I have a potential idea. Yeah, going
crazy.
crazy.
Okay. What if total
Okay. What if total
obs and the way that it's being set up
obs and the way that it's being set up
as its uh like weird constant thing is
as its uh like weird constant thing is
doing a order of operations thing where
doing a order of operations thing where
it's multiplying 0 times the first thing
it's multiplying 0 times the first thing
and then adding four at the end.
Um
Um
and so it's not doing like I times zero.
and so it's not doing like I times zero.
It's doing like or it's not doing zero
It's doing like or it's not doing zero
times the value the whole value group
times the value the whole value group
together. It's just doing zero times the
together. It's just doing zero times the
observation size and then leaving the
observation size and then leaving the
plus4 afterwards.
plus4 afterwards.
Where is even where is the plus4 even
Where is even where is the plus4 even
and total obs?
Oh god. Damn it.
Oh god. Damn it.
But that shouldn't still that's to even
But that shouldn't still that's to even
do it.
do it.
It's the only thing I could think of
It's the only thing I could think of
having a a bonus four
having a a bonus four
somewhere like put a parenthesy around
somewhere like put a parenthesy around
total observation size and the whole
total observation size and the whole
thing. No, no, no. Around the plus four
thing. No, no, no. Around the plus four
as well.
Oh yeah, it must be doing that. You're
Oh yeah, it must be doing that. You're
right. You're totally right. It must be
right. You're totally right. It must be
doing the
doing the
Okay, we'll just We'll double check. Let
Okay, we'll just We'll double check. Let
me
me
recompile. Yeah, I This is why we
recompile. Yeah, I This is why we
shouldn't be using macros. Like, it's
shouldn't be using macros. Like, it's
just dumb,
just dumb,
right? This wouldn't have happened if we
right? This wouldn't have happened if we
actually computed the damn value of a
actually computed the damn value of a
constant.
That's a spicy bug right
there. I've been meaning to use um con I
there. I've been meaning to use um con I
don't know why the hell I didn't do
don't know why the hell I didn't do
that.
that.
Good old PM doss never
fails. I hope this is it. That's the
fails. I hope this is it. That's the
only thing I can think of.
Isn't it? I don't know.
Yeah, there we go.
Let's see if this at least gets us back
Let's see if this at least gets us back
to the original 16. Yeah, cuz I think
to the original 16. Yeah, cuz I think
there was a difference. Like when we put
there was a difference. Like when we put
screwy data in, it got to only 14.
It's weird that they have like they
It's weird that they have like they
can't stop as well. Like they're just
can't stop as well. Like they're just
going.
Um
it's probably just cuz like the it's
it's probably just cuz like the it's
like they
like they
excel. Yeah, we probably just need to
excel. Yeah, we probably just need to
screw with some dynamics as well.
Like the movement's probably pretty
Like the movement's probably pretty
weird. Let's at least see if this does
weird. Let's at least see if this does
anything
first. So, four
first. So, four
runs.
runs.
Confirming that we are not doing any
Confirming that we are not doing any
better than
17ish. Oh, and I messed this up. But at
17ish. Oh, and I messed this up. But at
least we can see.
Yeah, those are reasonable OBS 1D
Yeah, those are reasonable OBS 1D
params. That's
correct. Uh, let's just do this.
The last two are zero because they're
The last two are zero because they're
not used at all or
not used at all or
uh it's first step that doesn't have any
uh it's first step that doesn't have any
velocity and initial heading of zero.
velocity and initial heading of zero.
Got it.
So, it doesn't have any ability to like
So, it doesn't have any ability to like
turn or do anything like it doesn't have
turn or do anything like it doesn't have
any ability to like slow
We'll see what this does
We'll see what this does
first. But if this does like 17 or
whatever. Okay.
Oh, 18. Oh, hang on. Look at that.
Oh, 18. Oh, hang on. Look at that.
That's We've never seen a 20.
Huh. So, yep. It just couldn't tell
Huh. So, yep. It just couldn't tell
where it was. Good
call. for honor and glory.
Oh, it's pumping. It's pumping.
I have some more ideas. It weirdly
I have some more ideas. It weirdly
collapses like from like 23 to 20. And
collapses like from like 23 to 20. And
then
it's doing things though.
it's doing things though.
It looks like it's at least improving.
Well, I don't know. It dropped to 19
Well, I don't know. It dropped to 19
now. Now I'm scared.
It will be
It will be
decimation of much
decimation of much
terrain. Fine tune this a bit. See if we
terrain. Fine tune this a bit. See if we
get something cool out of it. And then
get something cool out of it. And then
we can uh maybe this is dozen.
Maybe dozer time.
So, can you explain the whole like char
So, can you explain the whole like char
to float thing that you're doing with
to float thing that you're doing with
the times 40 and times 50? How do you
the times 40 and times 50? How do you
know that that's like give it a
know that that's like give it a
reasonable correct number? You only have
reasonable correct number? You only have
255 values to store stuff in a char.
255 values to store stuff in a char.
Yes. So, you should probably try to put
Yes. So, you should probably try to put
your data into a 0 to 255 so that when
your data into a 0 to 255 so that when
you normal like squash it back down like
you normal like squash it back down like
you at least get some reasonable
you at least get some reasonable
resolution.
So, like if I go if I go try to put the
So, like if I go if I go try to put the
value like five, uh, if I go try to put
value like five, uh, if I go try to put
like the value like 5.5 into a char,
like the value like 5.5 into a char,
right? Mhm. I'm only going to get five.
right? Mhm. I'm only going to get five.
Okay. Okay. Now, if I multiply it by 40
Okay. Okay. Now, if I multiply it by 40
and then I divide by 40 on the other
and then I divide by 40 on the other
side, I'm actually going to get
side, I'm actually going to get
something a lot closer.
to like what the the original value
to like what the the original value
should be like. Yes.
And are you dividing by 40 in the
And are you dividing by 40 in the
torch.py right now? I'm dividing by 255.
torch.py right now? I'm dividing by 255.
So I'm like trying to get them roughly
So I'm like trying to get them roughly
to the range of zero of to like 0 to
to the range of zero of to like 0 to
255.
Okay. Yeah. So, that's a nice trick to
Okay. Yeah. So, that's a nice trick to
know.
All right. So, here are terraforming
agents. These are apparently
agents. These are apparently
terraforming a bit better than
before. They are kind of fun to watch.
before. They are kind of fun to watch.
We should definitely get the uh the map
We should definitely get the uh the map
like render working nicer. Um but let's
like render working nicer. Um but let's
get there's one more experiment I want
get there's one more experiment I want
to try
first. So I just want to give them the
first. So I just want to give them the
like I want to up their acceleration
like I want to up their acceleration
speed.
Do you think if
Do you think if
um due to the dilation if it's like
um due to the dilation if it's like
right in front of
right in front of
you, there's a chance you won't see it
you, there's a chance you won't see it
anymore?
Yes.
Absolutely. I want to see if this
Absolutely. I want to see if this
actually helps him out at all.
Now they should actually be able to like
Now they should actually be able to like
stop like do
things and then if this works then what
things and then if this works then what
we'll do is we'll run the sweep on this
we'll do is we'll run the sweep on this
and then we will uh do some work on E
N.
N.
Yes, it's 5:31. I have dinner at 6.
Yes, it's 5:31. I have dinner at 6.
Okay, that timing works cuz I got to
Okay, that timing works cuz I got to
head out relatively soon as well.
Okay, but we will have the initial
Okay, but we will have the initial
version of this
version of this
end. a very simple initial prototype
end. a very simple initial prototype
uh
training and then I mean honestly the
training and then I mean honestly the
more the more important thing I think is
more the more important thing I think is
going to be like the you we can do like
going to be like the you we can do like
the initial digging capacity stuff
the initial digging capacity stuff
really easily before we have to do the
really easily before we have to do the
geometry for like axis aligned or
geometry for like axis aligned or
whatever this or
whatever this or
that but like we got to get like the
that but like we got to get like the
scale of it right and all
that I also would like to get the
that I also would like to get the
rendering to actually look like
rendering to actually look like
reasonable cuz I kind of just threw a
reasonable cuz I kind of just threw a
random pearl noise map at it. It like we
random pearl noise map at it. It like we
actually have to render based on height
actually have to render based on height
and such.
It is based on height. What are you What
It is based on height. What are you What
are you talking about?
are you talking about?
Uh the coloration is not based on
Uh the coloration is not based on
height.
height.
Oh,
Oh,
it's just a random pearl in map.
it's just a random pearl in map.
So like the texture when you're applying
So like the texture when you're applying
the
texture, this suddenly does way
texture, this suddenly does way
worse with more speed, more ability to
worse with more speed, more ability to
accelerate.
Yeah. Unless maybe it just takes longer
Yeah. Unless maybe it just takes longer
to learn something.
I think being able to like stop and
I think being able to like stop and
collect all the resources in an area
collect all the resources in an area
would be useful. No,
I don't see from your change how that
I don't see from your change how that
would have
would have
actually your goal. Well, if it's if it
actually your goal. Well, if it's if it
takes like 10 steps to accelerate, like
takes like 10 steps to accelerate, like
to decelerate, it might just not bother.
We could also make the thing just not be
We could also make the thing just not be
able to drive through um piles of stuff,
able to drive through um piles of stuff,
right? Pretty darn easily.
What? Like if you check two behind? No.
What? Like if you check two behind? No.
If you just like if you're if you're
If you just like if you're if you're
trying to move into dirt and your bucket
trying to move into dirt and your bucket
is full, you
can't. There are a lot of things we can
can't. There are a lot of things we can
do to like make this just a bit better.
do to like make this just a bit better.
Okay, let me fix Let me revert um the
Okay, let me fix Let me revert um the
thing that I did because I that doesn't
thing that I did because I that doesn't
seem to have helped. like heard it quite
seem to have helped. like heard it quite
a bit
actually.
Oops. So this is our most recent
run and this will be sweepable.
All
All
right. Solid.
Does it want to sweep right now or are
Does it want to sweep right now or are
you just rerunning the same pram to make
you just rerunning the same pram to make
sure it works?
The one on the left is just uh checking.
Is it done? Uh, we have something that's
Is it done? Uh, we have something that's
doing us like it is training. Yeah. Perf
doing us like it is training. Yeah. Perf
20. That's impressive.
20. That's impressive.
You have no idea of the scale.
from zero to one, isn't it? No, not in
from zero to one, isn't it? No, not in
this one. Oh, okay. How can we compare
this one. Oh, okay. How can we compare
them then? Oh, whatever.
them then? Oh, whatever.
We've been working on this a day. Yeah.
We've been working on this a day. Yeah.
Give it a second. I'm just giving you
Give it a second. I'm just giving you
crap.
All right. So, this is now
All right. So, this is now
Neptune
Terraform. Boom.
Terraform. Boom.
So, this will run a sweep
hopefully. And I think we can start with
hopefully. And I think we can start with
that. Um, you know,
that. Um, you know,
potentially working on the full
potentially working on the full
smoothing end, right? Like the full like
smoothing end, right? Like the full like
the full terraform end like um having it
the full terraform end like um having it
like pick up the dirt and then put it
like pick up the dirt and then put it
down instead of just deleting dirt. It
down instead of just deleting dirt. It
runs over.
Oh, you mean to like actually start like
Oh, you mean to like actually start like
having a target map? Mhm.
having a target map? Mhm.
Well, not just having a target map,
Well, not just having a target map,
right? Like it should be able to
right? Like it should be able to
actually Right now it's just driving
actually Right now it's just driving
over stuff and deleting it like load the
over stuff and deleting it like load the
bucket, drop dirt, like all that
bucket, drop dirt, like all that
proper terraform amp.
Does it eval? If we're doing proper
Does it eval? If we're doing proper
terraform, arguably, shouldn't we never
terraform, arguably, shouldn't we never
reset?
reset?
No, you can reset arbitrarily. Yeah, I I
No, you can reset arbitrarily. Yeah, I I
think you can reset arbitrarily because
think you can reset arbitrarily because
you can gen different maps,
but yeah, you could do it as just
but yeah, you could do it as just
continuous as well.
Okay. So, this will just this will
Okay. So, this will just this will
train. Hopefully, we're good on
this. Is the code pushed? Can I Can I
this. Is the code pushed? Can I Can I
try it or when you want to want to demo
try it or when you want to want to demo
it for
me? Oh, I want to I want to see it.
Oh, it's on dev. Um, bet we should also
Oh, it's on dev. Um, bet we should also
like we should fix the uh the damn
like we should fix the uh the damn
camera on this thing.
Okay.
Okay.
So, get me to fix the
camera. But these guys will run around
camera. But these guys will run around
and attempt to flatten
everything. It's like pretty darn smooth
everything. It's like pretty darn smooth
the movement, huh?
Yeah, the dynamics are pretty chill.
Uh, is this is this trained or is this
Uh, is this is this trained or is this
just Yeah, that's trained.
just Yeah, that's trained.
I can't see them flattening stuff. Uh,
I can't see them flattening stuff. Uh,
camera's shitty.
camera's shitty.
Oh, like are the little hills getting
Oh, like are the little hills getting
smaller?
smaller?
Yeah. So,
I still feel like as like just how it is
I still feel like as like just how it is
currently which is like kind of like a
currently which is like kind of like a
fine resource
fine resource
problem. It should be still doing better
problem. It should be still doing better
though. Yeah. Yeah, it should be. But we
though. Yeah. Yeah, it should be. But we
will uh we'll see from sweep and then we
will uh we'll see from sweep and then we
also have stuff to fiddle with.
also have stuff to fiddle with.
It is training.
It is training.
I mean, one parameter change on gamma on
I mean, one parameter change on gamma on
GPU drive makes it like learn nothing
GPU drive makes it like learn nothing
versus learn something pretty much.
versus learn something pretty much.
Yeah, it's gamma for
you. Is this camera like not what I
you. Is this camera like not what I
think it
think it
is? I like I don't understand how the
is? I like I don't understand how the
hell this camera works.
hell this camera works.
Yeah, cuz like we want to be
Yeah, cuz like we want to be
Well, you want to be above, right?
Well, you want to be above, right?
Yeah. Or like
But when I enter these params in, it
But when I enter these params in, it
doesn't freaking work. Like, I don't get
doesn't freaking work. Like, I don't get
this view when I enter these params.
Yeah. So, it's probably not what it
Yeah. So, it's probably not what it
looks like.
Joseph, I wonder if you
um turn off dilation, it'll if that will
um turn off dilation, it'll if that will
actually change anything because now
actually change anything because now
that it knows like where it is.
that it knows like where it is.
We can definitely try that
We can definitely try that
now. Zip
This is freaking camera.
So these are hardcoded I think.
compile time only. Okay. So, we have to
compile time only. Okay. So, we have to
scale some things, I
scale some things, I
think, to get the uh the camera to work
think, to get the uh the camera to work
the way we want. I can just get
the way we want. I can just get
something that's like decent for now.
something that's like decent for now.
How do you want it to work? You want it
How do you want it to work? You want it
to work like Photoshop where you kind of
to work like Photoshop where you kind of
can like zoom in, drag around, rotate,
can like zoom in, drag around, rotate,
perspective. Well, it's just the
perspective. Well, it's just the
camera's clipping.
camera's clipping.
I don't know what you mean by clipping
I don't know what you mean by clipping
in this case. Okay, look. You see this?
in this case. Okay, look. You see this?
Oh, on the out. Okay. When you're Is it
Oh, on the out. Okay. When you're Is it
when you're too far away? Yeah.
This is fine, though. I'll do this for
This is fine, though. I'll do this for
now.
do this
cube. All right. Now, do you want to try
cube. All right. Now, do you want to try
dilation?
dilation?
I can do
that. Uh what would we say? Dilation.
that. Uh what would we say? Dilation.
Yeah. Yeah. To make it okay.
Yeah. Yeah. To make it okay.
Just not have it. Yeah.
What's your mini game represent? It is
What's your mini game represent? It is
uh we're working on an excavation
uh we're working on an excavation
sim. So, the goal is going to be that
sim. So, the goal is going to be that
you have uh a initial landscape and then
you have uh a initial landscape and then
you have a target landscape and you move
you have a target landscape and you move
all the dirt
all the dirt
around to terraform, I don't know,
around to terraform, I don't know,
terraform Mars or whatever.
terraform Mars or whatever.
It'll be
fun. Care for Mars.
I too love pressing the up arrow until I
I too love pressing the up arrow until I
can find the
command. What's going on
command. What's going on
here? Terraforming
here? Terraforming
Mars. We'll see if this works in the
meantime. All right, so we've got this
meantime. All right, so we've got this
N. Oops. We've got this N
here. And uh these are just random cars
here. And uh these are just random cars
at the
at the
moment. But yeah, the landscape here,
moment. But yeah, the landscape here,
you can see it's not rendered amazingly
you can see it's not rendered amazingly
well yet, but um here, let's see if you
well yet, but um here, let's see if you
can see like them cutting through some
can see like them cutting through some
of it. Yeah, so they just cut a pathway
of it. Yeah, so they just cut a pathway
right through there. See this
right through there. See this
pathway also. Yes, do start the repo.
pathway also. Yes, do start the repo.
That helps us out a lot. It's all open
That helps us out a lot. It's all open

It's weird that some of them like just
It's weird that some of them like just
sitting in the corner. This one is uh
sitting in the corner. This one is uh
No, this is random.
No, this is random.
This one is random. Oh, this one's
This one is random. Oh, this one's
random. Uh, yeah. I I set it on this
random. Uh, yeah. I I set it on this
because I can't scroll the camera around
because I can't scroll the camera around
on the other one. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
on the other one. Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I got you. So, they're always set
Yeah. I got you. So, they're always set
to digging, right? They're always
to digging, right? They're always
digging.
digging.
Yeah, they're not they're not uh it's
Yeah, they're not they're not uh it's
just at the moment it's just bulldozing
just at the moment it's just bulldozing
over everything.
over everything.
There's no noop.
There's no noop.
I think technically there is a noop
I think technically there is a noop
where you can just drive and not dig.
Oh, no, no, no. It's digging is always
Oh, no, no, no. It's digging is always
on. Digging because it may it may be
on. Digging because it may it may be
more efficient to drive and not dig
more efficient to drive and not dig
sometimes.
So far, it seems like it's done better
So far, it seems like it's done better
with the
with the
dilation. But it's actually learning
dilation. But it's actually learning
stuff either way. Now, let's see the uh
stuff either way. Now, let's see the uh
let's see the
let's see the
Neptune. Okay, so yeah, but the graph
Neptune. Okay, so yeah, but the graph
looks a little smoother on this one.
looks a little smoother on this one.
I think
I think
it's still climbing. I mean, it's at
it's still climbing. I mean, it's at
like 19 now.
like 19 now.
Okay. So, here are here's the new sweep.
Okay. So, do they have to be moving to
Okay. So, do they have to be moving to
bulldo or so far? Yes. because we were
bulldo or so far? Yes. because we were
debugging stuff.
debugging stuff.
Cuz if they get bull in place, they
Cuz if they get bull in place, they
might just stay on the ground and No,
might just stay on the ground and No,
cuz it just deletes all the dirt and
cuz it just deletes all the dirt and
they don't get any more
they don't get any more
reward. I mean, it's not done obviously,
reward. I mean, it's not done obviously,
right? Like it needs to be so that they
right? Like it needs to be so that they
move dirt around, not just like eat
move dirt around, not just like eat
dirt.
dirt.
Well, the dirt's just going away right
Well, the dirt's just going away right
now. Yeah, it's like Pac-Man. We're just
now. Yeah, it's like Pac-Man. We're just
trying to get it to see if we can like,
trying to get it to see if we can like,
you know, train like have some basic
you know, train like have some basic
thing training before we make the sim
thing training before we make the sim
super complicated. That would that would
super complicated. That would that would
make that would make sense. Um, yeah,
make that would make sense. Um, yeah,
just saying performance is looking
just saying performance is looking
pretty comparable.
pretty comparable.
Yeah. I mean, we can try either way.
Yeah. I mean, we can try either way.
We'll probably just stick it into a
We'll probably just stick it into a
sweep, right?
Yeah. All right. Maybe it's not as
Yeah. All right. Maybe it's not as
comparable.
Sweep has not discovered anything too
Sweep has not discovered anything too
amazing just yet.
amazing just yet.
How long are you running experiments
How long are you running experiments
for? 100 mil.
Okay. Oh, okay. Maybe dilation does help
Okay. Oh, okay. Maybe dilation does help
because this thing looks like it just
because this thing looks like it just
entirely collapsed. I think it's
entirely collapsed. I think it's
probably just like poorly tuned other
probably just like poorly tuned other
params, right?
The dilation should help
though. It's a good trick.
All right, let's go add the dilation
All right, let's go add the dilation
back in because
back in because
Yeah. What did I say? Was it four? Yeah,
Yeah. What did I say? Was it four? Yeah,
it was four. Yes. Yes, it was four.
I know you don't want obs to be big, but
I know you don't want obs to be big, but
what if you did like a super wide
what if you did like a super wide
dilation and then a really small for
dilation and then a really small for
like fine grade around
like fine grade around
you at some point?
you at some point?
I mean, yeah, we could just come up with
I mean, yeah, we could just come up with
a formula that does that.
So, what does dilation do?
So, what does dilation do?
Uh, it's Let me show
you. See these white dots?
No, there are white dots around the
No, there are white dots around the
agents. He's waiting for the stream to
agents. He's waiting for the stream to
catch up. Yeah. So, it can see
catch up. Yeah. So, it can see
everywhere there's a white dot.
everywhere there's a white dot.
So, it's an 11 by 11 grid, but it's not
So, it's an 11 by 11 grid, but it's not
dense. It's sparse.
dense. It's sparse.
Yeah. It doesn't need to see every
Yeah. It doesn't need to see every
point, though. All it needs to see is a
point, though. All it needs to see is a
point that's higher than the other
point that's higher than the other
points dirt wise. Yeah. So, it should be
points dirt wise. Yeah. So, it should be
able to do that from this grid.
able to do that from this grid.
Dilation is just spreading them out
Dilation is just spreading them out
then. Or Mhm. pretty much. Yeah. Why
then. Or Mhm. pretty much. Yeah. Why
don't Why don't you have just like
don't Why don't you have just like
really big sort of
really big sort of
sparse views?
sparse views?
This is what that is. I mean, I could
This is what that is. I mean, I could
make it bigger. How big how big how big
make it bigger. How big how big how big
is that like IRL since you're making
is that like IRL since you're making
this on like a actual measurement basis?
this on like a actual measurement basis?
No idea yet. We have to scale things
No idea yet. We have to scale things
correctly
correctly
cuz like I don't even think the dozers
cuz like I don't even think the dozers
are the right size at the moment. It's
are the right size at the moment. It's
just like it's whatever it is at the
just like it's whatever it is at the
moment. When I'm driving, you know, the
moment. When I'm driving, you know, the
the skid steer, I don't need to see six
the skid steer, I don't need to see six
centimeters, you know? I need to see
centimeters, you know? I need to see
like 10
feet. It might work. It might might work
feet. It might work. It might might work
better with it spread out. I mean this
better with it spread out. I mean this
is
is
like this is 40 some odd units wide I
like this is 40 some odd units wide I
think. So I whatever that is
think. So I whatever that is
I want to say I think I agree with what
I want to say I think I agree with what
it's Spencer correct
on
on
the Oh dude. Yeah.
the Oh dude. Yeah.
uh on the because like I get what Bet's
uh on the because like I get what Bet's
saying and like I need to see like 10
saying and like I need to see like 10
feet around me, but like as you get
feet around me, but like as you get
closer to things is when you pay more
closer to things is when you pay more
close attention to like your immediate
close attention to like your immediate
surroundings and as you get
surroundings and as you get
further then like less attention on the
further then like less attention on the
minute detail.
minute detail.
There you go. Let's add
attention. Joke, Joseph, I got a dip in
attention. Joke, Joseph, I got a dip in
like five. Yeah, so do I, man.
like five. Yeah, so do I, man.
All right. I mean, this is like decent
All right. I mean, this is like decent
progress. We will see. Uh we'll see if
progress. We will see. Uh we'll see if
anything comes out of the sweep. Uh
anything comes out of the sweep. Uh
there's still some fiddly bits with
there's still some fiddly bits with
sweeps at the moment, but we will see if
sweeps at the moment, but we will see if
anything comes out of sweeps. And then
anything comes out of sweeps. And then
yeah, we uh this is like a decent base
yeah, we uh this is like a decent base
for New Sim. Like I think we can
for New Sim. Like I think we can
probably get uh get it doing a bunch of
probably get uh get it doing a bunch of
things if we just make the well improve
things if we just make the well improve
the fidelity. Anyways, so uh is there um
the fidelity. Anyways, so uh is there um
I'll just do outro now.
I'll just do outro now.
you want me to kind of do as a next
you want me to kind of do as a next
steps if I just like find myself working
steps if I just like find myself working
on it at times? Yeah. So, the the
on it at times? Yeah. So, the the
commented block of logic where it's like
commented block of logic where it's like
fill up with dirt and then like you know
fill up with dirt and then like you know
drop dirt probably that. Okay.
And I would just make it so it can't
And I would just make it so it can't
keep it can't go forward if uh the
keep it can't go forward if uh the
bucket's full and it's pushing up
bucket's full and it's pushing up
against dirt. So, if it's trying to pick
against dirt. So, if it's trying to pick
up more dirt and the bucket's full, it
up more dirt and the bucket's full, it
just gets stuck. that'll like you'll
just gets stuck. that'll like you'll
actually see it have to like reverse and
actually see it have to like reverse and
stuff
stuff
