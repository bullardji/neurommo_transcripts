I'll go over the details of that as we

now, hey, that guy, how's it going? Uh,
now, hey, that guy, how's it going? Uh,
let me see can do.
let me see can do.
So,
So,
get a few things set up.
I want to do this locally or remote.
I want to do this locally or remote.
Probably locally maybe.
Yeah, probably we just do it locally,
Yeah, probably we just do it locally,
right? Maybe we don't have any issues
right? Maybe we don't have any issues
with SSH
with SSH
rendering.
Yes. Let's just get this set up.
All I need to do is I looked a little
All I need to do is I looked a little
bit about at this package ahead of time
bit about at this package ahead of time
just so that we wouldn't be completely
just so that we wouldn't be completely
from scratch.
So,
So,
lamps.
I believe we just clone this thing.
You want this from source.
And uh yeah, it's just a CMake.
And uh yeah, it's just a CMake.
I remember I kind of did a trial run of
I remember I kind of did a trial run of
this.
I didn't get as far as actually figuring
I didn't get as far as actually figuring
out how to use the CAPI, but I did make
out how to use the CAPI, but I did make
sure there is one. Got to get my daily
sure there is one. Got to get my daily
or else stood fix out here every day

making it happen. Hey, I've been gone
making it happen. Hey, I've been gone
this week because I've been doing work
this week because I've been doing work
in person. And I've been an SF.
Oh, wait. I'm dumb. Hang on. I didn't Am
Oh, wait. I'm dumb. Hang on. I didn't Am
I not in the container?
Um,
right. I forgot that it's the dumb

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Oh, right. Okay. I don't have the Yeah,

that's fine. Never mind. We're good
that's fine. Never mind. We're good

work
as is then.
What did I do? Did I actually just ran

Yeah, I don't actually have any material
Yeah, I don't actually have any material
science background reference.
I'm kind of just guessing that I'm going
I'm kind of just guessing that I'm going
to be able to figure it out.
I did discuss this uh in depth with a
I did discuss this uh in depth with a
material scientist though and we think

that the idea makes sense. I don't know
that the idea makes sense. I don't know
any of the details. Um I do know that I
any of the details. Um I do know that I
probably
probably
going to be in a better place to figure

out the engineering and especially
out the engineering and especially
hooking it up though than most would be.
Oh,
there
Okay, so this should
optional the executable into your system
API headers.

Okay.
Okay.
So, we can try this
and then we'll go to Puffer and we'll
and then we'll go to Puffer and we'll
try to like get some basic demo.

No one has tried. Oh, I didn't even

It's cool, but not my top thing.
Post this real quick.
Uh,
Uh,
I've got to get myself into the actual

meetings all week.
Was it May?
We have 2,000 in the Discord yet or not
We have 2,000 in the Discord yet or not
quite.
Why is this thing not show up?
The 2,000 in the Discord.

I'm just going to assume it is
now doing reward design. Oh, wait. Hang
now doing reward design. Oh, wait. Hang

3001. Thank you. Oh, welcome. Yeah, I
3001. Thank you. Oh, welcome. Yeah, I
replied to your DM, I believe. Come
replied to your DM, I believe. Come
build some stuff with us.
build some stuff with us.
Do you just not have a sensor? Cuz like
Do you just not have a sensor? Cuz like
obviously
obviously
if it can't see where the walls are,
if it can't see where the walls are,
right?
right?
You could do that even with just one

depth sensor though, right?
Well, something's not hooked up right.
Well, something's not hooked up right.
It should be it should be very easy to
It should be it should be very easy to
learn like to not crash into walls.
So, I would identify whether it's a

problem in the sim or it's a sim to real

or it's like
or it's like
yeah, something screw for sure.
Like I would understand if okay it's

harder to hover because there are

There we go. Back to real work.
There we go. Back to real work.
Lamps built.
Why is this stupid bar not way?
Okay.
So,
and this gives us probably headers on

global path
global path
maybe.
Okay. So, it's built.
Where's the API?
Where's the API?
The API. We want this, right?
They have a gooey as well.
course library.h.
So if I just do
here
for
Yes.
What am I doing? It should be.
They have sample programs anywhere.
Okay, they do have
Okay, they do have
I just run this
see if this actually runs
this. Can I?
This has got to be test.c See?
Uh,
Uh,
it's already on the path. I probably
it's already on the path. I probably
have to link, don't I?
have to link, don't I?
Oh, actually, this does show up.
Oh, actually, this does show up.
Oh, hang on. Why? That's being included
Oh, hang on. Why? That's being included
correctly. Then why
not working?
not working?
There like extra compile flags you need.
There like extra compile flags you need.
Oh, hey Ken Vert. And hey, uh, welcome
Oh, hey Ken Vert. And hey, uh, welcome
as well. And what are you making? I am
as well. And what are you making? I am
trying to get uh figure out how this
trying to get uh figure out how this
material science package works and get

it bound to puffer liib
build test.

I just want to get like a standalone
I just want to get like a standalone
file that I can build in the simplest
file that I can build in the simplest
way possible. I figure I'm missing some
way possible. I figure I'm missing some
args.
They have
They have
probably in CMake, right?
I It's annoying that I have to like go
I It's annoying that I have to like go
through and find
through and find
flags.
flags.
Oh no, this is a gigantic file, man.
Do they not just have um
Do they not just have um
GCC flags somewhere
GCC flags somewhere
or how to do this
or how to do this
flags? Okay,
I don't see any debt like any extra link
I don't see any debt like any extra link
stuff.
stuff.
Uh
we compile this thing.
we compile this thing.
Add library.
Well, they have all sources.
Alge.
Alge.
Okay. So, it links a whole bunch of
Okay. So, it links a whole bunch of
stuff.
stuff.
And it looks to me like
And it looks to me like
uh that's only set up with make or with
uh that's only set up with make or with
cmake at the moment.
cmake at the moment.
Am I understanding this right? It
Am I understanding this right? It
shouldn't I be able to just build
build an archive where it just has
build an archive where it just has
everything in it already?
everything in it already?
Yeah. The problem is I'm trying to
I just want to link in the static
I just want to link in the static
archive, don't I?
Yeah, I shouldn't have to add to one
Yeah, I shouldn't have to add to one
giant.
giant.
I guess it depends how it's set up,
I guess it depends how it's set up,
right? if if it compiles statically or
right? if if it compiles statically or
if it's like linking in everything.
Oh, wait. There's there is a thing here,
Oh, wait. There's there is a thing here,
is there?
It's got to be G++
It's got to be G++
because there's a C interface
because there's a C interface
to a C++ package, I believe.
Hey bet.
Hey bet.
Freaking C make, man.
Go to the traditional make tab.
Go to the traditional make tab.
Did I Did I miss that? Oh,
why are we making things?
why are we making things?
I'm just trying to figure out how to get
I'm just trying to figure out how to get
lamps to work. Bat material science
lamps to work. Bat material science
package.

I'm trying to figure out how to get like
I'm trying to figure out how to get like
just a simple GCC. I guess G++ working
just a simple GCC. I guess G++ working
would do it, right?
Just compile this with clang.
got C++ in it.
One giant thing.
Is it clang++? I thought clang just base
Is it clang++? I thought clang just base
all worked for um D or C++. I thought
all worked for um D or C++. I thought
the package just had both in it.

Oh, where is it in the

We're just trying to figure out how to

get the package to even build.
get the package to even build.
We have some reasonable ideas on what to
We have some reasonable ideas on what to
do, but um
I don't know there was there was
I don't know there was there was
information here library of C++ and
information here library of C++ and
executable
voice of compiler There.
Okay, it is clang. Bad.
For some reason, I thought clang just by
For some reason, I thought clang just by
default had um both compilers.
The GCC is fine.
Build the executable and library.
You shouldn't have to
I shouldn't have to rebuild lamps. I
I shouldn't have to rebuild lamps. I
have it built.
I'm not modifying the library.
Yeah, I should just be able to link it,
Yeah, I should just be able to link it,
right?
right?
Wait for creating a shared library. All
Wait for creating a shared library. All
the libraries it depend on to be
the libraries it depend on to be
compatibility
compatibility
the case for all libraries included with
the case for all libraries included with
lamps.
Okay.
Okay.
Why is this not
like something is just not clicking?
like something is just not clicking?
I'm just not understanding something
I'm just not understanding something
about how this package works.
Oh, I should probably
I don't think I should be including
I don't think I should be including
source library.h, right?
source library.h, right?
Yeah, it's probably that I need I
Yeah, it's probably that I need I
probably need to like add the link flag
probably need to like add the link flag
and just include library.h or whatever,
and just include library.h or whatever,
don't I?
Yeah, it's it's probably something like
Yeah, it's it's probably something like
something like this, right? And then you
something like this, right? And then you
add like L L lamps or something.
Yeah. No.
Hey, did you
Hey, did you

Doing a 10k tomorrow with some hills.
Still deadlift well enough at least.
Hang on. What? Oh, create build.
Oh, okay. So, there's a flag.
then you install.
Hey, major
Okay. So now you do this I suppose
then you can compile with GCC and L
then you can compile with GCC and L
lamps
lamps
what we would want.
And now it's a system package. Right?
Now we can do like this.
I think this is right. Then we can
I think this is right. Then we can
compile with just GCC
compile with just GCC
because I'm just use I'm just writing C

It's probably going to be the most
It's probably going to be the most
difficult part honestly is just figuring

out the basics of the package.
Shouldn't be that hard to get it bound

by the big company name, you don't

actually invest in it. And like also the
actually invest in it. And like also the

it would only make sense pretty much if

something that works roughly the way

that you'd expect.
And frankly, I don't even think that I
And frankly, I don't even think that I
will be the one to make a library for

that uh when RL gets to that point.
Maybe I will be.
After all, it would be kind of sad if uh
After all, it would be kind of sad if uh
you know, Puffer actually gets RL to be

somebody else just like, "Okay, cool.
somebody else just like, "Okay, cool.
Now we can build the dumb library
Now we can build the dumb library
because everything is solved." Not
because everything is solved." Not

Even for more mature stuff like yeah you
Even for more mature stuff like yeah you
can have more sort of reusable
can have more sort of reusable

still too high level for my liking even

if that were the case the best possible

situation.
Okay, so we have this
Let's see if this does something.
Okay, so
try this then.
try this then.
Okay, so there's no lamps library.h.
Kind of what I expected.
Double check it exists. All right.
Double check it exists. All right.
Should have installed it globally,
Should have installed it globally,
right? That's kind of what we're
right? That's kind of what we're
expecting.
Yeah, it's not there.
from the llama CP.
I mean, that's also possible. If
I mean, that's also possible. If
somebody wants to build a front end on
somebody wants to build a front end on
top of Puffer, that's also kind of fine
top of Puffer, that's also kind of fine
by me, right? But it's kind of difficult
by me, right? But it's kind of difficult
to do that with the way that Puffer is
to do that with the way that Puffer is
at the moment. It's really not designed
at the moment. It's really not designed
for that. I mean that's something I
for that. I mean that's something I

what happened was uh the system package

Hey, boxing.
What's the plan for today? You're
What's the plan for today? You're
catching the end of this, man. Been
catching the end of this, man. Been
doing uh material science simulation
doing uh material science simulation
work all day.
You think we could go over papers?
Sure.
Sure.
I'll jump in the Discord for a little
I'll jump in the Discord for a little
bit.
bit.
Are catching me at the end of uh a very
Are catching me at the end of uh a very
long week. So, we'll see how coherent I
long week. So, we'll see how coherent I
am. Do my best.
test this voice.
There we are. I am in voice.
Hello.
Let me fix the mics
devices.
devices.
Yeah, hang on.
say something.
say something.
One 1212. Roger. Roger.
One 1212. Roger. Roger.
Yeah, that's good.
Yeah, that's good.
All right. Well, what papers you got?
All right. Well, what papers you got?
Um, yeah, I've selected a few. I think
Um, yeah, I've selected a few. I think
uh there's like uh three of them that
uh there's like uh three of them that
are very interesting. I'm not sure
are very interesting. I'm not sure
exactly how much you think you have time
exactly how much you think you have time
to go through, but yeah, I think three
to go through, but yeah, I think three
is probably Yeah. Um yeah,
is probably Yeah. Um yeah,
I'll link them in the discord.
The first one is uh this one.
The first one is uh this one.
Um
Um
they've basically the issue they tried
they've basically the issue they tried
to tackle is that uh you know mutual
to tackle is that uh you know mutual
information skill discovery is easily
information skill discovery is easily
fable
fable
um in the general in the discord.
because you're gonna you're gonna throw
because you're gonna you're gonna throw
me heavy math at the end of the stream
me heavy math at the end of the stream
at the end of a long week. Let's see
at the end of a long week. Let's see
what this
what this
you know if you can if you can't do it
you know if you can if you can't do it
that's completely okay. I'm going to try
that's completely okay. I'm going to try
with this.
with this.
We have
it's revised skill just
this thing here.
I don't think that this thing fundament
I don't think that this thing fundament
works, but I think it's a good auxiliary
works, but I think it's a good auxiliary
going
What do you mind just elaborating a
What do you mind just elaborating a
little bit on why you think this
little bit on why you think this
wouldn't work?
wouldn't work?
Well, I mean, this has just been
Well, I mean, this has just been
something that's been done for a very
something that's been done for a very
long time and none of the like no reward
long time and none of the like no reward
RL stuff has really done anything all
RL stuff has really done anything all
that impressive.
that impressive.
And let me
They named their algorithm Ella.
Is this entirely humanoids?
Is this entirely humanoids?
Uh yeah. So most of the papers are
Uh yeah. So most of the papers are
mostly focusing on robotics. Yeah.
mostly focusing on robotics. Yeah.
Because I guess this is where the main
Because I guess this is where the main
uh issues come from.
So the you know the main issues I found
So the you know the main issues I found
across all the papers that the x-axis is
across all the papers that the x-axis is
always in steps. Uh I've never found a
always in steps. Uh I've never found a
single paper where they where they're
single paper where they where they're
they bring on the time constraint but
they bring on the time constraint but
welcome to academia.
Okay. This is
Hey, but yeah, I think they do
here.
It's the definition
code any good? Let's see.
where the uh
where the uh
yes their code is in test. Uh you can
yes their code is in test. Uh you can
see the main and
yeah I mean it's better than the last
yeah I mean it's better than the last
one I showed you. Is this based on is
one I showed you. Is this based on is
this min or what is it?
this min or what is it?
The main algorithm is in IoT.
The main algorithm is in IoT.
I'm not sure exactly what you're looking
I'm not sure exactly what you're looking
for, but the the main algorithm logic is
for, but the the main algorithm logic is
in IoT and the main uh training logic is
in IoT and the main uh training logic is
in test, but yeah.
Yeah, you have the LSD,
Yeah, you have the LSD,
you have the LSD Python file uh right in
you have the LSD Python file uh right in
the IoT folder.
Definitely
is Z like skill back.
is Z like skill back.
Z is the lightened variable uh of the of
Z is the lightened variable uh of the of
the it's the skill.
Yes, I think yeah, I think that is
Yes, I think yeah, I think that is
uh let me see because in some of those
uh let me see because in some of those
papers that they don't onehood it but
papers that they don't onehood it but
yeah I think most of the paper is one
yeah I think most of the paper is one
hot
I mean if I had to simplify it the way I
I mean if I had to simplify it the way I
understood is that is DN but just with a
understood is that is DN but just with a
lipshit constraint to make sure that you
lipshit constraint to make sure that you
know the skills aren't just easily
know the skills aren't just easily
distinguishable
distinguishable
without highly different trajectories.
without highly different trajectories.
That's the way I see it.
That's the way I see it.
That is what you want.
Is it worth it? Is what worth it?
Oh, I only recommend that people who
Oh, I only recommend that people who
know that they want to do a
know that they want to do a
general
probably just link me all the papers.
probably just link me all the papers.
That will probably be more effective.
That will probably be more effective.
Yeah, sure. I could then uh I'll I'll
Yeah, sure. I could then uh I'll I'll
link them to you ranking them from what
link them to you ranking them from what
I think is interesting. Um,
and this card is it good for you?
and this card is it good for you?
Yeah.
Okay.
So that's if you're interested in my
So that's if you're interested in my
text. It's basically like an advanced
text. It's basically like an advanced
version.
version.
It's funny how like literally every
It's funny how like literally every
single one of these papers has oh the
single one of these papers has oh the
other methods do nothing and ours does
other methods do nothing and ours does
everything.
everything.
Yeah. So one of the big issues I found
Yeah. So one of the big issues I found
is that most of them also have hard time
is that most of them also have hard time
um reproducing the results to the
um reproducing the results to the
previous ones.
Um so I agree with you. It's a bit weird
Um so I agree with you. It's a bit weird
on that.
Were you um interested into map elite
Were you um interested into map elite
sort of stuff or did you think it it
sort of stuff or did you think it it
wasn't going anywhere? Uh so the issue
wasn't going anywhere? Uh so the issue
with maple each is again that you're
with maple each is again that you're
training separate policies
training separate policies
because I found one that is kind of
because I found one that is kind of
doing some sort of map edit stuff but in
doing some sort of map edit stuff but in
two latent space uh representation of
two latent space uh representation of
the parameters or something but it it
the parameters or something but it it
seems quite interesting
seems quite interesting
works very very well in places but it's
works very very well in places but it's
you're training you're training separate
you're training you're training separate
policies so you're splitting your data
policies so you're splitting your data
horribly.
horribly.
I see
I see
you also have to define like the axes of
you also have to define like the axes of
variation
the the three. Okay. So I just linked to
the the three. Okay. So I just linked to
you a last one and those are to me the
you a last one and those are to me the
most interesting ones. Then all the
most interesting ones. Then all the
others basically had big issues when I
others basically had big issues when I
looked into it. Um most of the time it
looked into it. Um most of the time it
was
was
just highly specific domain knowledge
just highly specific domain knowledge
input into the extreme uh intrinsic
input into the extreme uh intrinsic
reward somehow. So I just gave up on the
And there's one last one
that one. I'm still a bit suspicious
that one. I'm still a bit suspicious
about whether or not they've put like a
about whether or not they've put like a
lot of um do knowledge into how they
lot of um do knowledge into how they
create the latent space of the state
create the latent space of the state
space cuz they basically
thing
thing
doesn't show
doesn't show
thing only shows coverage on this one m
thing only shows coverage on this one m
Okay.
Um, Ron, I linked the papers in Discord,
Um, Ron, I linked the papers in Discord,
but I can link them in the chat also if
but I can link them in the chat also if
you're interested.
you're interested.
They're in Discord. Discord.gg/puffer.
They're in Discord. Discord.gg/puffer.
GL puffer.
the best.
Good.
what you're looking at when you're going
what you're looking at when you're going
I'm just trying to see I'm just trying
I'm just trying to see I'm just trying
to go through and see if like what like
to go through and see if like what like
what results various different are
what results various different are
Okay.
This thing
This thing
work.
The thing is it's basically the same
The thing is it's basically the same
guy. So
guy. So
yeah.
Well, actually kind of funny then, isn't
Well, actually kind of funny then, isn't
it? Because
two labs are basic thing.
two labs are basic thing.
This says
This says
they say that.
Yes.
Yes.
SD
that should be CSD the way they uh
that should be CSD the way they uh
printed.
Yes, I think so.
Yeah, it's a different one. Um,
Yeah, it's a different one. Um,
CSD is another one and I just linked it
CSD is another one and I just linked it
in the Discord right now.
That's it.
That's it.
Follow up one.
Okay. Isn't this the same thing? Hang
Okay. Isn't this the same thing? Hang
on. This is the same thing as this
on. This is the same thing as this
the direct followup.
Yeah, I think it is basically.
Yeah, I think it is basically.
So the difference is they basically the
So the difference is they basically the
same algorithm but in latent space in a
same algorithm but in latent space in a
different uh in a different metric space
different uh in a different metric space
isn't this the same they have this and
isn't this the same they have this and
isn't it just summed over time or is
isn't it just summed over time or is
there bigger difference
there bigger difference
this is a sum over time
you.
you.
Yeah, this looks like a sum. Isn't this
Yeah, this looks like a sum. Isn't this
just a straight sum over time
just a straight sum over time
difference?
I think you're right. Actually,
I think if you implement one of these
I think if you implement one of these
like these, you kind of get both of
like these, you kind of get both of
these.
these.
Oh. Oh, yeah. at uh children. Yeah.
Oh. Oh, yeah. at uh children. Yeah.
Now, I don't know if this is going to be
Now, I don't know if this is going to be
slow if you do this or not, right? I
slow if you do this or not, right? I
think you can maybe make it not slow. I
think you can maybe make it not slow. I
think you kind of turn this into um
think you kind of turn this into um
you might be able to turn this into a
you might be able to turn this into a
sum or something.
sum or something.
I think you can do this as like a
I think you can do this as like a
cumulative sum over a segment.
cumulative sum over a segment.
Yes. So, I think the big difference with
Yes. So, I think the big difference with
us is that we won't have full
us is that we won't have full
trajectories for an entire episode,
trajectories for an entire episode,
right? So, if I do this
right? So, if I do this
Yeah. Right. Yeah. Exactly right. But I
Yeah. Right. Yeah. Exactly right. But I
think it's going to be good enough, but
think it's going to be good enough, but
we need to have a long enough segment if
we need to have a long enough segment if
you put this too small. Yeah. Right.
you put this too small. Yeah. Right.
I agree.
Because one of the things you said to me
Because one of the things you said to me
last time was also that uh uh you need
last time was also that uh uh you need
to do something trajectory wise,
to do something trajectory wise,
otherwise it's not meaningful enough. Um
otherwise it's not meaningful enough. Um
And so the only way to
And so the only way to
you know I thought about what you said
you know I thought about what you said
that we couldn't interfere through the
that we couldn't interfere through the
states and so I think most of those
states and so I think most of those
papers just uh work around this by um
papers just uh work around this by um
building an intrinsic reward right it's
building an intrinsic reward right it's
just
just
because you can't do that then you have
because you can't do that then you have
to force it some somehow
to force it some somehow
uh and that's what they do most of them
uh and that's what they do most of them
what is this doing.
Uh, which one is it?
Uh, which one is it?
Also, this
Also, this
actions on cybernetic.
Yeah. So, those one Okay. Yeah. So those
Yeah. So, those one Okay. Yeah. So those
ones are basically to my understanding
ones are basically to my understanding
they basically added an exploration term
they basically added an exploration term
to the skill discovery uh reward.
[Music]
[Music]
probably like the best known products.
Am I missing something or is this one
Am I missing something or is this one
pretty easy? Oh, this an LSD.
Yeah, I think they're uh very very
Yeah, I think they're uh very very
similar.
Just add an encoder somewhere, right?
Just add an encoder somewhere, right?
Add like an extra little encoder and
Add like an extra little encoder and
then you just do this in the train step,
then you just do this in the train step,
right?
right?
In the train step, you have to do this
In the train step, you have to do this
extra loss thing. Yeah, pretty much it.
extra loss thing. Yeah, pretty much it.
This a reward or is this uh
This a reward or is this uh
differentiable? Hang on.
in LSD or you're in Metra, right? Yeah,
in LSD or you're in Metra, right? Yeah,
Metra.
Metra.
Is this a reward or is this
Is this a reward or is this
differentiated through?
I don't want the AI to summarize
I don't want the AI to summarize
wrong.
Yeah, to me it's a reward.
Yeah, to me it's a reward.
You think this is a reward?
Let me see if I can find
Let me see if I can find
How do they train this component?
minimum. What's this temporal distance?
minimum. What's this temporal distance?
Hang on.
I mean to me this is a reward the policy
I mean to me this is a reward the policy
but then the discriminator is uh trying
but then the discriminator is uh trying
everything is differentiable. So for
everything is differentiable. So for
this one is it's it's trained through
this one is it's it's trained through
grad and descent.
Okay. So you have to you just compute
Okay. So you have to you just compute
this thing then in the train loop. I
this thing then in the train loop. I
think
think
uh you it in the train loop before you
uh you it in the train loop before you
like
like
have you have to compute this thing in
have you have to compute this thing in
the train loop to add to the reward
the train loop to add to the reward
before you do advantage.
before you do advantage.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Enjoy your studying journey. New follow

We're looking for things to pull in from
We're looking for things to pull in from

last few years.
We do have resources for people learning
We do have resources for people learning
deep uh like just general deep learning
deep uh like just general deep learning
though.
I' I've been doing deep learning since I
I' I've been doing deep learning since I
was like 16. This is uh I mean this is
was like 16. This is uh I mean this is
like obviously not an area that I spend
like obviously not an area that I spend
a lot of time in this thing. If you are
a lot of time in this thing. If you are
new,
most of the stuff around here is RL, but
most of the stuff around here is RL, but
check the X. Same as the uh Twitch
check the X. Same as the uh Twitch
handle,

have guides for general ML and for RL.
To me, the way we would implement those
To me, the way we would implement those
is very very similar to the way you
is very very similar to the way you
would implement.
would implement.
I think so, isn't it? Like they're all
I think so, isn't it? Like they're all
kind of pretty similar.
kind of pretty similar.
Yes.
Yes.
I would just branch three hack it and
I would just branch three hack it and
like the thing is I think if I'm not
like the thing is I think if I'm not
wrong here and I'm exhausted like I've
wrong here and I'm exhausted like I've
been like it's been a long week but I'm
been like it's been a long week but I'm
pretty damn sure that if you just
pretty damn sure that if you just
if you just set t to one you get LSD.
if you just set t to one you get LSD.
Don't you

Dax is kind of a freaking mess though. I
Dax is kind of a freaking mess though. I

Yeah, it has a lot of backup by Google

if you're at Google. If you're not at
if you're at Google. If you're not at
Google, then everything is a mess and uh
Google, then everything is a mess and uh
it's on you to figure it out.
Yes. So you basically think that those
Yes. So you basically think that those
are interesting
are interesting
and if they're the same thing or because
and if they're the same thing or because
I don't know if they is defined
I don't know if they is defined
differently
if five is defined the same. They
if five is defined the same. They
release code with this one.
release code with this one.
Let me see.
Let me see.
Yes, they did.
Yes, they did.
Yeah, they did.
Yeah, they did.
Yeah. Sorry, I don't have all the
Yeah. Sorry, I don't have all the
details in hand. I basically went
details in hand. I basically went
through so many of them. But uh
through so many of them. But uh
oh, they actually have a blog post as
oh, they actually have a blog post as
well.
The big issue I have with all all of
The big issue I have with all all of
those ones is that they train first in
those ones is that they train first in
the unsupervised way and then they go
the unsupervised way and then they go
down for downstream tasks. Uh I don't
down for downstream tasks. Uh I don't
think that's something that is efficient
think that's something that is efficient
enough.
enough.
Just mix the objectives.
Just mix the objectives.
Yeah. So you would basically mix the
Yeah. So you would basically mix the
rewards, right? So you would probably
rewards, right? So you would probably
have like the And I I guess my intuition
have like the And I I guess my intuition
says that you would start to have most
says that you would start to have most
weight to the interesting rewards first
weight to the interesting rewards first
and then slowly have it decay and give
and then slowly have it decay and give
more and more strength to the
more and more strength to the
environment reward.

finished my PhD at MIT like a little
finished my PhD at MIT like a little
over a year ago. Uh I'm working on a

I need to like actually go through this
I need to like actually go through this

Oh, yeah. You didn't see that. So, we
Oh, yeah. You didn't see that. So, we
got uh we got puffer bound to lamps,
got uh we got puffer bound to lamps,

about this as well, which is awesome.
about this as well, which is awesome.
Um, we basically have a thing where we
Um, we basically have a thing where we
can steer atoms around, have them be
can steer atoms around, have them be
simulated with uh, lamps and we have to
simulated with uh, lamps and we have to
like get the forces and stuff to be
like get the forces and stuff to be
actually realistic. So, that's next. And
actually realistic. So, that's next. And
what we're going to do is do stuff like
what we're going to do is do stuff like

how to hit people?
I mean in LSD I didn't find anything
I mean in LSD I didn't find anything
archively suspicious to be honest.
Okay. And did anything in um

us to

Second, folks.
I think we're done dropping frames.

I'm not dropping frames any seconds.
I'm not dropping frames any seconds.
Okay. Yeah. Um so if you agree with me,
Okay. Yeah. Um so if you agree with me,
I think the idea was that, you know, we
I think the idea was that, you know, we
go through a couple of papers. If you
go through a couple of papers. If you
think they're interesting enough, then I
think they're interesting enough, then I
just uh uh I put some time in and try to
just uh uh I put some time in and try to
implement them with buffer.
implement them with buffer.
I don't like I don't look like going by

generally do good stuff and it looks to

me like they have a continuous line of

And the the nice thing is if you

complicated.

I would like it if they had if all these
I would like it if they had if all these
papers had more baselines against each
papers had more baselines against each

Yeah, nobody else has like independent

Um,
Um,
did I miss something or does nobody have

No, I think uh the most common ground is

I see not CSD.
I see not CSD.
Yeah, CSD is a different one.

Yeah. So, like they all have baselines.
Yeah. So, like they all have baselines.
The only thing that's a little sketch is
The only thing that's a little sketch is
like some of them do they both have bad
like some of them do they both have bad
l? This one is the only one that has bad
l? This one is the only one that has bad
base.

Yeah. So, this one has a bad base. Like
Yeah. So, this one has a bad base. Like
this one says that this is not that well
this one says that this is not that well
not even actually no it has it better
not even actually no it has it better
than Diane. So still fine. This says
than Diane. So still fine. This says
that it's like a good chunk better than
that it's like a good chunk better than
Diane or else. And then this one says
Diane or else. And then this one says
hang on.
It went by train cur. Well,
It went by train cur. Well,
yeah. The the biggest sketchy thing I
yeah. The the biggest sketchy thing I
found across all of them is that they uh
found across all of them is that they uh
really focus on state exploration, which
really focus on state exploration, which
is great, but there's very little uh
is great, but there's very little uh
done about actual rewards and downstream
done about actual rewards and downstream
tasks.
tasks.
Why didn't you join an AI lab?
Uh because everybody's doing the same
Uh because everybody's doing the same
bloody thing, Ronaldo. Everybody's just
bloody thing, Ronaldo. Everybody's just
doing LLMs. like they put 99% of the
doing LLMs. like they put 99% of the
focus into one area. They're like
focus into one area. They're like
completely missing out all this other
completely missing out all this other
stuff in RL. Like they're just obvious
stuff in RL. Like they're just obvious
hard problems across all industries that
hard problems across all industries that
are not going to be solved with LLMs.
are not going to be solved with LLMs.
Just nobody's doing it. Oh, I am doing
Just nobody's doing it. Oh, I am doing
it.
Actually, this is kind of a closer
Actually, this is kind of a closer
comparison, right?
comparison, right?
This would be worth looking at because
This would be worth looking at because
these these claim to have very similar
these these claim to have very similar
results, right?
results, right?
Results. This one the results kind of
Results. This one the results kind of
suck on, don't they?
suck on, don't they?
This one has
This one has
Well, I don't actually know if this one
Well, I don't actually know if this one
sucks. At the very least they don't show
yeah they don't behaviors they only show
yeah they don't behaviors they only show
that one I was a bit a bit suspicious
that one I was a bit a bit suspicious
because the result they show on uh so
because the result they show on uh so
they benchmark against and uh it's uh
they benchmark against and uh it's uh
the results seemed a bit lower than on
the results seemed a bit lower than on
the original so
the original so
let's say if we go through these these
let's say if we go through these these
two seem to show similar results right
two seem to show similar results right
like look this is the same task
like look this is the same task
this
this
this All right.
This
This
humanoid
does actually claim better results I
does actually claim better results I
think. I don't know. Pixels.
Okay. So, we actually do have to look at
Okay. So, we actually do have to look at
the difference between these two because
the difference between these two because
I think they're claiming quite similar
I think they're claiming quite similar
results.
I think generally the other the Metro
I think generally the other the Metro
one has better benchmarks and
one has better benchmarks and
everything.
everything.

So if the first author is the same, then

This is a followup.
This is a followup.
Why did they not their own thing?
Why did they not their own thing?
Wait, what the hell? Why did they not
Wait, what the hell? Why did they not
benchmark their own paper
benchmark their own paper
like from before?
Good point.
Good point.
That's sketchy as hell.
Maybe there was a review or something.
Maybe there was a review or something.
Thanks, Ronaldo.
I mean, maybe Sham I don't know who

Oh, okay.
Oh, okay.
Peter Aiel is a profit Berkeley. Spill

be a prophet Berkeley. Very close labs
be a prophet Berkeley. Very close labs
right next to
what is now.
what is now.
Um
Um
yeah. So the first like authors are
yeah. So the first like authors are
always the
always the
Okay. So then you're
Okay. So then you're
Yes. Then you're very right. Okay. So
Yes. Then you're very right. Okay. So
the the first um the first version of
the the first um the first version of
Metra was in 2023 and the first version
Metra was in 2023 and the first version
of CSD was in the same year. So
of CSD was in the same year. So
um
actually Metro is like a okay a couple
actually Metro is like a okay a couple
of months older than CST. So it still
of months older than CST. So it still
raises the question.
raises the question.
Yeah. If you look at the first versions,
Yeah. If you look at the first versions,
uh the last versions of Metro is 2024,
uh the last versions of Metro is 2024,
but the first one was do they do
but the first one was do they do
different
different
at the same time
at the same time
topic
topic
and not compare to himself.
I guess where's the algorithm?
I
I
mean they site in Metra they site CSD.
mean they site in Metra they site CSD.
So
So
okay
okay
that's weird right?
Is this am I wrong or is
Trying to see how this is actually
Trying to see how this is actually
computed.
I mean to me it's very similar, right?
I mean to me it's very similar, right?
Yeah. Hang on. Cuz it's a it's a state
Yeah. Hang on. Cuz it's a it's a state
based as well.
Well, you're looking at
Well, you're looking at
X and Y. Now you're looking at DSD,
X and Y. Now you're looking at DSD,
right?
right?
Oh, wait.
Yeah, sorry. The stream is
Yeah, sorry. The stream is
still here. It's still
still here. It's still
They don't show the computation. This
What's this inverse?
What's this inverse matrix?
Sorry, I lost the strangers. I can't
Sorry, I lost the strangers. I can't
really see.
really see.
It's okay. Hang on.
Yeah, you have it on page five
Yeah, you have it on page five
or the code. Sorry.
Which paper is this? We're looking
Which paper is this? We're looking
through a bunch of SE parks. Um like
through a bunch of SE parks. Um like
exploration slash diver
diver.
Okay. So this like basically it looks
Okay. So this like basically it looks
like like all this code he's been
like like all this code he's been
building up on this ford.
building up on this ford.
Um,
Okay. So, actually these are both
Okay. So, actually these are both
follow-ups to um LSD. He did two
follow-ups to um LSD. He did two
separate follow-ups to pay.
I think we just need to understand the
I think we just need to understand the
uh the difference because he has two
uh the difference because he has two
very similar papers that are both
very similar papers that are both
follow-ups to him earlier paper
follow-ups to him earlier paper
between CSC and Metro.
between CSC and Metro.
Yes.
I think it's likely you're going to end
I think it's likely you're going to end
up wanting to all of these
up wanting to all of these
and they're going to be very similar.
Yeah, if you're okay with that, I think
Yeah, if you're okay with that, I think
it's probably also going to be better
it's probably also going to be better
for you in terms of uh time. Uh like I
for you in terms of uh time. Uh like I
might start implementing the LST and
might start implementing the LST and
then move on, try implementing.
then move on, try implementing.
There's one thing I noticed.
There's one thing I noticed.
Uhhuh. You're going to want to just
check the code for locomotion
says right here theation of LSD in here
says right here theation of LSD in here
is
is
much better.
So if you're going to like the this is
So if you're going to like the this is
the thing to start with I'd use this
the thing to start with I'd use this
one. This is like He basically tweaked
one. This is like He basically tweaked
his original and then added some new
his original and then added some new
stuff, right? Added like this these
stuff, right? Added like this these
changes and now it's the new algorithm.
changes and now it's the new algorithm.
So the it's the combination of these
So the it's the combination of these
improvements
improvements
plus the algorithmic uh changes. I would
plus the algorithmic uh changes. I would
look here
look here
like right here.
Um, yeah, your stream dropped again.
Um, yeah, your stream dropped again.
Dropping.
Dropping.
Not sure if it I don't think it's me
Not sure if it I don't think it's me
because I still hear you on Discord, but
because I still hear you on Discord, but
I haven't dropped any frames
before.
before.
Okay. Well, I think that this is most
Okay. Well, I think that this is most
likely
most likely the play. Now,
most likely the play. Now,
pretty much all of these have some sort
pretty much all of these have some sort
of state difference of encoders, right?
of state difference of encoders, right?
Like encoder state difference thing. Um,
Like encoder state difference thing. Um,
what you're going to want to do is
there's a Diane branch. Okay. It's kind
there's a Diane branch. Okay. It's kind
of old, but you can see it.
of old, but you can see it.
Yeah, I looked at it. uh couple of weeks
Yeah, I looked at it. uh couple of weeks
ago.
ago.
It has like the
paparella in here. Oh,
paparella in here. Oh,
it was the old one. So, it's still demo.
it was the old one. So, it's still demo.
I think you still had the demo fight,
I think you still had the demo fight,
right?
right?
Yeah. Where's up?
Okay. So, this is
Okay. So, this is
Yeah, I have all like the Diane stuff in
Yeah, I have all like the Diane stuff in
here. If you look,
here. If you look,
I think the main thing is
Yeah. So the main thing with Diane is
Yeah. So the main thing with Diane is
like the sampling from the like the
like the sampling from the like the
sampling of the indices
computation of the loss.
I think you have to
I think you have to
I think you have to do it in this train
I think you have to do it in this train
function though. I think you have to
function though. I think you have to
recomputee it back the advantage.
But yeah, this is this is what I would
But yeah, this is this is what I would
start with. I'd start with probably like
start with. I'd start with probably like
the of them. You're going to want an
the of them. You're going to want an
environment, by the way, that's just
environment, by the way, that's just
like good for this type of research. I
like good for this type of research. I
would just hack on.
would just hack on.
Yeah, I' either just like Yeah, do that
Yeah, I' either just like Yeah, do that
and hack on that.
and hack on that.
You might even just have like might even
You might even just have like might even
just like make an empty map one. Modify
just like make an empty map one. Modify
that. Make an empty map and see they can
that. Make an empty map and see they can
go in different directions or whatever.
How's the RLM? RLM. I'm not I'm not a
How's the RLM? RLM. I'm not I'm not a
I'm not doing a master. Um,
yeah, there's been a ton of progress
doing material science today.
All right.
All right.
Yeah, I think that it's like fairly
Yeah, I think that it's like fairly
likely that there will be something
likely that there will be something
here. um the author of Dian actually.
Oh that was Eisen Batch I think for D.
Oh that was Eisen Batch I think for D.
Oh okay who also is thousand.
Oh let's see
Oh let's see
I think if one of those papers like
I think if one of those papers like
actually replicates then they probably
actually replicates then they probably
all will. You know what I mean? Same
all will. You know what I mean? Same
author.
author.
Yep.
Yep.
Like built off the same code base. I
Like built off the same code base. I
think that what I would do is I would
think that what I would do is I would
spend a little time just getting the
spend a little time just getting the
basics of like these delta state metrics
basics of like these delta state metrics
in and make sure that's right like a
in and make sure that's right like a
super simple environment or just like
super simple environment or just like
policy has to go to a place right or

like
like
even do the no reward version if you
even do the no reward version if you
want like you should be able to train
want like you should be able to train
that in 30 seconds or less.
that in 30 seconds or less.
So you should actually have a very very
So you should actually have a very very
quick iteration cycle on this
quick iteration cycle on this
and uh if you've got time over the next
and uh if you've got time over the next
few weeks do that then I can help you on
few weeks do that then I can help you on
the actual experimentation side once you
the actual experimentation side once you
stuff just like basically port up my old
stuff just like basically port up my old
Dian stuff and hack on that. That'll
Dian stuff and hack on that. That'll
give you a basis for this
give you a basis for this
but don't use dian use at least like
but don't use dian use at least like
oh ms material science. Yeah yeah yeah
oh ms material science. Yeah yeah yeah
we'll do 28.
we'll do 28.
All right, cool. Um, yeah, thanks for

dropping by. This will be very useful if
dropping by. This will be very useful if
you get this
you get this
uh if you get this to work. I think this
uh if you get this to work. I think this
will unlock quite a bit of stuff.
will unlock quite a bit of stuff.
Okay. Yeah, that's quite exciting. I
Okay. Yeah, that's quite exciting. I
might be a bit slow for the next 3 weeks

if you're interested in that
the Discord lots of dev going on
the Discord lots of dev going on
definitely just that
definitely just that
great. All right. Anyways, we were doing
great. All right. Anyways, we were doing
material science stuff before. Going to
material science stuff before. Going to
take one last look at this stuff before
take one last look at this stuff before
I call it and go for dinner.
Right.
So, I was having trouble getting this
So, I was having trouble getting this
thing to run with
more particles, bigger space.
Fix this real quick.

They're just on my X.
So the result here should be that all

working.
I am both a condensed matter physicist

I've gotten lamps, right? And I've
I've gotten lamps, right? And I've
hooked it up to puffer lib as a puffer

I don't know there was there was

Okay, it is clang. Bad.
For some reason, I thought clang just by

The GCC is fine.
Build the executable and library.
You shouldn't have to
I shouldn't have to rebuild lamps. I
I shouldn't have to rebuild lamps. I
have it built.
I'm not modifying the library.
Yeah, I should just be able to link it,

I'm just not understanding something

Oh, I should probably
I don't think I should be including

Yeah, it's probably that I need I
Yeah, it's probably that I need I

don't I?
Yeah, it's it's probably something like

something like this, right? And then you
something like this, right? And then you
add like L L lamps or something.
Yeah. No.

Hang on. What? Oh, create build.
Oh, okay. So, there's a flag.
then you install.
Hey, major
Okay. So now you do this I suppose
then you can compile with GCC and L
then you can compile with GCC and L
lamps
lamps
what we would want.
And now it's a system package. Right?
Now we can do like this.
I think this is right. Then we can

initially is can we steer around

like if I can get this to work where you

can set velocities and it behaves as

expected, then what I can do is I can
take this code, I can put it into an RL

And if we can do that,

This gave me new code, I guess.

right?
I think it just gave me the exact same

is that most of them also have hard time
is that most of them also have hard time
um reproducing the results to the

on that.
Were you um interested into map elite
Were you um interested into map elite
sort of stuff or did you think it it
sort of stuff or did you think it it
wasn't going anywhere? Uh so the issue
wasn't going anywhere? Uh so the issue
with maple each is again that you're
with maple each is again that you're
training separate policies
training separate policies
because I found one that is kind of
because I found one that is kind of
doing some sort of map edit stuff but in

works very very well in places but it's
works very very well in places but it's
you're training you're training separate
you're training you're training separate
policies so you're splitting your data

horribly.
horribly.
I see
I see
you also have to define like the axes of
you also have to define like the axes of

the the three. Okay. So I just linked to
the the three. Okay. So I just linked to
you a last one and those are to me the

others basically had big issues when I
looked into it. Um most of the time it
looked into it. Um most of the time it
was
was
just highly specific domain knowledge
just highly specific domain knowledge
input into the extreme uh intrinsic

that one. I'm still a bit suspicious
that one. I'm still a bit suspicious
about whether or not they've put like a

Um, Ron, I linked the papers in Discord,

what you're looking at when you're going
what you're looking at when you're going
I'm just trying to see I'm just trying
I'm just trying to see I'm just trying
to go through and see if like what like
to go through and see if like what like
what results various different are

Okay.
This thing
This thing
work.
The thing is it's basically the same
The thing is it's basically the same
guy. So
guy. So
yeah.
Well, actually kind of funny then, isn't
Well, actually kind of funny then, isn't
it? Because
two labs are basic thing.
two labs are basic thing.
This says
This says
they say that.
Yes.
Yes.
SD
that should be CSD the way they uh
that should be CSD the way they uh
printed.
Yes, I think so.
Yeah, it's a different one. Um,
Yeah, it's a different one. Um,
CSD is another one and I just linked it
CSD is another one and I just linked it
in the Discord right now.
That's it.
That's it.
Follow up one.
Okay. Isn't this the same thing? Hang
Okay. Isn't this the same thing? Hang
on. This is the same thing as this
on. This is the same thing as this
the direct followup.
Yeah, I think it is basically.
Yeah, I think it is basically.
So the difference is they basically the
So the difference is they basically the
same algorithm but in latent space in a
same algorithm but in latent space in a
different uh in a different metric space
different uh in a different metric space
isn't this the same they have this and
isn't this the same they have this and
isn't it just summed over time or is
isn't it just summed over time or is
there bigger difference
there bigger difference
this is a sum over time
you.
you.
Yeah, this looks like a sum. Isn't this
Yeah, this looks like a sum. Isn't this
just a straight sum over time
just a straight sum over time
difference?
I think you're right. Actually,
I think if you implement one of these
I think if you implement one of these
like these, you kind of get both of
like these, you kind of get both of
these.
these.
Oh. Oh, yeah. at uh children. Yeah.
Oh. Oh, yeah. at uh children. Yeah.
Now, I don't know if this is going to be
Now, I don't know if this is going to be
slow if you do this or not, right? I
slow if you do this or not, right? I
think you can maybe make it not slow. I
think you can maybe make it not slow. I
think you kind of turn this into um
think you kind of turn this into um
you might be able to turn this into a
you might be able to turn this into a
sum or something.
sum or something.
I think you can do this as like a
I think you can do this as like a
cumulative sum over a segment.
cumulative sum over a segment.
Yes. So, I think the big difference with
Yes. So, I think the big difference with
us is that we won't have full
us is that we won't have full
trajectories for an entire episode,
trajectories for an entire episode,
right? So, if I do this
right? So, if I do this
Yeah. Right. Yeah. Exactly right. But I
Yeah. Right. Yeah. Exactly right. But I
think it's going to be good enough, but
think it's going to be good enough, but
we need to have a long enough segment if
we need to have a long enough segment if
you put this too small. Yeah. Right.
you put this too small. Yeah. Right.
I agree.
Because one of the things you said to me
Because one of the things you said to me
last time was also that uh uh you need
last time was also that uh uh you need
to do something trajectory wise,
to do something trajectory wise,
otherwise it's not meaningful enough. Um
otherwise it's not meaningful enough. Um
And so the only way to
And so the only way to
you know I thought about what you said
you know I thought about what you said
that we couldn't interfere through the
that we couldn't interfere through the
states and so I think most of those
states and so I think most of those
papers just uh work around this by um
papers just uh work around this by um
building an intrinsic reward right it's
building an intrinsic reward right it's
just
just
because you can't do that then you have
because you can't do that then you have
to force it some somehow
to force it some somehow
uh and that's what they do most of them
uh and that's what they do most of them
what is this doing.
Uh, which one is it?
Uh, which one is it?
Also, this
Also, this
actions on cybernetic.
Yeah. So, those one Okay. Yeah. So those
Yeah. So, those one Okay. Yeah. So those
ones are basically to my understanding
ones are basically to my understanding
they basically added an exploration term
they basically added an exploration term
to the skill discovery uh reward.
[Music]
[Music]
probably like the best known products.
Am I missing something or is this one
Am I missing something or is this one
pretty easy? Oh, this an LSD.
Yeah, I think they're uh very very
Yeah, I think they're uh very very
similar.
Just add an encoder somewhere, right?
Just add an encoder somewhere, right?
Add like an extra little encoder and
Add like an extra little encoder and
then you just do this in the train step,
then you just do this in the train step,
right?
right?
In the train step, you have to do this
In the train step, you have to do this
extra loss thing. Yeah, pretty much it.
extra loss thing. Yeah, pretty much it.
This a reward or is this uh
This a reward or is this uh
differentiable? Hang on.
in LSD or you're in Metra, right? Yeah,
in LSD or you're in Metra, right? Yeah,
Metra.
Metra.
Is this a reward or is this
Is this a reward or is this
differentiated through?
I don't want the AI to summarize
I don't want the AI to summarize
wrong.
Yeah, to me it's a reward.
Yeah, to me it's a reward.
You think this is a reward?
Let me see if I can find
Let me see if I can find
How do they train this component?
minimum. What's this temporal distance?
minimum. What's this temporal distance?
Hang on.
I mean to me this is a reward the policy
I mean to me this is a reward the policy
but then the discriminator is uh trying
but then the discriminator is uh trying
everything is differentiable. So for
everything is differentiable. So for
this one is it's it's trained through
this one is it's it's trained through
grad and descent.
Okay. So you have to you just compute
Okay. So you have to you just compute
this thing then in the train loop. I
this thing then in the train loop. I
think
think
uh you it in the train loop before you
uh you it in the train loop before you
like
like
have you have to compute this thing in
have you have to compute this thing in
the train loop to add to the reward
the train loop to add to the reward
before you do advantage.
before you do advantage.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah.
Yeah.

though.
I' I've been doing deep learning since I
I' I've been doing deep learning since I
was like 16. This is uh I mean this is
was like 16. This is uh I mean this is
like obviously not an area that I spend
like obviously not an area that I spend
a lot of time in this thing. If you are
a lot of time in this thing. If you are
new,
most of the stuff around here is RL, but

check the X. Same as the uh Twitch
check the X. Same as the uh Twitch

have guides for general ML and for RL.
To me, the way we would implement those
To me, the way we would implement those
is very very similar to the way you
is very very similar to the way you

would implement.
I think so, isn't it? Like they're all
I think so, isn't it? Like they're all
kind of pretty similar.
kind of pretty similar.
Yes.
Yes.
I would just branch three hack it and
I would just branch three hack it and
like the thing is I think if I'm not
like the thing is I think if I'm not
wrong here and I'm exhausted like I've
wrong here and I'm exhausted like I've
been like it's been a long week but I'm
been like it's been a long week but I'm
pretty damn sure that if you just
pretty damn sure that if you just
if you just set t to one you get LSD.
if you just set t to one you get LSD.

Dax is kind of a freaking mess though. I

it's on you to figure it out.
Yes. So you basically think that those

are interesting

I don't know if they is defined

if five is defined the same. They

through so many of them. But uh
through so many of them. But uh
oh, they actually have a blog post as
oh, they actually have a blog post as
well.
The big issue I have with all all of
The big issue I have with all all of
those ones is that they train first in
those ones is that they train first in
the unsupervised way and then they go
the unsupervised way and then they go
down for downstream tasks. Uh I don't
down for downstream tasks. Uh I don't
think that's something that is efficient
think that's something that is efficient
enough.

Just mix the objectives.
Just mix the objectives.
Yeah. So you would basically mix the
Yeah. So you would basically mix the
rewards, right? So you would probably

have like the And I I guess my intuition
have like the And I I guess my intuition
says that you would start to have most
says that you would start to have most
weight to the interesting rewards first

Um, we basically have a thing where we

can steer atoms around, have them be

actually realistic. So, that's next. And
actually realistic. So, that's next. And
what we're going to do is do stuff like

Okay. Yeah. Um so if you agree with me,
Okay. Yeah. Um so if you agree with me,
I think the idea was that, you know, we
I think the idea was that, you know, we
go through a couple of papers. If you
go through a couple of papers. If you
think they're interesting enough, then I

just uh uh I put some time in and try to
just uh uh I put some time in and try to
implement them with buffer.

I would like it if they had if all these

No, I think uh the most common ground is

I see not CSD.

Yeah. So, like they all have baselines.
Yeah. So, like they all have baselines.
The only thing that's a little sketch is
The only thing that's a little sketch is
like some of them do they both have bad
like some of them do they both have bad
l? This one is the only one that has bad
l? This one is the only one that has bad
base.

Yeah. So, this one has a bad base. Like
Yeah. So, this one has a bad base. Like
this one says that this is not that well
this one says that this is not that well
not even actually no it has it better
not even actually no it has it better
than Diane. So still fine. This says
than Diane. So still fine. This says
that it's like a good chunk better than
that it's like a good chunk better than
Diane or else. And then this one says
Diane or else. And then this one says
hang on.
It went by train cur. Well,
It went by train cur. Well,
yeah. The the biggest sketchy thing I
yeah. The the biggest sketchy thing I
found across all of them is that they uh
found across all of them is that they uh
really focus on state exploration, which
really focus on state exploration, which
is great, but there's very little uh
is great, but there's very little uh
done about actual rewards and downstream
done about actual rewards and downstream
tasks.

Why didn't you join an AI lab?
Uh because everybody's doing the same
Uh because everybody's doing the same
bloody thing, Ronaldo. Everybody's just
bloody thing, Ronaldo. Everybody's just
doing LLMs. like they put 99% of the
doing LLMs. like they put 99% of the
focus into one area. They're like
focus into one area. They're like
completely missing out all this other
completely missing out all this other
stuff in RL. Like they're just obvious

Just nobody's doing it. Oh, I am doing
Just nobody's doing it. Oh, I am doing
it.
Actually, this is kind of a closer
Actually, this is kind of a closer
comparison, right?

This would be worth looking at because
This would be worth looking at because
these these claim to have very similar
these these claim to have very similar

results, right?
Results. This one the results kind of
Results. This one the results kind of
suck on, don't they?
suck on, don't they?
This one has
This one has
Well, I don't actually know if this one
Well, I don't actually know if this one
sucks. At the very least they don't show
yeah they don't behaviors they only show
yeah they don't behaviors they only show
that one I was a bit a bit suspicious
that one I was a bit a bit suspicious
because the result they show on uh so
because the result they show on uh so
they benchmark against and uh it's uh
they benchmark against and uh it's uh
the results seemed a bit lower than on
the results seemed a bit lower than on
the original so
the original so
let's say if we go through these these
let's say if we go through these these
two seem to show similar results right
two seem to show similar results right
like look this is the same task
like look this is the same task
this
this
this All right.
This
This
humanoid
does actually claim better results I
does actually claim better results I
think. I don't know. Pixels.
Okay. So, we actually do have to look at
Okay. So, we actually do have to look at
the difference between these two because
the difference between these two because
I think they're claiming quite similar
I think they're claiming quite similar
results.
I think generally the other the Metro

Good point.

That's sketchy as hell.
Maybe there was a review or something.

Um
Um
yeah. So the first like authors are
yeah. So the first like authors are
always the
always the
Okay. So then you're
Okay. So then you're
Yes. Then you're very right. Okay. So
Yes. Then you're very right. Okay. So
the the first um the first version of
the the first um the first version of
Metra was in 2023 and the first version
Metra was in 2023 and the first version
of CSD was in the same year. So
of CSD was in the same year. So
um
actually Metro is like a okay a couple
actually Metro is like a okay a couple
of months older than CST. So it still
of months older than CST. So it still
raises the question.
raises the question.
Yeah. If you look at the first versions,
Yeah. If you look at the first versions,
uh the last versions of Metro is 2024,
uh the last versions of Metro is 2024,
but the first one was do they do
but the first one was do they do
different
different
at the same time
at the same time
topic

and not compare to himself.
I guess where's the algorithm?
I
I
mean they site in Metra they site CSD.
mean they site in Metra they site CSD.
So
So
okay
okay
that's weird right?
Is this am I wrong or is
Trying to see how this is actually
Trying to see how this is actually
computed.
I mean to me it's very similar, right?
I mean to me it's very similar, right?
Yeah. Hang on. Cuz it's a it's a state
Yeah. Hang on. Cuz it's a it's a state
based as well.
Well, you're looking at
Well, you're looking at
X and Y. Now you're looking at DSD,
X and Y. Now you're looking at DSD,
right?
right?
Oh, wait.
Yeah, sorry. The stream is
Yeah, sorry. The stream is
still here. It's still
still here. It's still
They don't show the computation. This
What's this inverse?
What's this inverse matrix?
Sorry, I lost the strangers. I can't
Sorry, I lost the strangers. I can't
really see.
really see.
It's okay. Hang on.
Yeah, you have it on page five
Yeah, you have it on page five
or the code. Sorry.
Which paper is this? We're looking
Which paper is this? We're looking
through a bunch of SE parks. Um like

Okay. So this like basically it looks
Okay. So this like basically it looks
like like all this code he's been
like like all this code he's been
building up on this ford.
building up on this ford.
Um,
Okay. So, actually these are both
Okay. So, actually these are both
follow-ups to um LSD. He did two
follow-ups to um LSD. He did two
separate follow-ups to pay.
I think we just need to understand the
I think we just need to understand the
uh the difference because he has two
uh the difference because he has two
very similar papers that are both
very similar papers that are both
follow-ups to him earlier paper

between CSC and Metro.
Yes.
I think it's likely you're going to end
I think it's likely you're going to end
up wanting to all of these
up wanting to all of these
and they're going to be very similar.
Yeah, if you're okay with that, I think
Yeah, if you're okay with that, I think
it's probably also going to be better
it's probably also going to be better
for you in terms of uh time. Uh like I
for you in terms of uh time. Uh like I
might start implementing the LST and
might start implementing the LST and
then move on, try implementing.
then move on, try implementing.
There's one thing I noticed.
There's one thing I noticed.
Uhhuh. You're going to want to just
check the code for locomotion
says right here theation of LSD in here
says right here theation of LSD in here
is
is
much better.
So if you're going to like the this is
So if you're going to like the this is
the thing to start with I'd use this
the thing to start with I'd use this
one. This is like He basically tweaked
one. This is like He basically tweaked
his original and then added some new
his original and then added some new
stuff, right? Added like this these
stuff, right? Added like this these
changes and now it's the new algorithm.
changes and now it's the new algorithm.
So the it's the combination of these
So the it's the combination of these
improvements
improvements
plus the algorithmic uh changes. I would
plus the algorithmic uh changes. I would
look here
look here
like right here.
Um, yeah, your stream dropped again.
Um, yeah, your stream dropped again.

Not sure if it I don't think it's me
Not sure if it I don't think it's me
because I still hear you on Discord, but

I haven't dropped any frames
before.

Okay. Well, I think that this is most
Okay. Well, I think that this is most
likely
most likely the play. Now,
most likely the play. Now,
pretty much all of these have some sort
pretty much all of these have some sort
of state difference of encoders, right?
of state difference of encoders, right?
Like encoder state difference thing. Um,
Like encoder state difference thing. Um,
what you're going to want to do is
there's a Diane branch. Okay. It's kind
there's a Diane branch. Okay. It's kind
of old, but you can see it.
of old, but you can see it.
Yeah, I looked at it. uh couple of weeks
Yeah, I looked at it. uh couple of weeks
ago.
ago.
It has like the
paparella in here. Oh,
paparella in here. Oh,
it was the old one. So, it's still demo.
it was the old one. So, it's still demo.
I think you still had the demo fight,
I think you still had the demo fight,
right?
right?
Yeah. Where's up?
Okay. So, this is
Okay. So, this is
Yeah, I have all like the Diane stuff in
Yeah, I have all like the Diane stuff in
here. If you look,
here. If you look,
I think the main thing is
Yeah. So the main thing with Diane is
Yeah. So the main thing with Diane is
like the sampling from the like the
like the sampling from the like the
sampling of the indices
computation of the loss.
I think you have to
I think you have to
I think you have to do it in this train
I think you have to do it in this train
function though. I think you have to
function though. I think you have to
recomputee it back the advantage.
But yeah, this is this is what I would
But yeah, this is this is what I would
start with. I'd start with probably like

the of them. You're going to want an
the of them. You're going to want an
environment, by the way, that's just

You might even just have like might even

Oh okay who also is thousand.
Oh let's see
Oh let's see
I think if one of those papers like

Yep.
Yep.
Like built off the same code base. I
