Um, the goal is to just focus
Um, the goal is to just focus
for a few
hours and just really hammer out the

rest of these environment fixes.

Um, I bet I want to hammer out the rest
Um, I bet I want to hammer out the rest
of these environment fixes. I want
of these environment fixes. I want
to probably set up containers, fix some
to probably set up containers, fix some
experiments, and then just start running
experiments, and then just start running
some
some
stuff over to here.
So, if I
recall, we did kind of have mobile
recall, we did kind of have mobile
working. I got this working last
night. It's fine.
But I think I messed up tower climb.
Oh, well, this is just not running the
Oh, well, this is just not running the
uh the correct code at all, huh?
probably want like the grid
[Music]
[Music]
code. Maybe neural MMO
code. Maybe neural MMO
3. Now, this doesn't have a shared

either.
Maybe
this. Maybe we do
this
this
maps. Oh, you know what? This can
maps. Oh, you know what? This can
actually get veinated, can't it?
But we actually can
do just a simple veinet like
this. Then we can
do this just needs numb maps.
We got no
We got no
maps. All these rewards
state something like this, you know.
Okay. So, seg
Okay. So, seg
fault we have uh we have prepared for
fault we have uh we have prepared for
this
This is what we
This is what we
want. And
Okay, maybe we get a full stack
trace. Probably something in the binding
trace. Probably something in the binding
file, right?
Hey YouTube
Hey YouTube
folks, we're going to finish here. The
folks, we're going to finish here. The
um so apparently I I forgot I did this,
um so apparently I I forgot I did this,
but last night I must have just fixed
but last night I must have just fixed
MOA. Um tower climb I have a couple
MOA. Um tower climb I have a couple
things remaining to fix on and then we
things remaining to fix on and then we
will probably do all the
will probably do all the
containerization work today. Uh, that's
containerization work today. Uh, that's
probably something I can I can mostly
probably something I can I can mostly
get
get
done. That actually means that once I
done. That actually means that once I
ship those, you all will be able to test
ship those, you all will be able to test
all this stuff out super easily. So, if
all this stuff out super easily. So, if
anybody wants to come help test release,
anybody wants to come help test release,
helps us out a bunch. Kind of just use
helps us out a bunch. Kind of just use
it, play with it, see what things work
it, play with it, see what things work
and what things don't, and like tell us
and what things don't, and like tell us
what's
broken. Okay, we do get a stack trace.
Yeah. So, this is uh I just did this
Yeah. So, this is uh I just did this
like dict unpacking
like dict unpacking
wrong. So, this is the thing from
yesterday. Let's do this.
And it should be almost the same. So we
And it should be almost the same. So we
want Hang on. So this one we want

need puzzles. Levels and puzzles, I
need puzzles. Levels and puzzles, I

I'm get Yes.
Okay. So, we get
this
this
Anyway, is this level's

handle? No, this is
OB. This is not your first time in the
OB. This is not your first time in the
chat and you've asked the same damn
chat and you've asked the same damn
thing
before. If you ask
before. If you ask
nicely, maybe you'll get a couple bench
nicely, maybe you'll get a couple bench
sets. Anything else is extra.
Yes, you damn well
have. Is there a freaking I don't even
have. Is there a freaking I don't even
think I have the tool for this. I know
think I have the tool for this. I know
in Twitch you can literally just click
in Twitch you can literally just click

Nah, screw that. But thanks for
Nah, screw that. But thanks for
reminding me. I do need to bench
Resting strength is pretty well back
now. Yeah, but you got to pay extra for
[Music]
that. Hey, Captain. How's it going?
Look, I mean, at least these type of
Look, I mean, at least these type of
trolls are funny,
right? Hey, Captain. What's uh let's say
right? Hey, Captain. What's uh let's say
we get a a binding for Impulse Wars,
we get a a binding for Impulse Wars,
huh? We have This is right here. The
huh? We have This is right here. The
last Syon end I've done. I mean, well,
last Syon end I've done. I mean, well,
between bet helping and me, all 20 M's
between bet helping and me, all 20 M's
are going to have new API bindings
are going to have new API bindings
today.
Yeah, we definitely want

um clean impulse wars. Does that help
um clean impulse wars. Does that help
with any of the build stuff by the way

But yeah, sometimes we do just have to

do a bunch of boring ass
work. I don't have a sub button there
work. I don't have a sub button there
either, man. This is just this is live
either, man. This is just this is live
research being done.
Like around here we
Like around here we
train we train agents to play games and
train we train agents to play games and
we train me to be

jacked. That's what we do. It's training
all day all the time.
If I get binding and build work without

to be useful for like training and

nice to chuck on the website, for sure.
nice to chuck on the website, for sure.
Um, I'm more concerned though about
Um, I'm more concerned though about
getting the thing not in a damn sub
getting the thing not in a damn sub
package and like actually into our
package and like actually into our
experiment flow, so like we can have
experiment flow, so like we can have
proper sweeps and get proper models,
proper sweeps and get proper models,
right?
Wait, why are
Wait, why are
you why are you advertising contracts to

Whatever this was, this is the code that

I needed to base this off

Okay. And then this one is I forgot
Okay. And then this one is I forgot
this. I just forgot a
line. Is it levels and
line. Is it levels and
puzzles? Yeah, it's levels and
puzzles? Yeah, it's levels and
puzzles. All right. So, this is puzzles.
puzzles. Try this.
Is it stuck or just taking a
while? Probably just taking a while to

build puzzles, right?
Take debug
off. Force rebuild as well.
What does shared method do in bindings?
What does shared method do in bindings?
It's if you need to init some objects
It's if you need to init some objects
that are shared across all ends. I don't
that are shared across all ends. I don't
think you have any
think you have any
um like all your data is small enough
um like all your data is small enough
that it doesn't matter if you have it on
that it doesn't matter if you have it on
every single end. But like for mobile
every single end. But like for mobile
for instance, the map the pathing data
for instance, the map the pathing data
is 256 megs. So that has to be shared
is 256 megs. So that has to be shared
across all the
across all the
instances. I will check out the Q flush
instances. I will check out the Q flush
thing as soon as I fix tower climb
bet. Patching
bet. Patching
data. Well, it is and it isn't. It's
data. Well, it is and it isn't. It's
annoying because right now like I
annoying because right now like I
haven't come up with a way to simplify
haven't come up with a way to simplify
the Python API at all. So like the pack
the Python API at all. So like the pack
unpack statements are really obnoxious
unpack statements are really obnoxious
because the Python API just has a ton of
because the Python API just has a ton of
annoying error checks. But like it's
annoying error checks. But like it's
going to get better. This is basically
going to get better. This is basically
V1 of this pure C
API. Okay. So this is
um I don't know. This looks like roughly
um I don't know. This looks like roughly
correct. So I think we're good here.
Yeah, this is fine. It's like unstable,
Yeah, this is fine. It's like unstable,
but we haven't swept it at all.
You going to be streaming for a while?
Yeah. No, I don't eat lunch.
Yes and no. I'm like my head's like
Yes and no. I'm like my head's like
super fuzzy to be
super fuzzy to be
honest. This like binding work it just
honest. This like binding work it just
like I get bored and like I just can't
like I get bored and like I just can't
focus. Let me see. Make sure I actually
focus. Let me see. Make sure I actually
committed all the files.
I don't know how I forgot
this. Wait. Huh?
this. Wait. Huh?
Unttracked files.
No, it's
No, it's
fine. I mean, you're not obligated to do
fine. I mean, you're not obligated to do
them, but I got them now. It's just It's
them, but I got them now. It's just It's
not just bindings. That's like only a
not just bindings. That's like only a
day of boring stuff, which is totally
day of boring stuff, which is totally
fine. It's just that released is like
fine. It's just that released is like
three or four consecutive weeks of
three or four consecutive weeks of
boring stuff, and it's just

Um just from what we have now cleanly

packaged

up. So it's actually like scientifically
up. So it's actually like scientifically
it's pretty revolutionary contribution.
it's pretty revolutionary contribution.
Pretty nice.
Pretty nice.
Right. So, that is all the M's done.
Right. So, that is all the M's done.
Um, I guess we can maybe do container
Um, I guess we can maybe do container
stuff for a bit. I definitely don't have
stuff for a bit. I definitely don't have
docs in me right now to write
docs in me right now to write
docs, but I think we can probably do
docs, but I think we can probably do
containerization stuff.
Hell is
this. We're at the cool story, bro, of
this. We're at the cool story, bro, of
people spamming my
Discord.
Discord.
Mhm. No, I'm thinking in the background
Mhm. No, I'm thinking in the background
here. So, what I've basically been
here. So, what I've basically been
trying to figure out in the background
trying to figure out in the background
while I've been like doing stuff. So,
while I've been like doing stuff. So,
right now here, let me explain. We have
right now here, let me explain. We have
base.doccker file. This thing is tiny
base.doccker file. This thing is tiny
and
and
like do we really
need to have like three different build
need to have like three different build
stages, you know?
Can't I just like stick everything in
Can't I just like stick everything in
one damn Docker file and call it a
day? I think I can,
right? Cuz
right? Cuz
like this stuff can get cleaned up.
And like the thing is if anything is
And like the thing is if anything is
going to be different, right? If we're
going to be different, right? If we're
going to have like different containers,
going to have like different containers,
the most likely difference is going to
the most likely difference is going to
be the uh the
base. So like what's the point, right?
Yeah, the way the Docker build is set
Yeah, the way the Docker build is set
up, the multi-stage thing only really
up, the multi-stage thing only really
helps if you have the same base and then
helps if you have the same base and then
different containers on top of that. But
different containers on top of that. But
that's kind of unlikely for us, right?
We can always go back to having the
We can always go back to having the
base. But yeah, I think for now we're
base. But yeah, I think for now we're
going to just paste all the files
going to just paste all the files
together and see what happens because
together and see what happens because
that's what I usually like to do. And
that's what I usually like to do. And
I'll be right back. Let me use a
I'll be right back. Let me use a
restroom and uh grab a drink and we will
restroom and uh grab a drink and we will
hack on this.
Okay.
This is dev
branch. So I do have to upgrade drivers
branch. So I do have to upgrade drivers
on the host
on the host
here if I want CUDA 128.
want this pie torch
on. See what they're on.
Okay. So, they've got 126
driver version.
It's not fine is the
It's not fine is the
thing driver. This is
thing driver. This is
560. Oh, it's just 6 for this. Yeah.
Okay. Well, what's wrong is whether it's
Okay. Well, what's wrong is whether it's
in it's not in the Abuntu package repos,
in it's not in the Abuntu package repos,
I think.
I think.
So, like I can do it,
So, like I can do it,
but you have to upgrade your
but you have to upgrade your
drivers. Maybe that's fine. Maybe we
drivers. Maybe that's fine. Maybe we
just give you an upgrade script.
Yeah, I am going to have to reboot the
Yeah, I am going to have to reboot the
stream when I do this and hope I don't
stream when I do this and hope I don't
break my system.
But let's just assume that we do
128 and like can I just comment? Here's
128 and like can I just comment? Here's
what we're going to do. We're going to
what we're going to do. We're going to
comment literally everything in here and
comment literally everything in here and
then we're going to do like staged
then we're going to do like staged
builds.
And we're going to test like one at a
And we're going to test like one at a
time, which I guess technically is what
time, which I guess technically is what
the other dockers were for, but this is
the other dockers were for, but this is
just as like this is just fine as Well,
Happy

then you 128.

Let me not delete my container by

When is Puffer Lib keynote
happening? Well, we are going to do a
happening? Well, we are going to do a
bunch of releases for 3L. So, we'll have
bunch of releases for 3L. So, we'll have
all the blog posts come out. I mean, the
all the blog posts come out. I mean, the
thing is like because all of our dev is
thing is like because all of our dev is
public, if you watch the stream, there's
public, if you watch the stream, there's
not going to be much surprising, but
not going to be much surprising, but
it'll still be cool to see how people
it'll still be cool to see how people
react to all the new things where I
react to all the new things where I
mean, we've kind of been quietly
mean, we've kind of been quietly
building soda reinforcement learning
building soda reinforcement learning
stuff for the last few months. And all I
stuff for the last few months. And all I
have to do is package it up and it's
have to do is package it up and it's
ready to
ready to
go. The packaging it up takes a
go. The packaging it up takes a
while. Let's go figure out how to update
while. Let's go figure out how to update
our drivers in the meantime.
Yeah. So, this this doesn't work here.
Where's the darn
PPA? It's literally just
PPA? It's literally just
uh Yeah, this
failed to
failed to
solve. Well, let's do this.
What is the uh the bash
line? Oh, it just plus X. Okay.
Okay, we do
Okay, we do
get 570 server
get 570 server
open.
open.
Um, video driver 570 open.
What is wrong with
This
wait am I on a bunt to I'm on
wait am I on a bunt to I'm on
22 or am I on
24? No, I'm on 24.
24? No, I'm on 24.
So, what the heck is wrong with this?
If where this is breaking my system live
If where this is breaking my system live
on stream, then I will be back once it
on stream, then I will be back once it
is
is
fixed. We shall see.
Okay.
So, goal is we do we ship Abuntu
So, goal is we do we ship Abuntu
22.04 which is the last Abuntu version
22.04 which is the last Abuntu version
that doesn't have annoying driver
that doesn't have annoying driver

um
with 20 uh or with 570 driver
with 20 uh or with 570 driver
compatibility for CUDA 128, which gives
compatibility for CUDA 128, which gives
you 50 series card compatibility. Okay.
Yeah. So, it's a little more complicated
Yeah. So, it's a little more complicated
than that because on a 50 series card,
than that because on a 50 series card,
if you install 570 like this, if you
if you install 570 like this, if you
install this package, which it says is
install this package, which it says is

brick your machine
brick your machine
immediately. If you install the open

one, it works.
I probably should just make a script
I probably should just make a script
that does um you know sets up your host
that does um you know sets up your host

like we don't need to give you tail
like we don't need to give you tail

Yeah.
Yeah.
Heat. Come

I'm just trying to make like a basic
I'm just trying to make like a basic

we get a a binding for Impulse Wars,

between bet helping and me, all 20 M's
between bet helping and me, all 20 M's
are going to have new API bindings

today.
Yeah, we definitely want

Like around here we

we train me to be

If I get binding and build work without

to be useful for like training and

Um, I'm more concerned though about
Um, I'm more concerned though about
getting the thing not in a damn sub
getting the thing not in a damn sub

Wait, why are

Okay. And then this one is I forgot

Is it stuck or just taking a

Take debug

What does shared method do in bindings?

It's if you need to init some objects

for instance, the map the pathing data
for instance, the map the pathing data
is 256 megs. So that has to be shared

across all the

annoying because right now like I
annoying because right now like I
haven't come up with a way to simplify
haven't come up with a way to simplify
the Python API at all. So like the pack
the Python API at all. So like the pack
unpack statements are really obnoxious
unpack statements are really obnoxious
because the Python API just has a ton of
because the Python API just has a ton of
annoying error checks. But like it's
annoying error checks. But like it's
going to get better. This is basically
going to get better. This is basically
V1 of this pure C
API. Okay. So this is
um I don't know. This looks like roughly
um I don't know. This looks like roughly
correct. So I think we're good here.
Yeah, this is fine. It's like unstable,
Yeah, this is fine. It's like unstable,
but we haven't swept it at all.
You going to be streaming for a while?
Yeah. No, I don't eat lunch.
Yes and no. I'm like my head's like
Yes and no. I'm like my head's like
super fuzzy to be
super fuzzy to be
honest. This like binding work it just
honest. This like binding work it just
like I get bored and like I just can't
like I get bored and like I just can't
focus. Let me see. Make sure I actually
focus. Let me see. Make sure I actually
committed all the files.
I don't know how I forgot
this. Wait. Huh?
this. Wait. Huh?
Unttracked files.
No, it's
No, it's
fine. I mean, you're not obligated to do
fine. I mean, you're not obligated to do
them, but I got them now. It's just It's
them, but I got them now. It's just It's
not just bindings. That's like only a
not just bindings. That's like only a
day of boring stuff, which is totally

fine. It's just that released is like
fine. It's just that released is like
three or four consecutive weeks of

Um just from what we have now cleanly

packaged
packaged
up. So it's actually like scientifically
up. So it's actually like scientifically
it's pretty revolutionary contribution.
it's pretty revolutionary contribution.
Pretty nice.
Pretty nice.
Right. So, that is all the M's done.
Right. So, that is all the M's done.
Um, I guess we can maybe do container
Um, I guess we can maybe do container
stuff for a bit. I definitely don't have
stuff for a bit. I definitely don't have
docs in me right now to write
docs in me right now to write
docs, but I think we can probably do
docs, but I think we can probably do
containerization stuff.
Hell is
this. We're at the cool story, bro, of
this. We're at the cool story, bro, of
people spamming my
Discord.
Discord.
Mhm. No, I'm thinking in the background
Mhm. No, I'm thinking in the background
here. So, what I've basically been
here. So, what I've basically been
trying to figure out in the background
trying to figure out in the background
while I've been like doing stuff. So,
while I've been like doing stuff. So,
right now here, let me explain. We have
right now here, let me explain. We have
base.doccker file. This thing is tiny
base.doccker file. This thing is tiny
and
and
like do we really
need to have like three different build
need to have like three different build
stages, you know?
Can't I just like stick everything in
Can't I just like stick everything in
one damn Docker file and call it a
day? I think I can,
right? Cuz
right? Cuz
like this stuff can get cleaned up.
And like the thing is if anything is
And like the thing is if anything is
going to be different, right? If we're
going to be different, right? If we're
going to have like different containers,
going to have like different containers,
the most likely difference is going to
the most likely difference is going to
be the uh the
base. So like what's the point, right?
Yeah, the way the Docker build is set
Yeah, the way the Docker build is set
up, the multi-stage thing only really
up, the multi-stage thing only really
helps if you have the same base and then
helps if you have the same base and then
different containers on top of that. But
different containers on top of that. But
that's kind of unlikely for us, right?
We can always go back to having the
We can always go back to having the
base. But yeah, I think for now we're
base. But yeah, I think for now we're
going to just paste all the files
going to just paste all the files
together and see what happens because
together and see what happens because
that's what I usually like to do. And
that's what I usually like to do. And
I'll be right back. Let me use a
I'll be right back. Let me use a
restroom and uh grab a drink and we will
restroom and uh grab a drink and we will
hack on this.
Okay.
This is dev
branch. So I do have to upgrade drivers
branch. So I do have to upgrade drivers
on the host
on the host
here if I want CUDA 128.
want this pie torch
on. See what they're on.
Okay. So, they've got 126
driver version.
It's not fine is the
It's not fine is the
thing driver. This is
thing driver. This is
560. Oh, it's just 6 for this. Yeah.
Okay. Well, what's wrong is whether it's
Okay. Well, what's wrong is whether it's
in it's not in the Abuntu package repos,
in it's not in the Abuntu package repos,
I think.
I think.
So, like I can do it,
So, like I can do it,
but you have to upgrade your
but you have to upgrade your
drivers. Maybe that's fine. Maybe we
drivers. Maybe that's fine. Maybe we
just give you an upgrade script.
Yeah, I am going to have to reboot the
Yeah, I am going to have to reboot the
stream when I do this and hope I don't
stream when I do this and hope I don't
break my system.
But let's just assume that we do
128 and like can I just comment? Here's
128 and like can I just comment? Here's
what we're going to do. We're going to
what we're going to do. We're going to
comment literally everything in here and
comment literally everything in here and
then we're going to do like staged
then we're going to do like staged
builds.
And we're going to test like one at a
And we're going to test like one at a
time, which I guess technically is what
time, which I guess technically is what
the other dockers were for, but this is
the other dockers were for, but this is
just as like this is just fine as Well,
Happy
Tuesday. Okay, so we'll do
128 and
then you 128.
So, like
So, like
this Google IO keynote. I don't I
this Google IO keynote. I don't I
honestly I don't go to any of the like
honestly I don't go to any of the like
the big tech
keynotes. Like if something important
keynotes. Like if something important
happens, I'll hear about it on X.
happens, I'll hear about it on X.
Otherwise, it probably didn't matter.
Do you need
um You do need all this,
right? Yes. Misk.
What is
this? This do
anything? Okay, so you only really need
anything? Okay, so you only really need
this at the very end.
Let me not delete my container by
Let me not delete my container by
mistake.
When is Puffer Lib keynote
happening? Well, we are going to do a
happening? Well, we are going to do a
bunch of releases for 3L. So, we'll have
bunch of releases for 3L. So, we'll have
all the blog posts come out. I mean, the
all the blog posts come out. I mean, the
thing is like because all of our dev is
thing is like because all of our dev is
public, if you watch the stream, there's
public, if you watch the stream, there's
not going to be much surprising, but
not going to be much surprising, but
it'll still be cool to see how people
it'll still be cool to see how people
react to all the new things where I
react to all the new things where I
mean, we've kind of been quietly
mean, we've kind of been quietly
building soda reinforcement learning
building soda reinforcement learning
stuff for the last few months. And all I
stuff for the last few months. And all I
have to do is package it up and it's
have to do is package it up and it's
ready to
ready to
go. The packaging it up takes a
go. The packaging it up takes a
while. Let's go figure out how to update
while. Let's go figure out how to update
our drivers in the meantime.
Yeah. So, this this doesn't work here.
Where's the darn
PPA? It's literally just
PPA? It's literally just
uh Yeah, this
failed to
failed to
solve. Well, let's do this.
What is the uh the bash
line? Oh, it just plus X. Okay.
Okay, we do
Okay, we do
get 570 server
get 570 server
open.
open.
Um, video driver 570 open.
What is wrong with
This
wait am I on a bunt to I'm on
wait am I on a bunt to I'm on
22 or am I on
24? No, I'm on 24.
24? No, I'm on 24.
So, what the heck is wrong with this?
If where this is breaking my system live
If where this is breaking my system live
on stream, then I will be back once it
on stream, then I will be back once it
is
is
fixed. We shall see.
Okay.
So, goal is we do we ship Abuntu
So, goal is we do we ship Abuntu
22.04 which is the last Abuntu version
22.04 which is the last Abuntu version
that doesn't have annoying driver
that doesn't have annoying driver

with 20 uh or with 570 driver
compatibility for CUDA 128, which gives
compatibility for CUDA 128, which gives
you 50 series card compatibility. Okay.
Yeah. So, it's a little more complicated
Yeah. So, it's a little more complicated
than that because on a 50 series card,
than that because on a 50 series card,
if you install 570 like this, if you
if you install 570 like this, if you
install this package, which it says is
install this package, which it says is
compatible on the Nvidia website, you

immediately. If you install the open
immediately. If you install the open
one, it works.
I probably should just make a script
I probably should just make a script
that does um you know sets up your host
that does um you know sets up your host
machine, right?
like we don't need to give you tail
like we don't need to give you tail
scale and
stuff but like
stuff but like
docker and I could just give you your
docker and I could just give you your
docker install
container.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Heat. Come
on.
I'm just trying to make like a basic
I'm just trying to make like a basic
setup script. So like we have our whole
setup script. So like we have our whole
setup script for um puffer
boxes, but uh I'm going to add one
boxes, but uh I'm going to add one
that's for
that's for
users. We just do a little bit of uh
users. We just do a little bit of uh
tooling dev today.
Okay. So, this is where I have to uh I
Okay. So, this is where I have to uh I
probably do have to reboot things. So I
probably do have to reboot things. So I
will be
