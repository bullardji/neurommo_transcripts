Reream just drops. I have no idea why.
Well, let's keep going on this for a

I might just get like I'm only here for
I might just get like I'm only here for
a week, but probably the next time I'm
a week, but probably the next time I'm
here I'll just get like Starlink or

I don't freaking know. Either like

it's weird that it happens even when I

Isn't this like a pretty sizable
Isn't this like a pretty sizable
drone? This should look bigger than
drone? This should look bigger than
this. No.
Okay. That's like tiny drone.
Okay. That's like tiny drone.
But like 75
you know it should be bigger than that.
you know it should be bigger than that.
7.75 radius is quite large.
Okay. So, they have the
sphere.
Oh, no. This is right.
This is r / 2.
Then this is plus r minus r.
That seems right to me, but it's not.
This thing should be substantially
This thing should be substantially
bigger
bigger
than this, I would think.
Well, maybe not.
Okay. But then the ring should be
ring radius should only be 2 * the arm
ring radius should only be 2 * the arm
length four *

this.
this.
Okay.
So now I should be able to do
Yeah. So that's a big drone, right?
So we're going to want to do
So we're going to want to do
Let's say the scale of things that we
Let's say the scale of things that we
want to look at is going to be
want to look at is going to be
everything from like
point
05 or something 5 cm
up to maybe
up to maybe
couple of feet initially.
So, nowhere near this big.
So, let's do like this. Let's see what
So, let's do like this. Let's see what
this does.
this does.
You're not going to be able to see this.
You're not going to be able to see this.
The thing it's like this little tiny
The thing it's like this little tiny
point down here.
Can you actually control this? I wonder.
Let's train this. And then afterwards
Let's train this. And then afterwards
what we'll do is we'll see if we can
what we'll do is we'll see if we can
randomize the size and learn over
randomize the size and learn over
different sizes. Yes.
Interesting. So, this does not
Interesting. So, this does not
does not work.
Let's see if we can make the rings
Let's see if we can make the rings
bigger.
Oops.
We can also randomize the target size.
Yeah, this is not training at all
Yeah, this is not training at all
though, which is a little odd. Okay,
though, which is a little odd. Okay,
let's go back to like what? 0.1
let's go back to like what? 0.1
or I think 0.2 was our original
Okay, this is annoying. It's um
We're actually still not learning.
These were mostly rendering changes,
These were mostly rendering changes,
weren't they?
It can fly around and not crash, but it
It can fly around and not crash, but it
can't figure out how to get in the
can't figure out how to get in the
ranks.
Okay. So, now it's actually doing
Okay. So, now it's actually doing
something.
It is having a tough time though.
It is having a tough time though.
Okay, so what did I break in the process
Okay, so what did I break in the process
of doing this?
Yeah, I totally broke something.
Yeah, you can see here it's not um
it's not
is the policy observing from first
is the policy observing from first
person or 3D person camera. Uh neither.
person or 3D person camera. Uh neither.
It's just getting it's relative state
It's just getting it's relative state
based estimate. So, when we throw this
based estimate. So, when we throw this
on real hardware, we're just going to
on real hardware, we're just going to
have to do some like really basic
have to do some like really basic
perception,
perception,
uh, not even end to end to just figure
uh, not even end to end to just figure
out where the rings are or like figure
out where the rings are or like figure
out where the target is.
You ideally don't really want to do end
You ideally don't really want to do end
to end camera. Uh, if you can avoid it
to end camera. Uh, if you can avoid it
for quite a while, you just make
for quite a while, you just make
everything between 100 and a thousand
everything between 100 and a thousand
times slower.
We can absolutely do stuff like um you
We can absolutely do stuff like um you
know put the ring like the ring position
know put the ring like the ring position
only if it's in the vision cone or
only if it's in the vision cone or
something. That's easy.
Okay. Okay. What did I mess up here?
The rings look smaller than before.
The rings look smaller than before.
Yeah, they're definitely smaller than
Yeah, they're definitely smaller than
before, right?
Yeah. So this is how it worked before.
Okay, now it trains.
Okay, now it trains.
It needs really big rings.
We were doing 0.1
before. No, we were doing 0.2 before.
before. No, we were doing 0.2 before.
So, we'll go 08.
So, we'll go 08.
So, times four in either direction, I
So, times four in either direction, I
suppose.
suppose.
And then we'll do like this.
And then we'll do like this.
We'll give it a small amount of uh
We'll give it a small amount of uh
domain randomization. Done.
Cool.
So, if we can get something sort of
So, if we can get something sort of
similar to this to train, then this is
similar to this to train, then this is
something I can show to Ben and uh Sam
something I can show to Ben and uh Sam
and we can check the formulas. Hey,
and we can check the formulas. Hey,
Kirthy. Yeah, I'm in uh Florida for a
Kirthy. Yeah, I'm in uh Florida for a
little bit and then I'll be in
little bit and then I'll be in
California thereafter. So, we're kind of
California thereafter. So, we're kind of
making do on a laptop setup for now. And
making do on a laptop setup for now. And
if the uh
if the uh
the internet is not amazing,
the internet is not amazing,
OBS likes to crash every so often,
OBS likes to crash every so often,
but we're making do
Okay. So, like this does train
Okay. So, like this does train
and it is fairly stable.
and it is fairly stable.
I don't know what the best you can get
I don't know what the best you can get
is out of this, but let's see what the
is out of this, but let's see what the
policy looks like that does this.
What are you cooking?
What are you cooking?
So, we've got we're trying to make the
So, we've got we're trying to make the
the same uh the same RL able to fly a
the same uh the same RL able to fly a
ton of different types of drones.
ton of different types of drones.
Now, they're hard to see because like
Now, they're hard to see because like
we're now working on really, really
we're now working on really, really
small ones,
but I'm trying to randomize like the
but I'm trying to randomize like the
physics, randomize the drone parameters
physics, randomize the drone parameters
and get it to be able to fly pretty much
and get it to be able to fly pretty much
any different drone.
So, this is a big drone right here.
So, this is a big drone right here.
You can see that the control is not
You can see that the control is not
exactly
exactly
reasonable. And that's not because of
reasonable. And that's not because of
the physics of this thing. It's just
the physics of this thing. It's just
because I've scaled everything wrong.
Yeah. So, the ones that like shoot
Yeah. So, the ones that like shoot
around like crazy are not going to be
around like crazy are not going to be
super learnable. Yeah.
All right. Let's see if we can figure
All right. Let's see if we can figure
out from the math
out from the math
what I've done wrong here. It's all
what I've done wrong here. It's all
here, right? So, it's just the scaling
here, right? So, it's just the scaling
is somehow screwy.
is somehow screwy.
Folks are uh you can feel free to tell
Folks are uh you can feel free to tell
me if I've screwed up physics if you
me if I've screwed up physics if you
know this type of stuff.
So the mass is going to scale
So the mass is going to scale
cubic with the size
cubic with the size
that seems fine
that seems fine
plus or - 10%.
Then you got the inertia scale
Then you got the inertia scale
which is mass time arm length time arm
which is mass time arm length time arm
length
length
that also can be plus or minus 10%.
that also can be plus or minus 10%.
Thrust
why is thrust proportional to mass?
why is thrust proportional to mass?
Okay. Thrust.
It's probably the RPM being scaled weird
It's probably the RPM being scaled weird
now.
We'll see how this uh trains by
We'll see how this uh trains by
comparison.
75 follows away from uh releasing the
75 follows away from uh releasing the
new RL guide.
I will have to make the images for that
I will have to make the images for that
later.
Okay, this did not help.
Okay, this did not help.
Presumably the drones are like falling
Presumably the drones are like falling
out of the sky or something. because
out of the sky or something. because
they're not able to keep themselves up.
Let's watch it a little bit. So, these
Let's watch it a little bit. So, these
are the tiny ones.
The tiny ones are kind of fine. They zip
The tiny ones are kind of fine. They zip
around.
around.
They've got quite a bit of um
I don't handle they don't handle super
I don't handle they don't handle super
well.
I don't know what that's trying to do.
Oh, wait. Did I mess up the uh Did I
Oh, wait. Did I mess up the uh Did I
mess up the the Z inertia?
I think I messed up the Z inertia,
I think I messed up the Z inertia,
didn't I?
Let's try this.
Oh, actually I don't know if it's Y or
Oh, actually I don't know if it's Y or
Z. Yeah, hang on.
Yep. Z. Okay.
So
if we fix that weird inertia scale
it does
This is worse than before by a lot,
This is worse than before by a lot,
isn't it? Well, I guess we'll see how it
isn't it? Well, I guess we'll see how it
converges.
So far, very bad.
Oh, because it's not proportional to
Oh, because it's not proportional to
mass. Hang on.
Okay. So, it does get to like 60ish%.
And then let's make this proportional to
And then let's make this proportional to
mass correctly.
And then after this what we can do
this put this into gro
up and computer's crash.
up and computer's crash.
Lovely.
Huh?
Huh?
Are we alive?
Are we alive?
I guess we're alive.
I got 16 gigs of uh

this should be fine.
How you liking Rock 4 so far?
Um,
Um,
it's like the same problem with all the
it's like the same problem with all the
models, right? It's slow.

It's like very slow.
It's like very slow.
So, I've mostly just still been using
So, I've mostly just still been using
Brock Great.
Yeah, it's really slow, right?
And like I asked something fairly basic
Mass distributed radially.
Okay.
Okay.
Scales L to the 5th. Fine. That was a
Scales L to the 5th. Fine. That was a
dumb thing to do anyways.
Oops.
Oops.
And there goes the computer again.
And there goes the computer again.
Yeah, it's completely locked up for some
Yeah, it's completely locked up for some
reason.
Am I out of memory or something? What
Am I out of memory or something? What
the hell?
the hell?
No, I'm not.
That's just Linux being Linux, I guess.
That's just Linux being Linux, I guess.
I have no idea. Just randomly locks up
I have no idea. Just randomly locks up
and sometimes it comes back, sometimes
and sometimes it comes back, sometimes
it doesn't.
This is just a This is just a bun. I'm
This is just a This is just a bun. I'm
not even doing anything weird.
You know what Isaac Lab is? Yeah.
We've done contract work in Isaac Jim,
We've done contract work in Isaac Jim,
even though that's old.
We wouldn't need Isaac Lab for something
We wouldn't need Isaac Lab for something
like this.
It's just going to be slower than what
It's just going to be slower than what
we're doing here and 10 times the amount
we're doing here and 10 times the amount
of code.
the rest of weight decreases
as one over L. Interesting.
as one over L. Interesting.
Would you recommend Isaac Lab for vision
Would you recommend Isaac Lab for vision
based RL?
No,
No,
not at all.
not at all.
Um,
like if I had to do vision for this, I
like if I had to do vision for this, I
would still keep the logic. I would keep
would still keep the logic. I would keep
the logic like I have it here and then I
the logic like I have it here and then I
would hook it up to the batch renderer
would hook it up to the batch renderer
of any of these engines, but I wouldn't
of any of these engines, but I wouldn't
use the engine itself. Like I think
use the engine itself. Like I think
Madrona has a decent more almost
Madrona has a decent more almost
standalone batch renderer. I'd probably
standalone batch renderer. I'd probably
just try to get like a standalone batch
just try to get like a standalone batch
renderer
renderer
if that makes sense.
Like all the main physics engines are
Like all the main physics engines are
just really bloated and slow
just really bloated and slow
and you have no idea what they're doing
and you have no idea what they're doing
half the time. They're just slow and
half the time. They're just slow and
like screw you if you want to figure out
like screw you if you want to figure out
why. This is just like layers and layers
why. This is just like layers and layers
and layers of stuff.
We do I over L.
We keep it as I
quadratic with the area.
scale is L²
max RPM decrease. recess.
I think that this is going to be
this is going to like not make it able
this is going to like not make it able
to fly, but we'll figure that out.
Okay, this is closer to the original
Okay, this is closer to the original
dynamics.
Now, if I
Now, if I
if I say that the drone is going to be
if I say that the drone is going to be
substantially bigger.
Yeah, that's not it.
I have no idea what that is, but that
I have no idea what that is, but that
ain't it.
mass scale is fine.
There's K drag and B drag, right?
Drag torque coefficient. linear torque
Drag torque coefficient. linear torque
coefficient.
I don't think we're using
RPM scale.
Oh, well, this is backwards.
Yeah, that's backwards. So, that'll
Yeah, that's backwards. So, that'll
that'll do it.
Okay. But now I can't fly.
No, I can.
No, I can.
It's just very bad at flying.
It's just very bad at flying.
Let's see if we can train something on
Let's see if we can train something on
this.
And then what I'm going to do is I'm
And then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to move this to a not broken
going to move this to a not broken
version. I'll commit this and I'll ch
version. I'll commit this and I'll ch
I'll chat with um Finn and Sam
on like how we can get this to into
on like how we can get this to into
their stuff.
Like we'll just give them like a little
Like we'll just give them like a little
bit of domain randomization and a very
bit of domain randomization and a very
like even just give them a little bit of
like even just give them a little bit of
domain randomization will be fine.
Uh, this says it's learning.
Uh, this says it's learning.
Maybe it was just a control problem.
It's learning.
It's learning.
We'll see if this crashes the laptop
We'll see if this crashes the laptop
again. Hopefully not.
Okay. 97%.
So,
yeah, look at that.
This is a pretty dang good approximation
This is a pretty dang good approximation
to like a big slow drone, right?
It's a good approximation.
That's not bad.
That's not bad.
Let's try zippy drone.
What do we think?
So, the smallest drone we would ever do
So, the smallest drone we would ever do
is like this probably, right?
Try this. See if it works.
So if this trains, if we get this to
So if this trains, if we get this to
train, then that means that we can train
train, then that means that we can train
whatever we want and we can train all of
whatever we want and we can train all of
them.
And this seems like it works.
And this seems like it works.
Yeah, this seems like it works very
Yeah, this seems like it works very
well.
There we are.
H I honestly I didn't expect to get this
H I honestly I didn't expect to get this
fully working in just like a few hours,
fully working in just like a few hours,
but um I think we have it.
Episode length 200.
Episode length 200.
Yeah, this is going to be a crazy zippy
Yeah, this is going to be a crazy zippy
drone.
Oh yeah, that zippy drone, right? Look
Oh yeah, that zippy drone, right? Look
at that zippy drone.
Cool.
Cool.
Now, here's the question. Both of these
Now, here's the question. Both of these
work, right? All these actually work.
work, right? All these actually work.
These are all of our uh both of our
These are all of our uh both of our
configs.
So, can we get this to work, which is
So, can we get this to work, which is
going to be the randomized one
from 0.05 to 0.08.
If this works,
If this works,
this will be the equivalent of flying
this will be the equivalent of flying
any drone
any drone
uh from like this big up to about
uh from like this big up to about
like this this big.
So, pretty much all commercial drones
So, pretty much all commercial drones
like except like the ridiculously big
like except like the ridiculously big
ones, which we can do that as well. We'd
ones, which we can do that as well. We'd
have to make the force bigger because
have to make the force bigger because
they don't fit through the rings.
It is training.
It is training.
Understandably,
you know, when you add domain
you know, when you add domain
randomization,
randomization,
um, it depends on it depends on if your
um, it depends on it depends on if your
problem is sparse or not. If your
problem is sparse or not. If your
problem is dense, typically it will take
problem is dense, typically it will take
longer to train. If your problem is
longer to train. If your problem is
sparse, it can actually be faster to
sparse, it can actually be faster to
train. This is a dense problem, so we
train. This is a dense problem, so we
would expect that this is going to take
would expect that this is going to take
uh longer to train.
I just want to see if we can get some
I just want to see if we can get some
reasonable PF out of this to
Okay. So like 90%
with just a minute of training with the
with just a minute of training with the
same like tiny little network. It's
same like tiny little network. It's
fine. 87.
fine. 87.
That's still a good result though.
That's still a good result though.
I mean, I think you'll see when we eval
I mean, I think you'll see when we eval
this.
I would think that this one should be
I would think that this one should be
faster.
faster.
It might just be controlling it very
It might just be controlling it very
conservatively because it doesn't want
conservatively because it doesn't want
to like screw up with the bigger drones.
to like screw up with the bigger drones.
Hey, Bat.
Hey, Bat.
Is this the Secretary of Defense that

you've just linked to me?
you've just linked to me?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Kind of a good time to be in the
Yeah. Kind of a good time to be in the

I'm sure they have no idea about any of
I'm sure they have no idea about any of
this.
This is controlling any drone. Like this
This is controlling any drone. Like this
is a this is a much bigger drone.
I mean that to be fair, they can
I mean that to be fair, they can
probably figure out how to hire a bunch
probably figure out how to hire a bunch
of people to pilot them manually.
But yeah, the autonomous one's harder.
Oh, you know why this is slow? Cuz I
Oh, you know why this is slow? Cuz I
messed with the FPS.
messed with the FPS.
This is this should be identical to
This is this should be identical to
before.
We don't have to retrain. We can just
We don't have to retrain. We can just
evaluate
autonomous tech is mandatory.
I mean, realistically, either of them is
I mean, realistically, either of them is
going to be a step up, but yeah,
going to be a step up, but yeah,
like it's massively it's a pretty
like it's massively it's a pretty
massive difference.
Okay, this is way better. So, now we
Okay, this is way better. So, now we
actually have something that looks
actually have something that looks
reasonable, right? Look, we've got zippy
reasonable, right? Look, we've got zippy
small drone. This is zippy small drone.
We've got like reasonably slower big

What's plus 26?
Oh, this.
Yeah. So, we are um depending on how
Yeah. So, we are um depending on how
this goes, like in the next couple of
this goes, like in the next couple of
days, I should be launching the guide

for 10K, which will be pretty cool.
Yeah. Well, get me to 10k followers and

we'll you'll have the guide.
It makes sense to do it. It's It was

He said deep mind got it to work

reasonably well internally. So if we had
reasonably well internally. So if we had
an open source of that it would be
an open source of that it would be
really awesome.
All right.
Yeah, like now that I think about it,
Yeah, like now that I think about it,
bet you could totally you don't even
bet you could totally you don't even
really need to do a search baseline
really need to do a search baseline
like at all if you don't want to.
You can pretty much just use Stockfish
You can pretty much just use Stockfish
for eval.
I do think though that like
literally
literally
well
well
just making random moves probably
just making random moves probably
doesn't get you very far. I don't know.
doesn't get you very far. I don't know.
I'd be kind of interested to know what
I'd be kind of interested to know what
elo it would be if you just make random

Welcome Jai.
No CUDA GPUs available. Lovely.
No CUDA GPUs available. Lovely.
Don't you love Docker?
Search is going to play into things.
Like you kind of get the idea though,
Like you kind of get the idea though,
right? Bet. Like we're just going to We
right? Bet. Like we're just going to We
just want to see how good of a chess
just want to see how good of a chess
thing we can train very very quickly to
thing we can train very very quickly to
like a reasonably good ELO. My
like a reasonably good ELO. My
5-year-old can beat pure random that
5-year-old can beat pure random that
doesn't blunder pieces. I highly doubt
doesn't blunder pieces. I highly doubt
that.
Oh, pure random. Yeah, of course.
If you never blunder a piece, I think
If you never blunder a piece, I think
that you actually already get to like
that you actually already get to like
a ELO that is above a brand new human
a ELO that is above a brand new human
player,
player,
right?
right?
Because humans aren't like you're not
Because humans aren't like you're not
making random moves, but you people
making random moves, but you people
blunder pieces even in long form chess
blunder pieces even in long form chess
up to like what 1500 or something like

It's kind of amusing how bad I am at

Let's say we show people the Neptune

I actually have no idea how hard chest

is bet. Like
is bet. Like
what what ELO is exact two-step search
what what ELO is exact two-step search
like two-step look ahead, right?
That's like a fun question to ask for a
That's like a fun question to ask for a
lot of these problems, right? What ELO
lot of these problems, right? What ELO
do you get by doing exact like one step,
do you get by doing exact like one step,
two step, three step, look ahead.
Okay, so we trained for 500 mil. We got
Okay, so we trained for 500 mil. We got
95% PF
and it's still going up, right?
and it's still going up, right?
Yeah, this is still going up.
Yeah, this is still going up.
So I think that if we literally just
screw it billion
billion steps is chunk change in puffer
Yeah. So, this is interesting. It's
Yeah. So, this is interesting. It's
actually
actually
not even near the previous performance.

Huh.
Well folks, what do we do when our

If it's a quick problem, you try just

cutting the learning rate in like half
cutting the learning rate in like half
first.
We will probably run a sweep anyways on

the machine.
Huh? It doesn't seem like it learns at
Huh? It doesn't seem like it learns at
all with lower learning rate. Isn't that
all with lower learning rate. Isn't that
funny?
That's something.
See, this is why uh hyper pamps
See, this is why uh hyper pamps
make absolutely no sense.
Try this one more time.
Yeah, absolutely right. If look, if even
Yeah, absolutely right. If look, if even
I can't like consistently make good

because we base them on uh exact like we

and it was very slow
and it was very slow
is the thing.
Amusingly,
the first set of hypers I set was the
the first set of hypers I set was the
best so far.
There was like a takeoff point, you

it like it kind of dipped up at the top
it like it kind of dipped up at the top
or at the end was interesting.
This is stable. Not really though. Like
This is stable. Not really though. Like
it's not

I'm going to try one other thing
I'm going to try one other thing
manually and then I'll just like run a

sweeper, whatever.
No. See, it's like it's not It kind of
No. See, it's like it's not It kind of
learned everything and it's kind of just

Yeah. Let's just do here. This is what
Yeah. Let's just do here. This is what
we'll do.
Go 500 mil
and we'll do policy

Give it a little extra capacity.
Oh yeah, it likes that.

out of the way. They try not to collide,
out of the way. They try not to collide,
so they move out of the way of each

It's at 94 95, it looks like.

The internet here is just like that

All
right. Well, stream looks like it's

the internet's completely fine, but
the internet's completely fine, but
Reream just drops. I have no idea why.
Well, let's keep going on this for a
Well, let's keep going on this for a
bit.
I might just get like I'm only here for
I might just get like I'm only here for
a week, but probably the next time I'm
a week, but probably the next time I'm
here I'll just get like Starlink or
here I'll just get like Starlink or
whatever because apparently Florida
whatever because apparently Florida
infrastructure just doesn't work.
I don't freaking know. Either like

it's weird that it happens even when I
it's weird that it happens even when I
see that like it seems stable, though. I
see that like it seems stable, though. I
don't know.
Isn't this like a pretty sizable
Isn't this like a pretty sizable
drone? This should look bigger than
drone? This should look bigger than
this. No.
Okay. That's like tiny drone.
Okay. That's like tiny drone.
But like 75
you know it should be bigger than that.
you know it should be bigger than that.
7.75 radius is quite large.
Okay. So, they have the
sphere.
Oh, no. This is right.
This is r / 2.
Then this is plus r minus r.
That seems right to me, but it's not.
This thing should be substantially
This thing should be substantially
bigger
bigger
than this, I would think.
Well, maybe not.
Okay. But then the ring should be
ring radius should only be 2 * the arm
ring radius should only be 2 * the arm
length four *
length four *
this.
this.
Okay.
So now I should be able to do
Yeah. So that's a big drone, right?
So we're going to want to do
So we're going to want to do
Let's say the scale of things that we
Let's say the scale of things that we
want to look at is going to be
want to look at is going to be
everything from like
point
05 or something 5 cm
up to maybe
up to maybe
couple of feet initially.
So, nowhere near this big.
So, let's do like this. Let's see what
So, let's do like this. Let's see what
this does.
this does.
You're not going to be able to see this.
You're not going to be able to see this.
The thing it's like this little tiny
The thing it's like this little tiny
point down here.
Can you actually control this? I wonder.
Let's train this. And then afterwards
Let's train this. And then afterwards
what we'll do is we'll see if we can
what we'll do is we'll see if we can
randomize the size and learn over
randomize the size and learn over
different sizes. Yes.
Interesting. So, this does not
Interesting. So, this does not
does not work.
Let's see if we can make the rings
Let's see if we can make the rings
bigger.
Oops.
We can also randomize the target size.
Yeah, this is not training at all
Yeah, this is not training at all
though, which is a little odd. Okay,
though, which is a little odd. Okay,
let's go back to like what? 0.1
let's go back to like what? 0.1
or I think 0.2 was our original
Okay, this is annoying. It's um
We're actually still not learning.
These were mostly rendering changes,
These were mostly rendering changes,
weren't they?
It can fly around and not crash, but it
It can fly around and not crash, but it
can't figure out how to get in the
can't figure out how to get in the
ranks.
Okay. So, now it's actually doing
Okay. So, now it's actually doing
something.
It is having a tough time though.
It is having a tough time though.
Okay, so what did I break in the process
Okay, so what did I break in the process
of doing this?
Yeah, I totally broke something.
Yeah, you can see here it's not um
it's not
is the policy observing from first
is the policy observing from first
person or 3D person camera. Uh neither.
person or 3D person camera. Uh neither.
It's just getting it's relative state
It's just getting it's relative state
based estimate. So, when we throw this
based estimate. So, when we throw this
on real hardware, we're just going to
on real hardware, we're just going to
have to do some like really basic
have to do some like really basic
perception,
perception,
uh, not even end to end to just figure
uh, not even end to end to just figure
out where the rings are or like figure
out where the rings are or like figure
out where the target is.
You ideally don't really want to do end
You ideally don't really want to do end
to end camera. Uh, if you can avoid it
to end camera. Uh, if you can avoid it
for quite a while, you just make
for quite a while, you just make
everything between 100 and a thousand
everything between 100 and a thousand
times slower.
We can absolutely do stuff like um you
We can absolutely do stuff like um you
know put the ring like the ring position
know put the ring like the ring position
only if it's in the vision cone or
only if it's in the vision cone or
something. That's easy.
Okay. Okay. What did I mess up here?
The rings look smaller than before.
The rings look smaller than before.
Yeah, they're definitely smaller than
Yeah, they're definitely smaller than
before, right?
Yeah. So this is how it worked before.
Okay, now it trains.
Okay, now it trains.
It needs really big rings.
We were doing 0.1
before. No, we were doing 0.2 before.
before. No, we were doing 0.2 before.
So, we'll go 08.
So, we'll go 08.
So, times four in either direction, I
So, times four in either direction, I
suppose.
suppose.
And then we'll do like this.
And then we'll do like this.
We'll give it a small amount of uh
We'll give it a small amount of uh
domain randomization. Done.
Cool.
So, if we can get something sort of
So, if we can get something sort of
similar to this to train, then this is
similar to this to train, then this is
something I can show to Ben and uh Sam
something I can show to Ben and uh Sam
and we can check the formulas. Hey,
and we can check the formulas. Hey,
Kirthy. Yeah, I'm in uh Florida for a
Kirthy. Yeah, I'm in uh Florida for a
little bit and then I'll be in
little bit and then I'll be in
California thereafter. So, we're kind of
California thereafter. So, we're kind of
making do on a laptop setup for now. And
making do on a laptop setup for now. And
if the uh
if the uh
the internet is not amazing,
the internet is not amazing,
OBS likes to crash every so often,
OBS likes to crash every so often,
but we're making do
Okay. So, like this does train
Okay. So, like this does train
and it is fairly stable.
and it is fairly stable.
I don't know what the best you can get
I don't know what the best you can get
is out of this, but let's see what the
is out of this, but let's see what the
policy looks like that does this.
What are you cooking?
What are you cooking?
So, we've got we're trying to make the
So, we've got we're trying to make the
the same uh the same RL able to fly a
the same uh the same RL able to fly a
ton of different types of drones.
ton of different types of drones.
Now, they're hard to see because like
Now, they're hard to see because like
we're now working on really, really
we're now working on really, really
small ones,
but I'm trying to randomize like the
but I'm trying to randomize like the
physics, randomize the drone parameters
physics, randomize the drone parameters
and get it to be able to fly pretty much
and get it to be able to fly pretty much
any different drone.
So, this is a big drone right here.
So, this is a big drone right here.
You can see that the control is not
You can see that the control is not
exactly
exactly
reasonable. And that's not because of
reasonable. And that's not because of
the physics of this thing. It's just
the physics of this thing. It's just
because I've scaled everything wrong.
Yeah. So, the ones that like shoot
Yeah. So, the ones that like shoot
around like crazy are not going to be
around like crazy are not going to be
super learnable. Yeah.
All right. Let's see if we can figure
All right. Let's see if we can figure
out from the math
out from the math
what I've done wrong here. It's all
what I've done wrong here. It's all
here, right? So, it's just the scaling
here, right? So, it's just the scaling

is somehow screwy.
Folks are uh you can feel free to tell
Folks are uh you can feel free to tell
me if I've screwed up physics if you

know this type of stuff.
So the mass is going to scale
So the mass is going to scale
cubic with the size

that seems fine
that seems fine
plus or - 10%.
Then you got the inertia scale
Then you got the inertia scale
which is mass time arm length time arm
which is mass time arm length time arm

that also can be plus or minus 10%.
that also can be plus or minus 10%.
Thrust
why is thrust proportional to mass?
why is thrust proportional to mass?
Okay. Thrust.
It's probably the RPM being scaled weird
It's probably the RPM being scaled weird
now.
We'll see how this uh trains by
We'll see how this uh trains by
comparison.
75 follows away from uh releasing the
75 follows away from uh releasing the
new RL guide.
I will have to make the images for that
I will have to make the images for that
later.
Okay, this did not help.
Okay, this did not help.
Presumably the drones are like falling
Presumably the drones are like falling
out of the sky or something. because
out of the sky or something. because
they're not able to keep themselves up.
Let's watch it a little bit. So, these
Let's watch it a little bit. So, these
are the tiny ones.
The tiny ones are kind of fine. They zip
The tiny ones are kind of fine. They zip
around.
around.
They've got quite a bit of um
I don't handle they don't handle super
I don't handle they don't handle super
well.
I don't know what that's trying to do.
Oh, wait. Did I mess up the uh Did I
Oh, wait. Did I mess up the uh Did I
mess up the the Z inertia?
I think I messed up the Z inertia,
I think I messed up the Z inertia,
didn't I?
Let's try this.
Oh, actually I don't know if it's Y or
Oh, actually I don't know if it's Y or
Z. Yeah, hang on.
Yep. Z. Okay.
So
if we fix that weird inertia scale
it does
This is worse than before by a lot,
This is worse than before by a lot,
isn't it? Well, I guess we'll see how it
isn't it? Well, I guess we'll see how it
converges.
So far, very bad.
Oh, because it's not proportional to
Oh, because it's not proportional to
mass. Hang on.
Okay. So, it does get to like 60ish%.
And then let's make this proportional to
And then let's make this proportional to
mass correctly.
And then after this what we can do
this put this into gro
up and computer's crash.

Lovely.
Huh?

I guess we're alive.

Um,
it's like the same problem with all the

It's like very slow.
It's like very slow.
So, I've mostly just still been using
So, I've mostly just still been using
Brock Great.
Yeah, it's really slow, right?
And like I asked something fairly basic
Mass distributed radially.
Okay.
Okay.
Scales L to the 5th. Fine. That was a
Scales L to the 5th. Fine. That was a
dumb thing to do anyways.
Oops.

And there goes the computer again.
And there goes the computer again.
Yeah, it's completely locked up for some

reason.
Am I out of memory or something? What
Am I out of memory or something? What

No, I'm not.
That's just Linux being Linux, I guess.
That's just Linux being Linux, I guess.
I have no idea. Just randomly locks up

it doesn't.
This is just a This is just a bun. I'm
This is just a This is just a bun. I'm
not even doing anything weird.
You know what Isaac Lab is? Yeah.
We've done contract work in Isaac Jim,
We've done contract work in Isaac Jim,
even though that's old.
We wouldn't need Isaac Lab for something
We wouldn't need Isaac Lab for something
like this.
It's just going to be slower than what
It's just going to be slower than what
we're doing here and 10 times the amount
we're doing here and 10 times the amount

the rest of weight decreases

as one over L. Interesting.
Would you recommend Isaac Lab for vision
Would you recommend Isaac Lab for vision
based RL?
No,
No,
not at all.
not at all.
Um,
like if I had to do vision for this, I
like if I had to do vision for this, I
would still keep the logic. I would keep
would still keep the logic. I would keep
the logic like I have it here and then I
the logic like I have it here and then I
would hook it up to the batch renderer
would hook it up to the batch renderer
of any of these engines, but I wouldn't
of any of these engines, but I wouldn't
use the engine itself. Like I think
use the engine itself. Like I think
Madrona has a decent more almost
Madrona has a decent more almost
standalone batch renderer. I'd probably
standalone batch renderer. I'd probably
just try to get like a standalone batch
just try to get like a standalone batch
renderer
renderer
if that makes sense.
Like all the main physics engines are
Like all the main physics engines are
just really bloated and slow
just really bloated and slow
and you have no idea what they're doing
and you have no idea what they're doing
half the time. They're just slow and
half the time. They're just slow and
like screw you if you want to figure out
like screw you if you want to figure out
why. This is just like layers and layers
why. This is just like layers and layers
and layers of stuff.
We do I over L.
We keep it as I
quadratic with the area.
scale is L²
max RPM decrease. recess.
I think that this is going to be
this is going to like not make it able
this is going to like not make it able
to fly, but we'll figure that out.
Okay, this is closer to the original
Okay, this is closer to the original
dynamics.
Now, if I
Now, if I
if I say that the drone is going to be
if I say that the drone is going to be
substantially bigger.
Yeah, that's not it.
I have no idea what that is, but that
I have no idea what that is, but that
ain't it.
mass scale is fine.
There's K drag and B drag, right?
Drag torque coefficient. linear torque
Drag torque coefficient. linear torque
coefficient.
I don't think we're using
RPM scale.
Oh, well, this is backwards.
Yeah, that's backwards. So, that'll
Yeah, that's backwards. So, that'll
that'll do it.
Okay. But now I can't fly.
No, I can.
No, I can.
It's just very bad at flying.
It's just very bad at flying.
Let's see if we can train something on
Let's see if we can train something on
this.
And then what I'm going to do is I'm
And then what I'm going to do is I'm
going to move this to a not broken
going to move this to a not broken
version. I'll commit this and I'll ch
version. I'll commit this and I'll ch
I'll chat with um Finn and Sam
on like how we can get this to into
on like how we can get this to into
their stuff.
Like we'll just give them like a little
Like we'll just give them like a little
bit of domain randomization and a very
bit of domain randomization and a very
like even just give them a little bit of
like even just give them a little bit of
domain randomization will be fine.
Uh, this says it's learning.
Uh, this says it's learning.
Maybe it was just a control problem.
It's learning.
It's learning.
We'll see if this crashes the laptop
We'll see if this crashes the laptop
again. Hopefully not.
Okay. 97%.
So,
yeah, look at that.
This is a pretty dang good approximation
This is a pretty dang good approximation
to like a big slow drone, right?
It's a good approximation.
That's not bad.
That's not bad.
Let's try zippy drone.
What do we think?
So, the smallest drone we would ever do
So, the smallest drone we would ever do
is like this probably, right?
Try this. See if it works.
So if this trains, if we get this to
So if this trains, if we get this to
train, then that means that we can train
train, then that means that we can train
whatever we want and we can train all of
whatever we want and we can train all of
them.
And this seems like it works.
And this seems like it works.
Yeah, this seems like it works very
Yeah, this seems like it works very
well.
There we are.
H I honestly I didn't expect to get this
H I honestly I didn't expect to get this
fully working in just like a few hours,
fully working in just like a few hours,
but um I think we have it.
Episode length 200.
Episode length 200.
Yeah, this is going to be a crazy zippy
Yeah, this is going to be a crazy zippy
drone.
Oh yeah, that zippy drone, right? Look
Oh yeah, that zippy drone, right? Look
at that zippy drone.
Cool.
Cool.
Now, here's the question. Both of these
Now, here's the question. Both of these
work, right? All these actually work.
work, right? All these actually work.
These are all of our uh both of our
These are all of our uh both of our
configs.
So, can we get this to work, which is
So, can we get this to work, which is
going to be the randomized one
from 0.05 to 0.08.
If this works,
If this works,
this will be the equivalent of flying
this will be the equivalent of flying
any drone
any drone
uh from like this big up to about
uh from like this big up to about
like this this big.
So, pretty much all commercial drones
So, pretty much all commercial drones
like except like the ridiculously big
like except like the ridiculously big
ones, which we can do that as well. We'd
ones, which we can do that as well. We'd
have to make the force bigger because
have to make the force bigger because
they don't fit through the rings.
It is training.
It is training.
Understandably,
you know, when you add domain
you know, when you add domain
randomization,
randomization,
um, it depends on it depends on if your
um, it depends on it depends on if your
problem is sparse or not. If your
problem is sparse or not. If your
problem is dense, typically it will take
problem is dense, typically it will take
longer to train. If your problem is
longer to train. If your problem is
sparse, it can actually be faster to
sparse, it can actually be faster to
train. This is a dense problem, so we
train. This is a dense problem, so we
would expect that this is going to take
would expect that this is going to take
uh longer to train.
I just want to see if we can get some
I just want to see if we can get some
reasonable PF out of this to
Okay. So like 90%
with just a minute of training with the
with just a minute of training with the
same like tiny little network. It's
same like tiny little network. It's
fine. 87.
fine. 87.
That's still a good result though.
That's still a good result though.
I mean, I think you'll see when we eval
I mean, I think you'll see when we eval
this.
I would think that this one should be
I would think that this one should be
faster.
faster.
It might just be controlling it very
It might just be controlling it very
conservatively because it doesn't want
conservatively because it doesn't want
to like screw up with the bigger drones.
to like screw up with the bigger drones.
Hey, Bat.
Hey, Bat.
Is this the Secretary of Defense that

you've just linked to me?
you've just linked to me?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Kind of a good time to be in the
Yeah. Kind of a good time to be in the
space.
I'm sure they have no idea about any of
I'm sure they have no idea about any of
this.
This is controlling any drone. Like this
This is controlling any drone. Like this
is a this is a much bigger drone.
I mean that to be fair, they can
I mean that to be fair, they can
probably figure out how to hire a bunch
probably figure out how to hire a bunch
of people to pilot them manually.
But yeah, the autonomous one's harder.
Oh, you know why this is slow? Cuz I
Oh, you know why this is slow? Cuz I
messed with the FPS.
messed with the FPS.
This is this should be identical to
This is this should be identical to
before.
We don't have to retrain. We can just
We don't have to retrain. We can just
evaluate
autonomous tech is mandatory.
I mean, realistically, either of them is
I mean, realistically, either of them is
going to be a step up, but yeah,
going to be a step up, but yeah,
like it's massively it's a pretty
like it's massively it's a pretty
massive difference.
Okay, this is way better. So, now we
Okay, this is way better. So, now we
actually have something that looks
actually have something that looks
reasonable, right? Look, we've got zippy
reasonable, right? Look, we've got zippy
small drone. This is zippy small drone.
We've got like reasonably slower big

This is fly whatever drone.
Let's commit this all up.
Okay, I will push that up off stream in

Well,
yeah. But anyways,
where Finn and Sam?
Where are Finn and Sam?
Let me actually just I know how I know

So that's uh that is live. You all can

play with that.
Plus 26.
Plus 26.
What's plus 26?
Oh, this.
Yeah. So, we are um depending on how
Yeah. So, we are um depending on how
this goes, like in the next couple of
this goes, like in the next couple of
days, I should be launching the guide
days, I should be launching the guide
for 10K, which will be pretty cool.
Yeah. Well, get me to 10k followers and
Yeah. Well, get me to 10k followers and
we'll you'll have the guide.
It makes sense to do it. It's It was

Sure,
we appreciate the outreach.
That was outreach before we were doing

I would very much like to have like a

He said deep mind got it to work

reasonably well internally. So if we had
reasonably well internally. So if we had
an open source of that it would be
an open source of that it would be
really awesome.
All right.
Yeah, like now that I think about it,
Yeah, like now that I think about it,
bet you could totally you don't even
bet you could totally you don't even
really need to do a search baseline
really need to do a search baseline
like at all if you don't want to.
You can pretty much just use Stockfish
You can pretty much just use Stockfish
for eval.
I do think though that like
literally
literally
well
well
just making random moves probably
just making random moves probably
doesn't get you very far. I don't know.
doesn't get you very far. I don't know.
I'd be kind of interested to know what
I'd be kind of interested to know what
elo it would be if you just make random

Welcome Jai.
No CUDA GPUs available. Lovely.

Don't you love Docker?
Search is going to play into things.
Like you kind of get the idea though,
Like you kind of get the idea though,
right? Bet. Like we're just going to We
right? Bet. Like we're just going to We
just want to see how good of a chess

thing we can train very very quickly to

like a reasonably good ELO. My
like a reasonably good ELO. My
5-year-old can beat pure random that
5-year-old can beat pure random that
doesn't blunder pieces. I highly doubt
doesn't blunder pieces. I highly doubt
that.
Oh, pure random. Yeah, of course.
If you never blunder a piece, I think
If you never blunder a piece, I think
that you actually already get to like
that you actually already get to like
a ELO that is above a brand new human
a ELO that is above a brand new human
player,

right?
right?
Because humans aren't like you're not
Because humans aren't like you're not
making random moves, but you people

blunder pieces even in long form chess
blunder pieces even in long form chess
up to like what 1500 or something like

Let's say we show people the Neptune

I actually have no idea how hard chest

what what ELO is exact two-step search
what what ELO is exact two-step search
like two-step look ahead, right?
That's like a fun question to ask for a
That's like a fun question to ask for a
lot of these problems, right? What ELO
lot of these problems, right? What ELO
do you get by doing exact like one step,
do you get by doing exact like one step,
two step, three step, look ahead.
Okay, so we trained for 500 mil. We got

95% PF
and it's still going up, right?
and it's still going up, right?
Yeah, this is still going up.
Yeah, this is still going up.
So I think that if we literally just
screw it billion

Yeah. So, this is interesting. It's
Yeah. So, this is interesting. It's
actually
actually
not even near the previous performance.

We will probably run a sweep anyways on

Huh? It doesn't seem like it learns at
Huh? It doesn't seem like it learns at
all with lower learning rate. Isn't that
all with lower learning rate. Isn't that
funny?
That's something.
See, this is why uh hyper pamps
See, this is why uh hyper pamps
make absolutely no sense.
Try this one more time.
Yeah, absolutely right. If look, if even

because we base them on uh exact like we

Amusingly,
the first set of hypers I set was the
the first set of hypers I set was the
best so far.
There was like a takeoff point, you

it like it kind of dipped up at the top

I'm going to try one other thing

No. See, it's like it's not It kind of
No. See, it's like it's not It kind of
learned everything and it's kind of just

Yeah. Let's just do here. This is what
Yeah. Let's just do here. This is what
we'll do.
Go 500 mil
and we'll do policy

so they move out of the way of each
