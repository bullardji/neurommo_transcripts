we are

live
um I am back there's a ludicrous amount
um I am back there's a ludicrous amount
of stuff stacked up to
of stuff stacked up to
fix I'm going to figure out what the
fix I'm going to figure out what the
heck needs fixing and just start going
heck needs fixing and just start going
through a bunch of stuff
Dynamic the
heck okay this is
weird yeah so there needs to be some
weird yeah so there needs to be some
change
change
there um
where did this go
oh here it is it's just a thread here
so e
okay got that I believe we have some
okay got that I believe we have some
support stuff on e3b to deal with
next yeah okay so there's something
next yeah okay so there's something
weird with e3b let me figure this out
oops this here
I guess the first thing to do is just
I guess the first thing to do is just
going to be
let's see if this uh how this
increases so we'll see if this uh
increases so we'll see if this uh
continues to increase or
not nope
consistent so there's no memory
leak let me go see what uh what version
leak let me go see what uh what version
they currently have that I
they currently have that I
pr yeah this is not no memory leak in my
pr yeah this is not no memory leak in my
version and I push
version and I push
this yeah these are just anyes this is
this yeah these are just anyes this is
fine
oh wait I didn't push this
oh wait I didn't push this
[ __ ] okay I didn't push this
um how far through this did I
get I thought I sent them a PR
did I just not send them a
PR I don't know
PR I don't know
man last week was like stupid
busy for
and then I got to figure out the Run
and then I got to figure out the Run
command for this
let me find the freaking command
I miss run
oops no not like
that I think it was just
runer for
okay so now we can
do we can do this and
see yeah there we
see yeah there we
go uh is this we'll just have to watch
go uh is this we'll just have to watch
this for a little bit to see if there's
this for a little bit to see if there's
any memory issue for
okay so this is I forgot the hardware
flag so we'll see if this one
uh if this one is
worse see how much this uses
look stable to
me
me
oops
oops
[Music]
Dam dam is fine
and memory is it
stable yeah that looks stable
oh I just noticed is there
literally H there's a screenshot on the
literally H there's a screenshot on the
terminal that's funny
okay so that is pushed
yeah that's all separate we don't care
yeah that's all separate we don't care
with
that solid okay so this is
that solid okay so this is
done
um add a PR that fix I just
made
HFF can't merge
why is
this got my compute cluster back good
this got my compute cluster back good
for you ours is

like if you were to run experiments on

just running one experiment on the

would be about four or five times

slower um also we want to be able to run

slightly larger policies so it's very
slightly larger policies so it's very
bad to just invest in CPU only infra um
bad to just invest in CPU only infra um
because we're not going to be running

100K policies for f for right we will'll

be running like million parameter
be running like million parameter

um I don't think it's horribly cheaper
um I don't think it's horribly cheaper
either cu the GPU is adding about
either cu the GPU is adding about
2500 to the price of the machine um like
2500 to the price of the machine um like
there's still the high-end
there's still the high-end
CPU uh and the RAM and everything like I
CPU uh and the RAM and everything like I
guess you down the power supply bit
but we probably could get some decent

CPU boxes for like 2500 instead of 5,500

yeah um it's a really bad direction to

bet on scalability wise
bet on scalability wise
though 4 to 5x yeah we see um I mean

that's only for the really small

a really nice
post the other thing uh I'd like to
post the other thing uh I'd like to
mention with the problems that RL has at

the moment is RL hasn't even had the
the moment is RL hasn't even had the
benefit of billions of dollars of

investment like llms have so like it's
investment like llms have so like it's
kind of amazing that any anything works
kind of amazing that any anything works
at all and it's actually very reasonable

to get expect stuff to get a lot better
to get expect stuff to get a lot better
and in fact it's not just going to be

hopefully help with generalization a
hopefully help with generalization a
little bit but then it'll definitely
little bit but then it'll definitely
help with generalization research
help with generalization research
because just RL in general will be a lot

I don't think that llms with or without

RL solve everything in the way they're

another model so if you have like
another model so if you have like
general purpose tokenizing and you train
general purpose tokenizing and you train
your LMS on everything then you can just
your LMS on everything then you can just
do that um but like we can currently
do that um but like we can currently
train on about as much data as all of
train on about as much data as all of
gp4 for instance on one
gp4 for instance on one
GPU so there's just like a massive
GPU so there's just like a massive
difference in data scale and RL scales
difference in data scale and RL scales
really well with data so that we're
really well with data so that we're
going to have to square that at some
going to have to square that at some
point and I definitely think that
point and I definitely think that
language models are abs like an
language models are abs like an
absolutely terrible domain for like
absolutely terrible domain for like
figuring out what works in RL and what
figuring out what works in RL and what
doesn't because everything is just so
doesn't because everything is just so
slow so like we're going to be the ones
slow so like we're going to be the ones
here making tons of quick progress
here making tons of quick progress
because we are just we can do stuff fast

right so like I think that puffer even

as just like a small in just like a very
as just like a small in just like a very
small lab really with mostly just you

going to be able to be producing results
going to be able to be producing results
uh with the speed on the scale of some
uh with the speed on the scale of some
of the bigger Labs cuz our stuff is a
of the bigger Labs cuz our stuff is a
thousand times
faster here let's get some cool stuff up
[Music]
want to show off my new uh some of the
want to show off my new uh some of the
new stuff I've been working
on how' that happen
include
grid. yeah this is my code
oh yeah that's
funny I guess I was
uh I guess this was like the last couple
uh I guess this was like the last couple
edits I made when I was falling asleep
edits I made when I was falling asleep
that's fine we'll fix that real
quick here we go so here's your
quick here we go so here's your
Maze and you can control this
Maze and you can control this
puffer and we can try to get him to
puffer and we can try to get him to
solve the maze right
and I haven't handled resets correctly
and I haven't handled resets correctly
yet but there you go
trying to think how I want to finish
trying to think how I want to finish
this think
this think
we fix the resets
we fix the resets
first we make a couple Standalone
first we make a couple Standalone
functions for that for different types
functions for that for different types
of tasks we bind the scon and we call a
of tasks we bind the scon and we call a
day
have to do observation function though
have to do observation function though
that's pretty
easy right so the other thing was was
easy right so the other thing was was
caching this
let us
initially maybe I should just initially
initially maybe I should just initially
have it be the maze task and then add
have it be the maze task and then add
stuff in
stuff in
after um
you kind of
need it's a little tricky now I'm
need it's a little tricky now I'm
thinking about it how we're going to do
thinking about it how we're going to do
the resets and
stuff set this one thing before I start
stuff set this one thing before I start
cuz I just remember
cuz I just remember
there's a a meeting I have set that I
there's a a meeting I have set that I
need to set a reminder for
perfect do you believe in the rewards
perfect do you believe in the rewards
enough enough
hypothesis I'm I mean it doesn't really
hypothesis I'm I mean it doesn't really
tell you anything on its own right
tell you anything on its own right
because if you have like an ideal reward
because if you have like an ideal reward
signal is just imitating an ideal is
signal is just imitating an ideal is
imitating a perfect policy
imitating a perfect policy
right which is not what we actually
right which is not what we actually
usually mean by that um so basically
usually mean by that um so basically
most of the stuff that we do in RL is to
most of the stuff that we do in RL is to
get around the fact that we almost never
get around the fact that we almost never
have a perfect reward signal like this
have a perfect reward signal like this
so in some sense yes but you never have
so in some sense yes but you never have
the perfect signal so you kind of have
the perfect signal so you kind of have
to do some extra things
to do some extra things
um yeah something like
that I'm trying to think if there's a
that I'm trying to think if there's a
way
when you call in in
when you call in in
it intelligence
about optimizing a
about optimizing a
fixed well the thing is it depends how
fixed well the thing is it depends how
you define the reward function right
you define the reward function right
because if the function can be
because if the function can be
anything right
anything right
then it's like okay yeah technically you
then it's like okay yeah technically you
could probably cast anything like
could probably cast anything like
that it's like an intentionally poorly
that it's like an intentionally poorly
specified
specified
statement right it's not
statement right it's not
specified it's a too vague of a
specified it's a too vague of a
statement to really make any conclusion
statement to really make any conclusion
about like
that e
I'm trying to think how I want to do
this what do you actually have to do to
this what do you actually have to do to
reset the environment at the moment you
reset the environment at the moment you
just respawn the
just respawn the
agent and remake the Border that's kind
agent and remake the Border that's kind
of
weird oh but your m setting to zero the
weird oh but your m setting to zero the
yeah okay that's very
yeah okay that's very
weird it's probably yeah it's because of
weird it's probably yeah it's because of
the uh the various
entities AI
entities AI
controlled I highly doubt
that I mean in Atari is a very limited
that I mean in Atari is a very limited
and kind of crappy Benchmark frankly
okay this reset function is not very
good you should honestly have to reset
good you should honestly have to reset
it
with yeah you should just the reset
with yeah you should just the reset
should just be a mem
should just be a mem
copy that's what this should be
these things end up mattering a lot
these things end up mattering a lot
because otherwise I like I don't want to
because otherwise I like I don't want to
spend the next three hours writing a
spend the next three hours writing a
bunch of useless
bunch of useless
code
code
um I think probably all I have to do
um I think probably all I have to do
is so reset does have to set Tick an
is so reset does have to set Tick an
episode Return To Zero and stuff like
episode Return To Zero and stuff like
this but for this side I think this just
goes this goes into a
net we haven't loaded the level though
maybe it's a load level
maybe it's a load level
function where does reward come from and
function where does reward come from and
how yeah
it's I mean we're
it's I mean we're
already I'm under no you know false
already I'm under no you know false
Impressions that the M's that we have
Impressions that the M's that we have
are complex enough either right the
are complex enough either right the
thing is though they are a lot better
thing is though they are a lot better
than what's out there at at the moment
than what's out there at at the moment
and uh they're going to help us do you
and uh they're going to help us do you
know a whole new generation of RL
know a whole new generation of RL
research and then if you think second
research and then if you think second
order right maybe that's enough to get
order right maybe that's enough to get
people really interested in RL not just
people really interested in RL not just
for llms and maybe we make RL stable and
for llms and maybe we make RL stable and
consistent enough for a bunch of
consistent enough for a bunch of
Industries to pick it up so that you
Industries to pick it up so that you
know puffer can get a good chunk of
know puffer can get a good chunk of
Revenue off of that and we can even you
Revenue off of that and we can even you
know start scaling more research so you
know start scaling more research so you
know we're kind of the way I have this
know we're kind of the way I have this
set
set
up um
up um
it's not because what you see is the end
it's not because what you see is the end
plan the stuff that you see is stuff I'm
plan the stuff that you see is stuff I'm
very proud of but it's not the end
very proud of but it's not the end
plan I mean stuff like this though
plan I mean stuff like this though
really shows you the potential I really
really shows you the potential I really
like neural MMOs and environment it's
like neural MMOs and environment it's
not even a full MMO though right it has
not even a full MMO though right it has
like an economy system it's got fighting
like an economy system it's got fighting
it's got some leveling but it's not a
it's got some leveling but it's not a
full
full
MMO and a full MMO probably isn't enough
MMO and a full MMO probably isn't enough
either but it's probably two generations
either but it's probably two generations
of progress not just one
now all we got to do is get the
now all we got to do is get the
generational progress time down to about
generational progress time down to about
a year and we'll be
good okay I don't like how this is done
good okay I don't like how this is done
either I think it's got to be like load
either I think it's got to be like load
level or some shenanigans
I don't know why this is
I don't know why this is
difficult really shouldn't be
I mean I'm not 100%
I mean I'm not 100%
today but still
a Kerbal end for peffer is that kfp
yeah I mean hey anybody who wants to
yeah I mean hey anybody who wants to
contribute n can do it right we have
contribute n can do it right we have
people working in all sorts of cool
people working in all sorts of cool
environment
projects this one here is somewhat
projects this one here is somewhat
urgent so I'm trying to Fig figure this
out okay maybe I'll just think through
out okay maybe I'll just think through
this out loud cuz the thing is I'm just
this out loud cuz the thing is I'm just
pretty tired still from uh travel was
pretty tired still from uh travel was
traveling all day yesterday um so let me
traveling all day yesterday um so let me
see if I can this is really basic but um
see if I can this is really basic but um
what I want to do is I want to basically
what I want to do is I want to basically
let you create level specs and then
let you create level specs and then
resetting to that level should just be a
resetting to that level should just be a
single mem copy which should be very
single mem copy which should be very
fast because actually generating the
fast because actually generating the
levels is slow but I can't have this be
levels is slow but I can't have this be
in the initialization because I want you
in the initialization because I want you
to basically be able to create a bunch
to basically be able to create a bunch
of levels outside of this and then uh
of levels outside of this and then uh
load them
load them
in
so what I need to do is have a
so what I need to do is have a
standalone level load
function uh which I already have
function uh which I already have
for these
for these
mazes and
then you just call that function a
bunch now the tricky thing here is that
bunch now the tricky thing here is that
you also have to specify like goal
you also have to specify like goal
position and agent position and
position and agent position and
such
um and that is not
yeah that's not defined by the
yeah that's not defined by the
environment which is the
problem okay so yeah that is the issue
problem okay so yeah that is the issue
is that you also have the agent
is that you also have the agent
position uh everything else is kind of
fine yeah literally everything else is
fine so I guess for now you can just
fine so I guess for now you can just
pass in the agent position directly
when you do load
when you do load
level but that's does that give you your
spec no that will give you your
spec so we'll just make it'll be a fair
spec so we'll just make it'll be a fair
bit simpler than
this so we'll just do void load
level and then this will take some
level and then this will take some
properties
I could also just allocate can I
I could also just allocate can I
allocate the memory
allocate the memory
contiguously I think technically I can I
contiguously I think technically I can I
could just allocate the memory
could just allocate the memory
continuously and copy the whole
continuously and copy the whole
environment
environment
state that would be kind of
cool so set State and get State instead
cool so set State and get State instead
of doing doing
this I don't know if that's better or
this I don't know if that's better or
not
not
howy
welcome I am sleepily trying to fix very
welcome I am sleepily trying to fix very
simple environment
problems it's too late for coffee as
well man you know
well man you know
the the freaking pneumonia makes
the the freaking pneumonia makes
everything so much worse because
I mean here look at this
I mean here look at this
mess where is
this come
on is this from
on is this from
today why is this not ever sync anything
I don't know why this didn't synchronize
I don't know why this didn't synchronize
I was going to show but basically it's
I was going to show but basically it's
like I have to train at 185 heart rate
like I have to train at 185 heart rate
to get anything done
yeah so the options here right are you
yeah so the options here right are you
try to come up
try to come up
with static
representation I mean how's this going
representation I mean how's this going
to work even if you just have it like
to work even if you just have it like
set the state of the grid and get the
set the state of the grid and get the
state of the
Grid it's like
Grid it's like
you still have to come up with a way to
you still have to come up with a way to
set the agents
right what's happening in Dev chat
okay so the two options you come up with
okay so the two options you come up with
a static representation you just set
a static representation you just set
make set State method
the only things you really need to do
the only things you really need to do
are
set I think it would actually be
set I think it would actually be
faster to just have set and get State
faster to just have set and get State
functions and you could probably use
functions and you could probably use
those for other stuff as
well so let's instead of making this be
well so let's instead of making this be
the whole level let's just
do right so we do this
right okay so that spawns the a
right okay so that spawns the a
agent at X and
agent at X and
Y spawn X
so we've got this generate
maze which I
like then we'll do create maze level
under
here create
here create
[Music]
maze learning
maze learning
rate 0.01 is very high for
rate 0.01 is very high for
po they don't need to they like yes the
po they don't need to they like yes the
hyper parameters are going to be
hyper parameters are going to be
different but that is a very large
different but that is a very large
difference like 01 is very high for po
look e
difficulty probably like this
not bad
spawn this one
here he minus two
okay so that's not
bad so this creates a maze
level and similarly we should be able to
level and similarly we should be able to
have the
um we should be able to have the locked
um we should be able to have the locked
room level right
yeah so this is what we had for locked
yeah so this is what we had for locked
room here
so here's your locked room preset
and then we'll make a create locked room
and then we'll make a create locked room
level
doesn't need seed nothing
random so we start by generating the
room and then we make the Border
and then the agent gets
spawned we'll leave this for
now this
this
19 I think this kind of does everything
19 I think this kind of does everything
except yeah this kind of does everything
except yeah this kind of does everything
for you to be
for you to be
honest but I think that we don't even
honest but I think that we don't even
need this is just
need this is just
redundant we'll figure out how to do
redundant we'll figure out how to do
this cleaner but this should be good for
now and then all we need to do is fix
now and then all we need to do is fix
the way states are allocated so let's do
the way states are allocated so let's do
that uh I got to go find the trick for
that uh I got to go find the trick for
that cuz there's a little trick
um that might be an issue
here
State can I do this in a
State can I do this in a
way let me see
so the problem is that there are
so the problem is that there are
observations actions rewards and DS in
observations actions rewards and DS in
here
this is also wait this is a pointer
okay so the set State thing is not going
okay so the set State thing is not going
to work exactly the way I was hoping it
to work exactly the way I was hoping it
would
work because this thing
contains pointers to
memory wait maybe that doesn't matter
wait yeah that doesn't matter because I
wait yeah that doesn't matter because I
can still allocate them in the same
can still allocate them in the same
memory
memory
right yes I
can do you use cloud Compu or have an

the only thing I got to be careful about

packing personal projects no it's it's

because you don't want to be renting

we will no longer have those problems
we will no longer have those problems
but yeah we've had a lot of hardware
but yeah we've had a lot of hardware
issues figuring out how to do everything
and also puffer is uh a bit more than a

doesn't flop like 40 40 series was great
I don't know what you're on about like
I don't know what you're on about like
the 40 series was
great I mean the only Hardware

the perf was pretty solid for uh thought

maybe the perf per dollar or something
maybe the perf per dollar or something
wasn't but it was a pretty substantial

just ordered AMD
just ordered AMD

we use a 9950 axis for our RL builds
well we I got one box with those and uh

here yeah so this is it with height n
agents can actually put this here
90 well it's more so that the uh the
90 well it's more so that the uh the
other chips are crazy
overpriced why are you using bandwidth
overpriced why are you using bandwidth
as why are you using
as why are you using
bandwidth what why is bandwidth your
bandwidth what why is bandwidth your
performance met
it's around 2300 ret no it's 2,000 is
it's around 2300 ret no it's 2,000 is
what it was advertised
as it's 2,300 if they put it in a box
as it's 2,300 if they put it in a box
for you
that looks like a very large
Improvement yeah except then there's the
Improvement yeah except then there's the
tensor core jump but then the thing is
tensor core jump but then the thing is
the tensor the tensor cores are also the
the tensor the tensor cores are also the
next generation of tensor cores so
next generation of tensor cores so
they're hard to compare one to
one for
how did I do this
before could do an
before could do an
allocator I could just
do yeah but you don't compare per watt
do yeah but you don't compare per watt
because you can't buy a better
because you can't buy a better
card so it's the price of the card goes
card so it's the price of the card goes
up by a few hundred bucks but then the
up by a few hundred bucks but then the
price of your whole box goes up by that
price of your whole box goes up by that
as well if you're GPU
bound well yeah the 2000 is actually
bound well yeah the 2000 is actually
very reasonable it's the uh the data
very reasonable it's the uh the data
center chips that aren't they're
center chips that aren't they're
literally they're at like 93% profit
literally they're at like 93% profit
margin there I mean they're practically
margin there I mean they're practically
the US Mint with their profit margin
I thought the founders Edition was
2K yeah Founders Edition
is oh
is oh
where's the
uh why do these look so [ __ ]
uh why do these look so [ __ ]
actually they had like a
actually they had like a
nice yeah what where do you buy this one
nice yeah what where do you buy this one
right
here this is the original chip right why
here this is the original chip right why
like they got all these uh these ones
like they got all these uh these ones
with separate fans on
them do they not sell the chip that the
them do they not sell the chip that the
freaking picture
is oh they got 80s
oh yeah AMD is just completely lost at
oh yeah AMD is just completely lost at
this
point I mean actually for gaming cards I
point I mean actually for gaming cards I
think that they just make lower end
think that they just make lower end
gaming cards for the most
gaming cards for the most
part is all they do on that front
40 s's well I didn't even know that they
40 s's well I didn't even know that they
made those
man I think that they're busy using
man I think that they're busy using
their silicon producing facilities for
their silicon producing facilities for
uh data center chips that are 10x the
price would be my guess
okay where's the clever
thing right here right
that's
weird I don't like it doesn't make sense
weird I don't like it doesn't make sense
to me why they would do
to me why they would do
that AMD software
that AMD software
guy well yeah I don't know what they're
guy well yeah I don't know what they're
doing they're just like they should have
doing they're just like they should have
just taken that offer the first time I
just taken that offer the first time I
don't know what's wrong with
them I think though honestly I think
them I think though honestly I think
that they just want to build I think
that they just want to build I think
they just want to make their CPUs and
they just want to make their CPUs and
not risk trying to compete with Nvidia
not risk trying to compete with Nvidia
at all I think that they just think that
at all I think that they just think that
they lose so they're not going to bother
they lose so they're not going to bother
they're just going to keep making CPUs
they're just going to keep making CPUs
and honestly like they kind of won the
and honestly like they kind of won the
CPU Market um I'd say with the latest
CPU Market um I'd say with the latest
Intel screw up I mean I've used Intel
Intel screw up I mean I've used Intel
chips exclusively for 15 years I'm never
chips exclusively for 15 years I'm never
buying another Intel
chip like they would have to double
chip like they would have to double
amd's performance now for me to even
amd's performance now for me to even
look at
look at
them that's how badly they screwed
up m i mean their chips they're making
up m i mean their chips they're making
good money on their chips though like
good money on their chips though like
they um the high-end CPUs right and
they um the high-end CPUs right and
workstations they got their thread
workstations they got their thread
rippers they've got pretty nice chips
rippers they've got pretty nice chips
for
for the gpus I mean you saw what Intel
for the gpus I mean you saw what Intel
did with their recent chips right like
did with their recent chips right like
nobody in their right mind should be
nobody in their right mind should be
buying Intel
buying Intel
CPUs um and anytime soon at least uh
CPUs um and anytime soon at least uh
desktop grade chips
that's
funny this does have the side effect
funny this does have the side effect
that I will not be able to
that I will not be able to
see um out of memory bound
see um out of memory bound

annoying working on similar RL beginner
annoying working on similar RL beginner

um we're currently working on a
um we're currently working on a
procedurally generated maze
procedurally generated maze
environment not sure if you're familiar
environment not sure if you're familiar
with some of the other stuff around here
with some of the other stuff around here
but our environments are good thousand
but our environments are good thousand
times faster than anything you're going
times faster than anything you're going
to find in
gy these are all playable online as
gy these are all playable online as
well with RL agents in the

generated maze environment for RL though
we're doing so rather slowly I got back
we're doing so rather slowly I got back
from vacation yesterday I'm still pretty
from vacation yesterday I'm still pretty
tired from traveling recent unit tree

gem um I did a fair bit on that last
gem um I did a fair bit on that last
week I've got a guy who's cleaning up
week I've got a guy who's cleaning up
some stuff around that over the next day
some stuff around that over the next day
or two and then I'll be back on that as
or two and then I'll be back on that as
well
well
the Isaac JY stuff does work um we're
the Isaac JY stuff does work um we're
going to get some baselines we're going
going to get some baselines we're going
to get some stuff trained and we're
to get some stuff trained and we're
going to see how that goes from
there want to finish this grid end I'm
there want to finish this grid end I'm
just not sure how I want to
just not sure how I want to
do I don't know how I want to do the
do I don't know how I want to do the
state
logic hey Spencer
man this is
irritating ironically if I had actually
irritating ironically if I had actually
made like a grill a grid cell object I
made like a grill a grid cell object I
wouldn't have this
wouldn't have this
problem
um but that's kind of no I'd still have
um but that's kind of no I'd still have
this
this
problem how was vacation went to the uh
problem how was vacation went to the uh
the galpagos
the galpagos
and it was more of an adventure than a
and it was more of an adventure than a
vacation to be honest I saw a bunch of
vacation to be honest I saw a bunch of
very cool stuff but it was not very
very cool stuff but it was not very
restful and uh the main thing I realized
restful and uh the main thing I realized
is I really can't be taking vacations
is I really can't be taking vacations
anymore with the amount of stuff going
anymore with the amount of stuff going
on with puffer cuz I'm kind of just
on with puffer cuz I'm kind of just
watching my inbox piling up with stuff
watching my inbox piling up with stuff
to do and uh it ends up you know I just
to do and uh it ends up you know I just
end up being more stressed than when I
end up being more stressed than when I
left
left
um so I'm probably not going to be
um so I'm probably not going to be
vacationing really for a couple of years
vacationing really for a couple of years
but that's fine
I want to get puffer off the ground
properly man I hate when I'm just
properly man I hate when I'm just
staring at stuff like this but uh
staring at stuff like this but uh
yeah I actually I was I was making like
yeah I actually I was I was making like
great Pace before I left if anything
great Pace before I left if anything
it's like getting off my schedule that
it's like getting off my schedule that
burns me out right I get good sleep I
burns me out right I get good sleep I
get good uh I have a good diet I have
get good uh I have a good diet I have
good exercise and all that goes out the
good exercise and all that goes out the
window when I go
window when I go
away almost done with
away almost done with
plg move conditions in BFS solver so far
plg move conditions in BFS solver so far
so good chimy logic and block pushing
so good chimy logic and block pushing
very nice and as soon as you finish that
very nice and as soon as you finish that
we will uh we'll start getting you on
we will uh we'll start getting you on
some some cool science side efforts most
some some cool science side efforts most
likely I'm doing a procedurally
likely I'm doing a procedurally
generated maze environment as
generated maze environment as
well this is just a 2d maze
environment it's almost done just have
environment it's almost done just have
to figure out how I just have to figure
to figure out how I just have to figure
out this last thing here which is with
out this last thing here which is with
loading and saving and stuff
now I really don't like losing my buffer
now I really don't like losing my buffer
checks
it's going to be creating a
set you have to run um well technically
set you have to run um well technically
it is O ofen but still it's kind of a
it is O ofen but still it's kind of a
chunky algorithm for an noen does a
chunky algorithm for an noen does a
bunch of checks
I wonder if it is fast enough to do in
I wonder if it is fast enough to do in
the training loop I would doubt it
okay I think I'm going to make save and
okay I think I'm going to make save and
load functions instead of messing with
load functions instead of messing with
the memory like this and it's just going
the memory like this and it's just going
to be two meeps instead of
to be two meeps instead of
one it's just going to be two meeps
one it's just going to be two meeps
instead of
instead of
one
um but then you need a freaking game
um but then you need a freaking game
State variable don't
you
e e
I think we're just going to do
this this is going to be the state
I put it down here
I want to pass this
I want to pass this
through there's a copy eye there
maybe I
do yeah hold
on you pass it as a
copy and this whole thing goes onto the
copy and this whole thing goes onto the
stack though
stack though
right but these Maps aren't huge maybe
right but these Maps aren't huge maybe
that's fine we'll try this
ah but this will be a pointer so this I
ah but this will be a pointer so this I
got to be careful here
got to be careful here
so this is a get date
so this is a get date
so you actually what you have to do
is this is kind of
is this is kind of
weird there's some pointer Shenanigans
here I'm getting very high variance that
here I'm getting very high variance that
that's possible depending on the
that's possible depending on the
environment that's very possible
yeah so the issue here is that this is
yeah so the issue here is that this is
it'll copy the pointer but then it'll be
it'll copy the pointer but then it'll be
pointing to the same data
what if we make you pass in a
state we'll just do you'll just you'll
state we'll just do you'll just you'll
pass in a
state all right then probably something
state all right then probably something
was
weird with is M like
weird with is M like
this and
then there we go so this is get State
then there we go so this is get State
and then set
and then set
State we'll uh we'll also give you state
State we'll uh we'll also give you state
Star
Star
State and we'll do n with height no
Agents
Set so n
Set so n
grid I don't know what's wrong with this
grid I don't know what's wrong with this
thing it doesn't see the pointer on this
thing it doesn't see the pointer on this
apparently probably because of the dots
apparently probably because of the dots
above it
there we
go so this is pretty easy get State set
go so this is pretty easy get State set
State like
this and the reset doesn't need to
be like
so now let me figure out out how I'm
so now let me figure out out how I'm
going to do this first and C I'd say
create maze
create maze
level so we'll just do
level so we'll just do
oops create maze
oops create maze
level
level
M difficulty is
0.85 and Seed
zero we also need to specify width and
zero we also need to specify width and
height
height
here I would
here I would
say um yeah we need to specify withd and
say um yeah we need to specify withd and
height you doing a random gen
for your plg or a known maze uh it is a
for your plg or a known maze uh it is a
growing tree
it's a kind of a nice algorithm because
it's a kind of a nice algorithm because
it lets you interpolate between
it lets you interpolate between
recursive backtracking and prims which
recursive backtracking and prims which
kind of gives you a difficulty slider in
kind of gives you a difficulty slider in
addition to
size pretty
cool for
search algorithms just
search algorithms just
working
working
yeah well Ser you don't have to do them
yeah well Ser you don't have to do them
very often right
what's your batch size and
stuff so let me tell you where you want
stuff so let me tell you where you want
to be for RL to make sense
to be for RL to make sense
okay for RL to make sense and not be
okay for RL to make sense and not be
incredibly
incredibly
painful this is where you want to
be all right you want to be at the point
where you can go to some dashboard like
where you can go to some dashboard like
this all right and then you can
this all right and then you can
just go to group by tags whoops Group
by can't click
there we go you want to basically just
there we go you want to basically just
be in a spot we can Group by
be in a spot we can Group by
tags you can go to your
plots and just like look at stuff like
plots and just like look at stuff like
this all right and then you want to know
this all right and then you want to know
if learning rate is screwy you go to
if learning rate is screwy you go to
learning rate and see where it's good
and you can you know you have multiple
and you can you know you have multiple
the
the
dashboards so like yeah this one's
dashboards so like yeah this one's
good and then you can just go look at
good and then you can just go look at
your learning rate and say here this is
your learning rate and say here this is
the stable region right here right this
the stable region right here right this
this is what you
want buffer length 10o per update is a
want buffer length 10o per update is a
ton
ton
look at the default prams we have for
look at the default prams we have for
some of our algorithms like this is
some of our algorithms like this is
where you want to get to and we've
where you want to get to and we've
already done most of the work for you in
already done most of the work for you in
puffer Leb so it's perfectly fine to
puffer Leb so it's perfectly fine to
implement your own algorithms and stuff
implement your own algorithms and stuff
but uh you know don't expect to use
but uh you know don't expect to use
those
those
implementations to get real work done
implementations to get real work done
because it takes months and months to
because it takes months and months to
get good
get good
implementations sometimes more than
implementations sometimes more than
that in the config files we got all the
that in the config files we got all the
DOA needs for different uh envir at
DOA needs for different uh envir at
least you can look at sweep
ranges I mean most of them are good some
ranges I mean most of them are good some
of them are outdated but most of them
of them are outdated but most of them
are
good yeah it's all in
good yeah it's all in
puffer all in
puffer all in
puffer actually I have not had restream
puffer actually I have not had restream
up this whole
up this whole
time go check
oh apparently there's seven people
oh apparently there's seven people
watching me sleepily code cool hi
everyone let's actually get this done in
everyone let's actually get this done in
that
that
case so we're going to do with will be
yeah let's try
this
off this is good so now we make the maze
off this is good so now we make the maze
level we'll try this out to see if this
level we'll try this out to see if this
is what we
want e
mini
batch no mini batch size is not buffer
batch no mini batch size is not buffer
length there is no buffer length in uh
length there is no buffer length in uh
in puffer lib because you don't always
in puffer lib because you don't always
collect the same number of steps from an
collect the same number of steps from an
environment so batch size is the total
environment so batch size is the total
number of steps you're going to collect
number of steps you're going to collect
from all the different environments that
from all the different environments that
you're simulating um per update and then
you're simulating um per update and then
mini batches how many of those samples
mini batches how many of those samples
you're going to use for each gradient
you're going to use for each gradient
step
yeah check the puffer implementation
yeah check the puffer implementation
right the puffer implementation will
right the puffer implementation will
clear stuff up it's based on clean RL
clear stuff up it's based on clean RL
which is the best implementation out
which is the best implementation out
there it's just uh it's just a little
there it's just uh it's just a little
faster by a little faster I mean like up
faster by a little faster I mean like up
to 30 times faster you
to 30 times faster you
know sometimes we do a little perf
know sometimes we do a little perf
optimization
passing oh this is because this needs to
passing oh this is because this needs to
be this needs to be a me copy not a me
set
set
yeah you know the uh the puffer ocean
yeah you know the uh the puffer ocean
has has a few cool environments in it we
has has a few cool environments in it we
could
say well that's not quite right it's
say well that's not quite right it's
almost right but not quite right
[Music]
so this just has to
be we do
this holy
this holy
okay um that's amusing
how I built this locally
right that's interesting how it's able
right that's interesting how it's able
to seg fault it should not be able to
to seg fault it should not be able to
seg
fault so this is now correct but the
fault so this is now correct but the
puffer's in the wrong spot
puffer's in the wrong spot
spawn agent
was very weird
was very weird
maybe it's rendering
weird where's rendering
that looks fine to
me why does the puffer go
me why does the puffer go
here why is this where the puffer is
zero X and Y
right still don't know where the bug is
right still don't know where the bug is
thank you very
much Max size
much Max size
set max size should be set
H it's weird that it spawns the puffer
there maybe we'll look in uh the
renderer I don't know if you can
renderer I don't know if you can
actually put a break point here
looks like you
looks like you
can okay so we
can okay so we
do y
do y
x uh it got set to 16 that's probably
x uh it got set to 16 that's probably
just something in the C file that I
just something in the C file that I
forgot to
remove yep there it is
though the create maze level should have
uh hang on great maze level should have
uh hang on great maze level should have
overwritten this
oh
stupid there we go so we'll have to
stupid there we go so we'll have to
figure out why it's occasionally seg
figure out why it's occasionally seg
faulting but here is a
faulting but here is a
maze this is where you go to solve the
maze this is where you go to solve the
maze stuff to handle
maze stuff to handle
resets this also requires quite precise
resets this also requires quite precise
control to not get
control to not get
stuck and then it dumps you into an
stuck and then it dumps you into an
empty
empty
environment
environment
um and then all we have to do is call
um and then all we have to do is call
get
State all we got to do is close so get
State all we got to do is close so get
step
Let's see we actually
Let's see we actually
get errors
now should put l lvm on here by default
to do add GDB and llvm to default puffer
tank okay now we actually get
something state
right
here does mem copy not work the way I
here does mem copy not work the way I
think it does what are the args on M
think it does what are the args on M
Copy it's probably a good thing that I
Copy it's probably a good thing that I
don't know this because it means I don't
don't know this because it means I don't
mem copy stuff around too often
two from
bytes no I'm
bytes no I'm
correct so why does this not
work Mac not have yeah you
work Mac not have yeah you
are can you not just stick a Docker
are can you not just stick a Docker
container on it do I need to build you a
container on it do I need to build you a
CPU Duff a CPU puffer tank cuz you
CPU Duff a CPU puffer tank cuz you
really are coding on hard mode for no
really are coding on hard mode for no
reason uh Adam
yeah Spencer like f sanitized is the
yeah Spencer like f sanitized is the
difference between liking C and hating
C like not having this was the reason
C like not having this was the reason
that I hated um my systems courses in
undergrad this is Linux
yeah you can do that but uh next time
yeah you can do that but uh next time
you get a seg fult remember that you
you get a seg fult remember that you
don't actually have to deal with
that why the heck is that not a
thing it should be a
thing if you find a compile build that
thing if you find a compile build that
uh runs it we can add
it so how would I
it so how would I
still because you can render through the
still because you can render through the
docker
duh I'm in a Docker now
this is a Docker you see the little
this is a Docker you see the little
puffer symbol puffer symbols the docker
prompt that's why he's there to tell you
prompt that's why he's there to tell you
that you're in the docker
I should be able to copy here right even
I should be able to copy here right even
those data on the stack
okay so yeah null argument passed
I
I
see and this is
see and this is
because I did not call
because I did not call
reset what did I not call a it
wait is is the M Copy signature
backwards I thought it's two and
backwards I thought it's two and
from this
from this
wrong two
from
from
two
two
wait n
wait n
State copy to
state but this should have an
address oh
dummy uh okay so this needs to be copied
dummy uh okay so this needs to be copied
to somewhere
so this make size of
State oh I just need an Alex State fun
State oh I just need an Alex State fun
okay this is me being
sleepy like this
there we
there we
go that's super basic
uh you need Max size
this there we go
I really don't need
I really don't need
the allocate as much as I need the
the allocate as much as I need the
init you state
state state like this
maybe hold on let me read
maybe hold on let me read
that P is doing better it's officially
faster any of the common architectures
faster any of the common architectures
that I use should work if you have like
that I use should work if you have like
a five layer feed for net is probably
a five layer feed for net is probably
not going to
not going to
work I can look at it if you
need e
fair
enough I would like to finish this after
all bro thanks CB to be
sass are we getting freaking invaded by
sass are we getting freaking invaded by
Twitter
Bots is this the freaking creator of the
Bots is this the freaking creator of the
coin still trying to convince me to do
coin still trying to convince me to do
this with Bots like just
this with Bots like just
stop all right
stop no then why are you doing this the
stop no then why are you doing this the
original coin was a
scam that wasn't me
scam that wasn't me
that's somebody obviously impersonating
me well obviously I'm an MIT PhD what do
me well obviously I'm an MIT PhD what do
you
you
expect your coin lost me 10K I posted as
expect your coin lost me 10K I posted as
soon as I saw it that uh it wasn't
me yeah this is definitely
me yeah this is definitely
Bots lovely
okay whoever you are running this net do
okay whoever you are running this net do
you seriously have nothing better to
do like piss off I'm trying to build
do like piss off I'm trying to build
some cool stuff
here yeah it's just 10 Twitter accounts
here yeah it's just 10 Twitter accounts
that happen to join at the same
time
mhm you either multi clien or whatever
okay this works but then it doesn't
okay this works but then it doesn't
reset correctly
this
done okay dun doesn't reset
correctly fix
correctly fix
that I'm
DS res set Rewards
ah whatever man
WS I should reset
DS
rewards and then episode return should
rewards and then episode return should
get reset on its own
right oh this is silly this is just a
right oh this is silly this is just a
placeholder for uh proper log struct
placeholder for uh proper log struct
that's
that's
fine let's see if this gets it to reset
fine let's see if this gets it to reset
correctly
very
nice okay so that
nice okay so that
works so now we have a basic PCG maze
environment and it has to render it full
environment and it has to render it full
size like that as well because the mazes
size like that as well because the mazes
can vary in size just fine
uh and let me see if I can
load 10 to
three so 10 EPO is crazy high because

usually it's unstable if somehow you're
usually it's unstable if somehow you're
keeping it stable for those 10 Epoch
keeping it stable for those 10 Epoch
then yes it will increase sample
then yes it will increase sample
efficiency

um it should not be approximately equal
um it should not be approximately equal
the same time though because if you have
the same time though because if you have
your system correctly
your system correctly
tuned then you should be able to get new
tuned then you should be able to get new
samples uh for free instead of getting
samples uh for free instead of getting
old samples so you can train more on new
old samples so you can train more on new
data instead of on old data which is how
data instead of on old data which is how
we have it in puffer because the
we have it in puffer because the
environments are so fast
it's probably just poorly optimized is
it's probably just poorly optimized is
all I mean on any like little simple end
all I mean on any like little simple end
you should be pushing hundreds of
you should be pushing hundreds of
thousands of steps per second
thousands of steps per second
you'll find that things just magically
you'll find that things just magically
start working when you have that
seg falter OS being
weird look at
this
this
interesting seems like this only one
interesting seems like this only one
locked door I think in this setup right
locked door I think in this setup right
yeah these are there's only one locked
yeah these are there's only one locked
door this is the

interesting so I must have broken
something yeah you just have your pram

I look at the way we do stuff on puffer

man you use batch size like a thousand
man you use batch size like a thousand

got to get dinner soon now let me fix

point the goal for the year financially
point the goal for the year financially
is to scale puffer to uh 1 million AR
is to scale puffer to uh 1 million AR
which I think is going to be very
which I think is going to be very
possible with what I'm doing
now it takes a few more
now it takes a few more
clients there we go so um I guess guess
clients there we go so um I guess guess
all these other doors are open which
all these other doors are open which
yeah they're all green so it's literally
yeah they're all green so it's literally
there is just one locked door in this
there is just one locked door in this
environment it's just the mini locked

in and you go like
in and you go like
this added you on YouTube thank
you all the demos are on puffer doai if
you all the demos are on puffer doai if
you're interested in in them they're uh
you're interested in in them they're uh
they're pretty fun they're like basic
they're pretty fun they're like basic
little games some of them not so basic
little games some of them not so basic
little games but they all run at like a
little games but they all run at like a
million steps per second 10,000 times
million steps per second 10,000 times
real time when we train AI on them so I
real time when we train AI on them so I
mean stuff like this now we have we can
mean stuff like this now we have we can
do stuff like train buff on, 1500 years
do stuff like train buff on, 1500 years
worth of games on one
GPU and it's all open
GPU and it's all open
source and most of the code is now
source and most of the code is now
contributed by community members so it's
contributed by community members so it's
a fun project and it's a great way to
a fun project and it's a great way to
advance this area of science because all
advance this area of science because all
the research these days seems to require
the research these days seems to require
a $100 million
cluster if I were purely motivated by

money I wouldn't be doing this this is
money I wouldn't be doing this this is
science first money second there will be
science first money second there will be
money there will be return on this
money there will be return on this
but this is the primary goal of this
but this is the primary goal of this
project is to revolutionize
project is to revolutionize
reinforcement
reinforcement
learning and we're well on our
way I mean I are you kidding me of
way I mean I are you kidding me of
course I wouldn't be doing this right
course I wouldn't be doing this right
there's so many other areas of AI that
there's so many other areas of AI that
are so much easier you kidding me so
are so much easier you kidding me so
much easier to just like
I mean this is fun too
right but yeah I mean we've shipped
right but yeah I mean we've shipped
puffer is now close to like 30,000 lines
puffer is now close to like 30,000 lines
of uh of ship code most of which is SE
of uh of ship code most of which is SE
environments
fixes it's not fun outside of
fixes it's not fun outside of
puffer took me very many years to figure
puffer took me very many years to figure
out how to make it not horrible and it's
out how to make it not horrible and it's
going to get much better from
here do you know if something similar
here do you know if something similar
exists for chatting with
customers I mean you mean like the way
customers I mean you mean like the way
that companies have been replacing their
that companies have been replacing their
support with chat
support with chat

um this Tech wouldn't be for that I mean
um this Tech wouldn't be for that I mean
this Tech is used on top of language
this Tech is used on top of language
models to improve them um but in the way
models to improve them um but in the way
that I'm using it now it's not for that
that I'm using it now it's not for that
um this is mostly going to be used in
um this is mostly going to be used in
robotics various industrial processes
robotics various industrial processes
across a ton of different fields and
across a ton of different fields and
various miscellaneous
tasks because this is not this is not RL
tasks because this is not this is not RL
on language models this is RL tabularasa
on language models this is RL tabularasa
from scratch with much smaller models on
from scratch with much smaller models on
mostly game environments but all other
mostly game environments but all other
types of Sims as well that we're
types of Sims as well that we're
building um you know stuff like this we
building um you know stuff like this we
got like miniature version of of DOTA
got like miniature version of of DOTA
here we've got like some classic arcade
here we've got like some classic arcade
tasks like pong and breakout and
tasks like pong and breakout and
stuff um but the the cool thing about
stuff um but the the cool thing about
this is that you can actually do this
this is that you can actually do this
research at a reasonable scale uh we can
research at a reasonable scale uh we can
chew through as much data as all of GPD
chew through as much data as all of GPD
4 and about one GPU with some of these
4 and about one GPU with some of these
small little models and we can actually
small little models and we can actually
train agents capable of solving game
train agents capable of solving game
environments and solving various useful
environments and solving various useful
things like that industrial process yeah
things like that industrial process yeah
I think that that's going to be one of
I think that that's going to be one of
the main areas of course it's going to
the main areas of course it's going to
have to get a little bit more stable and
have to get a little bit more stable and
a little bit more out of the box first
a little bit more out of the box first
so generally we're starting with tasks
so generally we're starting with tasks
that are a lot more visually
that are a lot more visually
interpretable because there's a lot of
interpretable because there's a lot of
back and forth
back and forth
debugging but as it gets more stable
debugging but as it gets more stable
we're going to move into that AI into my
we're going to move into that AI into my
simulation game uh if you're thinking
simulation game uh if you're thinking
like enemy AI npca I and so on yes this
like enemy AI npca I and so on yes this
is the tech that you would use for that
is the tech that you would use for that
now mind you it's still pretty like
now mind you it's still pretty like
pretty new tech and it still requires a
pretty new tech and it still requires a
fair bit of experience to get working on
fair bit of experience to get working on
any new problem uh we're currently
any new problem uh we're currently
trying to make it substantially easier
trying to make it substantially easier
right that's what I'm doing with puffer
right that's what I'm doing with puffer
Li make it easier make it better make it
Li make it easier make it better make it
faster all of that um and it is rapidly
faster all of that um and it is rapidly
getting better but yes this is the tech
getting better but yes this is the tech
that you would use for
that so gaming will be you know one
that so gaming will be you know one
potential uh or one pretty large
potential uh or one pretty large
application area
I've chatted with a few gaming companies
I've chatted with a few gaming companies
we don't have any contracts in that area
we don't have any contracts in that area
just yet but uh hey puffer still
just yet but uh hey puffer still
relatively new and it takes uh it takes
relatively new and it takes uh it takes
a while to build up a nice client
base okay I think I'm done with this for
base okay I think I'm done with this for
to now I think the only thing that I
to now I think the only thing that I
have to
have to
do the only thing that I have to do on
do the only thing that I have to do on
this now is I have to get the binding to
this now is I have to get the binding to
scyon
scyon
um initially it's probably just going to
um initially it's probably just going to
be a very simple binding and then we're
be a very simple binding and then we're
going to add in curriculum learning type
going to add in curriculum learning type
features so that you can uh reset the
features so that you can uh reset the
map to a specific maze level depending
map to a specific maze level depending
on its difficulty based on uh how well
on its difficulty based on uh how well
you've been doing on that previously
you've been doing on that previously
so that'll be
so that'll be
interesting uh but yeah I'm going to
interesting uh but yeah I'm going to
break for dinner I'll probably be back
break for dinner I'll probably be back
on afterwards depending on how long that
on afterwards depending on how long that
takes and see if I can knock out like an
takes and see if I can knock out like an
extra hour or so might not depends I got
extra hour or so might not depends I got
to look at uh what stuff I got a prep
to look at uh what stuff I got a prep
for tomorrow but probably so I'd like to
for tomorrow but probably so I'd like to
finish this um so thanks for tuning in
finish this um so thanks for tuning in

with development most of this is led by

pick up the rest pretty quick and if you
pick up the rest pretty quick and if you
want more content than that we have
want more content than that we have

find anywhere else think you'll do well
with Riot games got a meeting on the

we've got a ton of people in the Discord
we've got a ton of people in the Discord
all building cool stuff so

Kind: captions
Language: en
we are
we are
live
um I am back there's a ludicrous amount
um I am back there's a ludicrous amount
of stuff stacked up to
of stuff stacked up to
fix I'm going to figure out what the
fix I'm going to figure out what the
heck needs fixing and just start going
heck needs fixing and just start going
through a bunch of stuff
Dynamic the
heck okay this is
weird yeah so there needs to be some
weird yeah so there needs to be some
change
change
there um
where did this go
oh here it is it's just a thread here
so e
okay got that I believe we have some
okay got that I believe we have some
support stuff on e3b to deal with
next yeah okay so there's something
next yeah okay so there's something
weird with e3b let me figure this out
oops this here
I guess the first thing to do is just
I guess the first thing to do is just
going to be
let's see if this uh how this
increases so we'll see if this uh
increases so we'll see if this uh
continues to increase or
not nope
consistent so there's no memory
leak let me go see what uh what version
leak let me go see what uh what version
they currently have that I
they currently have that I
pr yeah this is not no memory leak in my
pr yeah this is not no memory leak in my
version and I push
version and I push
this yeah these are just anyes this is
this yeah these are just anyes this is
fine
oh wait I didn't push this
oh wait I didn't push this
[ __ ] okay I didn't push this
um how far through this did I
get I thought I sent them a PR
did I just not send them a
PR I don't know
PR I don't know
man last week was like stupid
busy for
and then I got to figure out the Run
and then I got to figure out the Run
command for this
let me find the freaking command
I miss run
oops no not like
that I think it was just
runer for
okay so now we can
do we can do this and
see yeah there we
see yeah there we
go uh is this we'll just have to watch
go uh is this we'll just have to watch
this for a little bit to see if there's
this for a little bit to see if there's
any memory issue for
okay so this is I forgot the hardware
flag so we'll see if this one
uh if this one is
worse see how much this uses
look stable to
me
me
oops
oops
[Music]
Dam dam is fine
and memory is it
stable yeah that looks stable
oh I just noticed is there
literally H there's a screenshot on the
literally H there's a screenshot on the
terminal that's funny
okay so that is pushed
yeah that's all separate we don't care
yeah that's all separate we don't care
with
that solid okay so this is
that solid okay so this is
done
um add a PR that fix I just
made
HFF can't merge
why is
this got my compute cluster back good
this got my compute cluster back good
for you ours is

this is the nicest way to just have your

worry about it
it I say this to somebody who wrote
it I say this to somebody who wrote
python for 10 years and resisted this
python for 10 years and resisted this
very
strongly did this thing work
yes this did
yes this did
work me make sure it still
runs and that there is no uh memory
leak yeah Ryan that's not I swapped the

we're getting uh our Dev boxes now cuz
we're getting uh our Dev boxes now cuz
we've got our new ones very dialed
in they're a little pricey but they're

quite
nice I mean not even really all that

grand out of the box so
okay this
works I believe this works I'll let it
works I believe this works I'll let it
run a little
longer oh shoot this was like compiling

policies yeah so uh it seems
policies yeah so uh it seems
like if you were to run experiments on
like if you were to run experiments on
every core uh for some of the simpler
every core uh for some of the simpler
environments it would be faster than
environments it would be faster than
just running one experiment on the
just running one experiment on the
GPU um but the individual experiments
GPU um but the individual experiments
would be about four or five times
would be about four or five times
slower um also we want to be able to run
slower um also we want to be able to run
slightly larger policies so it's very
slightly larger policies so it's very
bad to just invest in CPU only infra um
bad to just invest in CPU only infra um
because we're not going to be running
because we're not going to be running
100K policies for f for right we will'll
100K policies for f for right we will'll
be running like million parameter
be running like million parameter
policies or whatnot
policies or whatnot
um I don't think it's horribly cheaper
um I don't think it's horribly cheaper
either cu the GPU is adding about
either cu the GPU is adding about
2500 to the price of the machine um like
2500 to the price of the machine um like
there's still the high-end
there's still the high-end
CPU uh and the RAM and everything like I
CPU uh and the RAM and everything like I
guess you down the power supply bit
but we probably could get some decent
but we probably could get some decent
CPU boxes for like 2500 instead of 5,500
CPU boxes for like 2500 instead of 5,500
yeah um it's a really bad direction to

bet on scalability wise
bet on scalability wise
though 4 to 5x yeah we see um I mean
though 4 to 5x yeah we see um I mean
that's only for the really small
that's only for the really small
policies as well you get like 100k

another model so if you have like
general purpose tokenizing and you train
general purpose tokenizing and you train
your LMS on everything then you can just
your LMS on everything then you can just
do that um but like we can currently
do that um but like we can currently
train on about as much data as all of
train on about as much data as all of
gp4 for instance on one
gp4 for instance on one
GPU so there's just like a massive
GPU so there's just like a massive
difference in data scale and RL scales
difference in data scale and RL scales
really well with data so that we're
really well with data so that we're
going to have to square that at some
going to have to square that at some
point and I definitely think that
point and I definitely think that
language models are abs like an
language models are abs like an
absolutely terrible domain for like
absolutely terrible domain for like
figuring out what works in RL and what

want to show off my new uh some of the
want to show off my new uh some of the

that's fine we'll fix that real

this think
this think
we fix the resets
we fix the resets
first we make a couple Standalone
first we make a couple Standalone
functions for that for different types
functions for that for different types
of tasks we bind the scon and we call a
of tasks we bind the scon and we call a
day
have to do observation function though
have to do observation function though
that's pretty
easy right so the other thing was was
easy right so the other thing was was
caching this
let us
initially maybe I should just initially
initially maybe I should just initially
have it be the maze task and then add
have it be the maze task and then add
stuff in
stuff in
after um
you kind of
need it's a little tricky now I'm
need it's a little tricky now I'm
thinking about it how we're going to do
thinking about it how we're going to do
the resets and
stuff set this one thing before I start
stuff set this one thing before I start
cuz I just remember
cuz I just remember
there's a a meeting I have set that I
there's a a meeting I have set that I
need to set a reminder for
perfect do you believe in the rewards
perfect do you believe in the rewards
enough enough
hypothesis I'm I mean it doesn't really
hypothesis I'm I mean it doesn't really
tell you anything on its own right
tell you anything on its own right
because if you have like an ideal reward
because if you have like an ideal reward
signal is just imitating an ideal is
signal is just imitating an ideal is
imitating a perfect policy
imitating a perfect policy
right which is not what we actually
right which is not what we actually
usually mean by that um so basically
usually mean by that um so basically
most of the stuff that we do in RL is to
most of the stuff that we do in RL is to
get around the fact that we almost never
get around the fact that we almost never
have a perfect reward signal like this
have a perfect reward signal like this
so in some sense yes but you never have
so in some sense yes but you never have
the perfect signal so you kind of have
the perfect signal so you kind of have
to do some extra things
to do some extra things
um yeah something like
that I'm trying to think if there's a
that I'm trying to think if there's a
way
when you call in in
when you call in in
it intelligence
about optimizing a
about optimizing a
fixed well the thing is it depends how
fixed well the thing is it depends how
you define the reward function right
you define the reward function right
because if the function can be
because if the function can be
anything right
anything right
then it's like okay yeah technically you
then it's like okay yeah technically you
could probably cast anything like
could probably cast anything like
that it's like an intentionally poorly
that it's like an intentionally poorly
specified
specified
statement right it's not
statement right it's not
specified it's a too vague of a
specified it's a too vague of a
statement to really make any conclusion
statement to really make any conclusion
about like
that e
I'm trying to think how I want to do
this what do you actually have to do to
this what do you actually have to do to
reset the environment at the moment you
reset the environment at the moment you
just respawn the
just respawn the
agent and remake the Border that's kind
agent and remake the Border that's kind
of
weird oh but your m setting to zero the
weird oh but your m setting to zero the
yeah okay that's very
yeah okay that's very
weird it's probably yeah it's because of
weird it's probably yeah it's because of
the uh the various
entities AI
entities AI
controlled I highly doubt
that I mean in Atari is a very limited
that I mean in Atari is a very limited
and kind of crappy Benchmark frankly
okay this reset function is not very
good you should honestly have to reset
good you should honestly have to reset
it
with yeah you should just the reset
with yeah you should just the reset
should just be a mem
should just be a mem
copy that's what this should be
these things end up mattering a lot
these things end up mattering a lot
because otherwise I like I don't want to
because otherwise I like I don't want to
spend the next three hours writing a
spend the next three hours writing a
bunch of useless
bunch of useless
code
code
um I think probably all I have to do
um I think probably all I have to do
is so reset does have to set Tick an
is so reset does have to set Tick an
episode Return To Zero and stuff like
episode Return To Zero and stuff like
this but for this side I think this just
goes this goes into a
net we haven't loaded the level though
maybe it's a load level
maybe it's a load level
function where does reward come from and
function where does reward come from and
how yeah
it's I mean we're
it's I mean we're
already I'm under no you know false
already I'm under no you know false
Impressions that the M's that we have
Impressions that the M's that we have
are complex enough either right the
are complex enough either right the
thing is though they are a lot better
thing is though they are a lot better
than what's out there at at the moment
than what's out there at at the moment
and uh they're going to help us do you
and uh they're going to help us do you
know a whole new generation of RL
know a whole new generation of RL
research and then if you think second
research and then if you think second
order right maybe that's enough to get
order right maybe that's enough to get
people really interested in RL not just
people really interested in RL not just
for llms and maybe we make RL stable and
for llms and maybe we make RL stable and
consistent enough for a bunch of
consistent enough for a bunch of
Industries to pick it up so that you
Industries to pick it up so that you
know puffer can get a good chunk of
know puffer can get a good chunk of
Revenue off of that and we can even you
Revenue off of that and we can even you
know start scaling more research so you
know start scaling more research so you
know we're kind of the way I have this
know we're kind of the way I have this
set
set
up um
up um
it's not because what you see is the end
it's not because what you see is the end
plan the stuff that you see is stuff I'm
plan the stuff that you see is stuff I'm
very proud of but it's not the end
very proud of but it's not the end
plan I mean stuff like this though
plan I mean stuff like this though
really shows you the potential I really
really shows you the potential I really
like neural MMOs and environment it's
like neural MMOs and environment it's
not even a full MMO though right it has
not even a full MMO though right it has
like an economy system it's got fighting
like an economy system it's got fighting
it's got some leveling but it's not a
it's got some leveling but it's not a
full
full
MMO and a full MMO probably isn't enough
MMO and a full MMO probably isn't enough
either but it's probably two generations
either but it's probably two generations
of progress not just one
now all we got to do is get the
now all we got to do is get the
generational progress time down to about
generational progress time down to about
a year and we'll be
good okay I don't like how this is done
good okay I don't like how this is done
either I think it's got to be like load
either I think it's got to be like load
level or some shenanigans
I don't know why this is
I don't know why this is
difficult really shouldn't be
I mean I'm not 100%
I mean I'm not 100%
today but still
a Kerbal end for peffer is that kfp
yeah I mean hey anybody who wants to
yeah I mean hey anybody who wants to
contribute n can do it right we have
contribute n can do it right we have
people working in all sorts of cool
people working in all sorts of cool
environment
projects this one here is somewhat
projects this one here is somewhat
urgent so I'm trying to Fig figure this
out okay maybe I'll just think through
out okay maybe I'll just think through
this out loud cuz the thing is I'm just
this out loud cuz the thing is I'm just
pretty tired still from uh travel was
pretty tired still from uh travel was
traveling all day yesterday um so let me
traveling all day yesterday um so let me
see if I can this is really basic but um
see if I can this is really basic but um
what I want to do is I want to basically
what I want to do is I want to basically
let you create level specs and then
let you create level specs and then
resetting to that level should just be a
resetting to that level should just be a
single mem copy which should be very
single mem copy which should be very
fast because actually generating the
fast because actually generating the
levels is slow but I can't have this be
levels is slow but I can't have this be
in the initialization because I want you
in the initialization because I want you
to basically be able to create a bunch
to basically be able to create a bunch
of levels outside of this and then uh
of levels outside of this and then uh
load them
load them
in
so what I need to do is have a
so what I need to do is have a
standalone level load
function uh which I already have
function uh which I already have
for these
for these
mazes and
then you just call that function a
bunch now the tricky thing here is that
bunch now the tricky thing here is that
you also have to specify like goal
you also have to specify like goal
position and agent position and
position and agent position and
such
um and that is not
yeah that's not defined by the
yeah that's not defined by the
environment which is the
problem okay so yeah that is the issue
problem okay so yeah that is the issue
is that you also have the agent
is that you also have the agent
position uh everything else is kind of
fine yeah literally everything else is
fine so I guess for now you can just
fine so I guess for now you can just
pass in the agent position directly
when you do load
when you do load
level but that's does that give you your
spec no that will give you your
spec so we'll just make it'll be a fair
spec so we'll just make it'll be a fair
bit simpler than
this so we'll just do void load
level and then this will take some
level and then this will take some
properties
I could also just allocate can I
I could also just allocate can I
allocate the memory
allocate the memory
contiguously I think technically I can I
contiguously I think technically I can I
could just allocate the memory
could just allocate the memory
continuously and copy the whole
continuously and copy the whole
environment
environment
state that would be kind of
cool so set State and get State instead
cool so set State and get State instead
of doing doing
this I don't know if that's better or
this I don't know if that's better or
not
not
howy
welcome I am sleepily trying to fix very
welcome I am sleepily trying to fix very
simple environment
problems it's too late for coffee as
well man you know
well man you know
the the freaking pneumonia makes
the the freaking pneumonia makes
everything so much worse because
I mean here look at this
I mean here look at this
mess where is
this come
on is this from
on is this from
today why is this not ever sync anything
I don't know why this didn't synchronize
I don't know why this didn't synchronize
I was going to show but basically it's
I was going to show but basically it's
like I have to train at 185 heart rate
like I have to train at 185 heart rate
to get anything done
yeah so the options here right are you
yeah so the options here right are you
try to come up
try to come up
with static
representation I mean how's this going
representation I mean how's this going
to work even if you just have it like
to work even if you just have it like
set the state of the grid and get the
set the state of the grid and get the
state of the
Grid it's like
Grid it's like
you still have to come up with a way to
you still have to come up with a way to
set the agents
right what's happening in Dev chat
okay so the two options you come up with
okay so the two options you come up with
a static representation you just set
a static representation you just set
make set State method
the only things you really need to do
the only things you really need to do
are
set I think it would actually be
set I think it would actually be
faster to just have set and get State
faster to just have set and get State
functions and you could probably use
functions and you could probably use
those for other stuff as
well so let's instead of making this be
well so let's instead of making this be
the whole level let's just
do right so we do this
right okay so that spawns the a
right okay so that spawns the a
agent at X and
agent at X and
Y spawn X
so we've got this generate
maze which I
like then we'll do create maze level
under
here create
here create
[Music]
maze learning
maze learning
rate 0.01 is very high for
rate 0.01 is very high for
po they don't need to they like yes the
po they don't need to they like yes the
hyper parameters are going to be
hyper parameters are going to be
different but that is a very large
different but that is a very large
difference like 01 is very high for po
look e
difficulty probably like this
not bad
spawn this one
here he minus two
okay so that's not
bad so this creates a maze
level and similarly we should be able to
level and similarly we should be able to
have the
um we should be able to have the locked
um we should be able to have the locked
room level right
yeah so this is what we had for locked
yeah so this is what we had for locked
room here
so here's your locked room preset
and then we'll make a create locked room
and then we'll make a create locked room
level
doesn't need seed nothing
random so we start by generating the
room and then we make the Border
and then the agent gets
spawned we'll leave this for
now this
this
19 I think this kind of does everything
19 I think this kind of does everything
except yeah this kind of does everything
except yeah this kind of does everything
for you to be
for you to be
honest but I think that we don't even
honest but I think that we don't even
need this is just
need this is just
redundant we'll figure out how to do
redundant we'll figure out how to do
this cleaner but this should be good for
now and then all we need to do is fix
now and then all we need to do is fix
the way states are allocated so let's do
the way states are allocated so let's do
that uh I got to go find the trick for
that uh I got to go find the trick for
that cuz there's a little trick
um that might be an issue
here
State can I do this in a
State can I do this in a
way let me see
so the problem is that there are
so the problem is that there are
observations actions rewards and DS in
observations actions rewards and DS in
here
this is also wait this is a pointer
okay so the set State thing is not going
okay so the set State thing is not going
to work exactly the way I was hoping it
to work exactly the way I was hoping it
would
work because this thing
contains pointers to
memory wait maybe that doesn't matter
wait yeah that doesn't matter because I
wait yeah that doesn't matter because I
can still allocate them in the same
can still allocate them in the same
memory
memory
right yes I
can do you use cloud Compu or have an
can do you use cloud Compu or have an
Nvidia we use the puffer cluster
Nvidia we use the puffer cluster
which uh we're currently fixing some

quite substantially in the next few
quite substantially in the next few
months we're going to get 40 boxes

and then we will be RL
Powerhouse oh wait I think I totally can
Powerhouse oh wait I think I totally can

the only thing I got to be careful about
the only thing I got to be careful about
is struct
packing personal projects no it's it's

for RL having a cluster is better um

because you don't want to be renting

very poorly speced for
very poorly speced for
RL so RL can be done relatively cost

Hardware that said we got completely

screwed by uh all the Intel hardware
screwed by uh all the Intel hardware
issues so our new boxes will be AMD and

we will no longer have those problems
we will no longer have those problems
but yeah we've had a lot of hardware
but yeah we've had a lot of hardware
issues figuring out how to do everything
and also puffer is uh a bit more than a

it still works

surprisingly I mean I bought that thing

in undergrad it still works so that's

made was in my undergrad I bought two

1080 TI and stuck them in a a personal
1080 TI and stuck them in a a personal

first paper
first paper
published ran all my experiments on
published ran all my experiments on
those two
cards yeah people were fighting over you

know cluster time on their really

outdated cards and I was like all right
I'm not getting public I'm not getting

any research done on these I'm just
any research done on these I'm just
going to make my own like build my own
going to make my own like build my own
machine for
this
d8s yeah we'll see
I mean we're going to have
I mean we're going to have
um we're going to have some very nice
um we're going to have some very nice
Hardware soon the first test machine
Hardware soon the first test machine
should hopefully come in in a few weeks
should hopefully come in in a few weeks
first 5090 test
first 5090 test
machine and then uh we'll be ordering
machine and then uh we'll be ordering
you know an additional 40 machines
I would love to order an additional 41
I would love to order an additional 41
machine so I have a spare as a gaming
machine so I have a spare as a gaming
desktop but
desktop but
uh I it's probably better that I don't
uh I it's probably better that I don't
have
that I'm kind of just staring at this
that I'm kind of just staring at this
thing thinking about how I want to do it
doesn't flop like 40 40 series was great
I don't know what you're on about like
I don't know what you're on about like
the 40 series was
great I mean the only Hardware
great I mean the only Hardware
complaints I have lately are just the
complaints I have lately are just the
Intel chips
the perf was pretty solid for uh thought
the perf was pretty solid for uh thought
the perf was pretty darn solid I mean
the perf was pretty darn solid I mean
maybe the perf per dollar or something
maybe the perf per dollar or something
wasn't but it was a pretty substantial
wasn't but it was a pretty substantial
boost over the 309s
just ordered AMD
just ordered AMD
chip 40 series nor budget for 50 Series
chip 40 series nor budget for 50 Series
yeah 40 series are good AMD chip is good
yeah 40 series are good AMD chip is good
we use a 9950 axis for our RL builds
well we I got one box with those and uh
well we I got one box with those and uh
the new ones will have those stupid inal
UPS manag to get 59 90s today I ordered
UPS manag to get 59 90s today I ordered
like last week I ordered a
like last week I ordered a
5090 um I'm not ordering them direct
5090 um I'm not ordering them direct
from Nvidia single cards that's a mess I
from Nvidia single cards that's a mess I
am ordering full built
am ordering full built
machines from uh you know from uh from
machines from uh you know from uh from
main gear
I should probably just do it already
I should probably just do it already
stop looking at it just do it
stop looking at it just do it
so this goes here this goes here Max
so this goes here this goes here Max
size width
size width
height this goes down
here yeah so this is it with height n
agents can actually put this here
90 well it's more so that the uh the
90 well it's more so that the uh the
other chips are crazy
overpriced why are you using bandwidth
overpriced why are you using bandwidth
as why are you using
as why are you using
bandwidth what why is bandwidth your
bandwidth what why is bandwidth your
performance met
it's around 2300 ret no it's 2,000 is
it's around 2300 ret no it's 2,000 is
what it was advertised
as it's 2,300 if they put it in a box
as it's 2,300 if they put it in a box
for you
that looks like a very large
Improvement yeah except then there's the
Improvement yeah except then there's the
tensor core jump but then the thing is
tensor core jump but then the thing is
the tensor the tensor cores are also the
the tensor the tensor cores are also the
next generation of tensor cores so
next generation of tensor cores so
they're hard to compare one to
one for
how did I do this
before could do an
before could do an
allocator I could just
do yeah but you don't compare per watt
do yeah but you don't compare per watt
because you can't buy a better
because you can't buy a better
card so it's the price of the card goes
card so it's the price of the card goes
up by a few hundred bucks but then the
up by a few hundred bucks but then the
price of your whole box goes up by that
price of your whole box goes up by that
as well if you're GPU
bound well yeah the 2000 is actually
bound well yeah the 2000 is actually
very reasonable it's the uh the data
very reasonable it's the uh the data
center chips that aren't they're
center chips that aren't they're
literally they're at like 93% profit
literally they're at like 93% profit
margin there I mean they're practically
margin there I mean they're practically
the US Mint with their profit margin
I thought the founders Edition was
2K yeah Founders Edition
is oh
is oh
where's the
uh why do these look so [ __ ]
uh why do these look so [ __ ]
actually they had like a
actually they had like a
nice yeah what where do you buy this one
nice yeah what where do you buy this one
right
here this is the original chip right why
here this is the original chip right why
like they got all these uh these ones
like they got all these uh these ones
with separate fans on
them do they not sell the chip that the
them do they not sell the chip that the
freaking picture
is oh they got 80s
oh yeah AMD is just completely lost at
oh yeah AMD is just completely lost at
this
point I mean actually for gaming cards I
point I mean actually for gaming cards I
think that they just make lower end
think that they just make lower end
gaming cards for the most
gaming cards for the most
part is all they do on that front
40 s's well I didn't even know that they
40 s's well I didn't even know that they
made those
man I think that they're busy using
man I think that they're busy using
their silicon producing facilities for
their silicon producing facilities for
uh data center chips that are 10x the
price would be my guess
okay where's the clever
thing right here right
that's
weird I don't like it doesn't make sense
weird I don't like it doesn't make sense
to me why they would do
to me why they would do
that AMD software
that AMD software
guy well yeah I don't know what they're
guy well yeah I don't know what they're
doing they're just like they should have
doing they're just like they should have
just taken that offer the first time I
just taken that offer the first time I
don't know what's wrong with
them I think though honestly I think
them I think though honestly I think
that they just want to build I think
that they just want to build I think
they just want to make their CPUs and
they just want to make their CPUs and
not risk trying to compete with Nvidia
not risk trying to compete with Nvidia
at all I think that they just think that
at all I think that they just think that
they lose so they're not going to bother
they lose so they're not going to bother
they're just going to keep making CPUs
they're just going to keep making CPUs
and honestly like they kind of won the
and honestly like they kind of won the
CPU Market um I'd say with the latest
CPU Market um I'd say with the latest
Intel screw up I mean I've used Intel
Intel screw up I mean I've used Intel
chips exclusively for 15 years I'm never
chips exclusively for 15 years I'm never
buying another Intel
chip like they would have to double
chip like they would have to double
amd's performance now for me to even
amd's performance now for me to even
look at
look at
them that's how badly they screwed
up m i mean their chips they're making
up m i mean their chips they're making
good money on their chips though like
good money on their chips though like
they um the high-end CPUs right and
they um the high-end CPUs right and
workstations they got their thread
workstations they got their thread
rippers they've got pretty nice chips
rippers they've got pretty nice chips
for
for the gpus I mean you saw what Intel
for the gpus I mean you saw what Intel
did with their recent chips right like
did with their recent chips right like
nobody in their right mind should be
nobody in their right mind should be
buying Intel
buying Intel
CPUs um and anytime soon at least uh
CPUs um and anytime soon at least uh
desktop grade chips
that's
funny this does have the side effect
funny this does have the side effect
that I will not be able to
that I will not be able to
see um out of memory bound
see um out of memory bound
errors which is moderately
annoying working on similar RL beginner
annoying working on similar RL beginner
though using browser use GitHub

you're dealing with
text text as a medium is hard to learn
text text as a medium is hard to learn
tabul rasa from scratch
well I'm personally going to Hope us

good hey man are you working on
good hey man are you working on
gym right on gym this is puffer
gym right on gym this is puffer
lib
lib
um we're currently working on a
um we're currently working on a
procedurally generated maze
procedurally generated maze
environment not sure if you're familiar
environment not sure if you're familiar
with some of the other stuff around here
with some of the other stuff around here
but our environments are good thousand
but our environments are good thousand
times faster than anything you're going
times faster than anything you're going
to find in
gy these are all playable online as
gy these are all playable online as
well with RL agents in the
browser so we're making a procedurally
browser so we're making a procedurally
generated maze environment for RL though
generated maze environment for RL though
we're doing so rather slowly I got back
we're doing so rather slowly I got back
from vacation yesterday I'm still pretty
from vacation yesterday I'm still pretty
tired from traveling recent unit tree
tired from traveling recent unit tree
robot yeah there's a lot of humanoid
robot yeah there's a lot of humanoid
robotic stuff at the
moment Isaac Jem oh yeah yeah yeah Isaac
moment Isaac Jem oh yeah yeah yeah Isaac
gem um I did a fair bit on that last
gem um I did a fair bit on that last
week I've got a guy who's cleaning up
week I've got a guy who's cleaning up
some stuff around that over the next day
some stuff around that over the next day
or two and then I'll be back on that as
or two and then I'll be back on that as
well
well
the Isaac JY stuff does work um we're
the Isaac JY stuff does work um we're
going to get some baselines we're going
going to get some baselines we're going
to get some stuff trained and we're
to get some stuff trained and we're
going to see how that goes from
there want to finish this grid end I'm
there want to finish this grid end I'm
just not sure how I want to
just not sure how I want to
do I don't know how I want to do the
do I don't know how I want to do the
state
logic hey Spencer
man this is
irritating ironically if I had actually
irritating ironically if I had actually
made like a grill a grid cell object I
made like a grill a grid cell object I
wouldn't have this
wouldn't have this
problem
um but that's kind of no I'd still have
um but that's kind of no I'd still have
this
this
problem how was vacation went to the uh
problem how was vacation went to the uh
the galpagos
the galpagos
and it was more of an adventure than a
and it was more of an adventure than a
vacation to be honest I saw a bunch of
vacation to be honest I saw a bunch of
very cool stuff but it was not very
very cool stuff but it was not very
restful and uh the main thing I realized
restful and uh the main thing I realized
is I really can't be taking vacations
is I really can't be taking vacations
anymore with the amount of stuff going
anymore with the amount of stuff going
on with puffer cuz I'm kind of just
on with puffer cuz I'm kind of just
watching my inbox piling up with stuff
watching my inbox piling up with stuff
to do and uh it ends up you know I just
to do and uh it ends up you know I just
end up being more stressed than when I
end up being more stressed than when I
left
left
um so I'm probably not going to be
um so I'm probably not going to be
vacationing really for a couple of years
vacationing really for a couple of years
but that's fine
I want to get puffer off the ground
properly man I hate when I'm just
properly man I hate when I'm just
staring at stuff like this but uh
staring at stuff like this but uh
yeah I actually I was I was making like
yeah I actually I was I was making like
great Pace before I left if anything
great Pace before I left if anything
it's like getting off my schedule that
it's like getting off my schedule that
burns me out right I get good sleep I
burns me out right I get good sleep I
get good uh I have a good diet I have
get good uh I have a good diet I have
good exercise and all that goes out the
good exercise and all that goes out the
window when I go
window when I go
away almost done with
away almost done with
plg move conditions in BFS solver so far
plg move conditions in BFS solver so far
so good chimy logic and block pushing
so good chimy logic and block pushing
very nice and as soon as you finish that
very nice and as soon as you finish that
we will uh we'll start getting you on
we will uh we'll start getting you on
some some cool science side efforts most
some some cool science side efforts most
likely I'm doing a procedurally
likely I'm doing a procedurally
generated maze environment as
generated maze environment as
well this is just a 2d maze
environment it's almost done just have
environment it's almost done just have
to figure out how I just have to figure
to figure out how I just have to figure
out this last thing here which is with
out this last thing here which is with
loading and saving and stuff
now I really don't like losing my buffer
now I really don't like losing my buffer
checks
it's going to be creating a
set you have to run um well technically
set you have to run um well technically
it is O ofen but still it's kind of a
it is O ofen but still it's kind of a
chunky algorithm for an noen does a
chunky algorithm for an noen does a
bunch of checks
I wonder if it is fast enough to do in
I wonder if it is fast enough to do in
the training loop I would doubt it
okay I think I'm going to make save and
okay I think I'm going to make save and
load functions instead of messing with
load functions instead of messing with
the memory like this and it's just going
the memory like this and it's just going
to be two meeps instead of
to be two meeps instead of
one it's just going to be two meeps
one it's just going to be two meeps
instead of
instead of
one
um but then you need a freaking game
um but then you need a freaking game
State variable don't
you
e e
I think we're just going to do
this this is going to be the state
I put it down here
I want to pass this
I want to pass this
through there's a copy eye there
maybe I
do yeah hold
on you pass it as a
copy and this whole thing goes onto the
copy and this whole thing goes onto the
stack though
stack though
right but these Maps aren't huge maybe
right but these Maps aren't huge maybe
that's fine we'll try this
ah but this will be a pointer so this I
ah but this will be a pointer so this I
got to be careful here
got to be careful here
so this is a get date
so this is a get date
so you actually what you have to do
is this is kind of
is this is kind of
weird there's some pointer Shenanigans
here I'm getting very high variance that
here I'm getting very high variance that
that's possible depending on the
that's possible depending on the
environment that's very possible
yeah so the issue here is that this is
yeah so the issue here is that this is
it'll copy the pointer but then it'll be
it'll copy the pointer but then it'll be
pointing to the same data
what if we make you pass in a
state we'll just do you'll just you'll
state we'll just do you'll just you'll
pass in a
state all right then probably something
state all right then probably something
was
weird with is M like
weird with is M like
this and
then there we go so this is get State
then there we go so this is get State
and then set
and then set
State we'll uh we'll also give you state
State we'll uh we'll also give you state
Star
Star
State and we'll do n with height no
Agents
Set so n
Set so n
grid I don't know what's wrong with this
grid I don't know what's wrong with this
thing it doesn't see the pointer on this
thing it doesn't see the pointer on this
apparently probably because of the dots
apparently probably because of the dots
above it
there we
go so this is pretty easy get State set
go so this is pretty easy get State set
State like
this and the reset doesn't need to
be like
so now let me figure out out how I'm
so now let me figure out out how I'm
going to do this first and C I'd say
create maze
create maze
level so we'll just do
level so we'll just do
oops create maze
oops create maze
level
level
M difficulty is
0.85 and Seed
zero we also need to specify width and
zero we also need to specify width and
height
height
here I would
here I would
say um yeah we need to specify withd and
say um yeah we need to specify withd and
height you doing a random gen
for your plg or a known maze uh it is a
for your plg or a known maze uh it is a
growing tree
it's a kind of a nice algorithm because
it's a kind of a nice algorithm because
it lets you interpolate between
it lets you interpolate between
recursive backtracking and prims which
recursive backtracking and prims which
kind of gives you a difficulty slider in
kind of gives you a difficulty slider in
addition to
size pretty
cool for
search algorithms just
search algorithms just
working
working
yeah well Ser you don't have to do them
yeah well Ser you don't have to do them
very often right
what's your batch size and
stuff so let me tell you where you want
stuff so let me tell you where you want
to be for RL to make sense
to be for RL to make sense
okay for RL to make sense and not be
okay for RL to make sense and not be
incredibly
incredibly
painful this is where you want to
be all right you want to be at the point
where you can go to some dashboard like
where you can go to some dashboard like
this all right and then you can
this all right and then you can
just go to group by tags whoops Group
by can't click
there we go you want to basically just
there we go you want to basically just
be in a spot we can Group by
be in a spot we can Group by
tags you can go to your
plots and just like look at stuff like
plots and just like look at stuff like
this all right and then you want to know
this all right and then you want to know
if learning rate is screwy you go to
if learning rate is screwy you go to
learning rate and see where it's good
and you can you know you have multiple
and you can you know you have multiple
the
the
dashboards so like yeah this one's
dashboards so like yeah this one's
good and then you can just go look at
good and then you can just go look at
your learning rate and say here this is
your learning rate and say here this is
the stable region right here right this
the stable region right here right this
this is what you
want buffer length 10o per update is a
want buffer length 10o per update is a
ton
ton
look at the default prams we have for
look at the default prams we have for
some of our algorithms like this is
some of our algorithms like this is
where you want to get to and we've
where you want to get to and we've
already done most of the work for you in
already done most of the work for you in
puffer Leb so it's perfectly fine to
puffer Leb so it's perfectly fine to
implement your own algorithms and stuff
implement your own algorithms and stuff
but uh you know don't expect to use
but uh you know don't expect to use
those
those
implementations to get real work done
implementations to get real work done
because it takes months and months to
because it takes months and months to
get good
get good
implementations sometimes more than
implementations sometimes more than
that in the config files we got all the
that in the config files we got all the
DOA needs for different uh envir at
DOA needs for different uh envir at
least you can look at sweep
ranges I mean most of them are good some
ranges I mean most of them are good some
of them are outdated but most of them
of them are outdated but most of them
are
good yeah it's all in
good yeah it's all in
puffer all in
puffer all in
puffer actually I have not had restream
puffer actually I have not had restream
up this whole
up this whole
time go check
oh apparently there's seven people
oh apparently there's seven people
watching me sleepily code cool hi
everyone let's actually get this done in
everyone let's actually get this done in
that
that
case so we're going to do with will be
yeah let's try
this
off this is good so now we make the maze
off this is good so now we make the maze
level we'll try this out to see if this
level we'll try this out to see if this
is what we
want e
mini
batch no mini batch size is not buffer
batch no mini batch size is not buffer
length there is no buffer length in uh
length there is no buffer length in uh
in puffer lib because you don't always
in puffer lib because you don't always
collect the same number of steps from an
collect the same number of steps from an
environment so batch size is the total
environment so batch size is the total
number of steps you're going to collect
number of steps you're going to collect
from all the different environments that
from all the different environments that
you're simulating um per update and then
you're simulating um per update and then
mini batches how many of those samples
mini batches how many of those samples
you're going to use for each gradient
you're going to use for each gradient
step
yeah check the puffer implementation
yeah check the puffer implementation
right the puffer implementation will
right the puffer implementation will
clear stuff up it's based on clean RL
clear stuff up it's based on clean RL
which is the best implementation out
which is the best implementation out
there it's just uh it's just a little
there it's just uh it's just a little
faster by a little faster I mean like up
faster by a little faster I mean like up
to 30 times faster you
to 30 times faster you
know sometimes we do a little perf
know sometimes we do a little perf
optimization
passing oh this is because this needs to
passing oh this is because this needs to
be this needs to be a me copy not a me
set
set
yeah you know the uh the puffer ocean
yeah you know the uh the puffer ocean
has has a few cool environments in it we
has has a few cool environments in it we
could
say well that's not quite right it's
say well that's not quite right it's
almost right but not quite right
[Music]
so this just has to
be we do
this holy
this holy
okay um that's amusing
how I built this locally
right that's interesting how it's able
right that's interesting how it's able
to seg fault it should not be able to
to seg fault it should not be able to
seg
fault so this is now correct but the
fault so this is now correct but the
puffer's in the wrong spot
puffer's in the wrong spot
spawn agent
was very weird
was very weird
maybe it's rendering
weird where's rendering
that looks fine to
me why does the puffer go
me why does the puffer go
here why is this where the puffer is
zero X and Y
right still don't know where the bug is
right still don't know where the bug is
thank you very
much Max size
much Max size
set max size should be set
H it's weird that it spawns the puffer
there maybe we'll look in uh the
renderer I don't know if you can
renderer I don't know if you can
actually put a break point here
looks like you
looks like you
can okay so we
can okay so we
do y
do y
x uh it got set to 16 that's probably
x uh it got set to 16 that's probably
just something in the C file that I
just something in the C file that I
forgot to
remove yep there it is
though the create maze level should have
uh hang on great maze level should have
uh hang on great maze level should have
overwritten this
oh
stupid there we go so we'll have to
stupid there we go so we'll have to
figure out why it's occasionally seg
figure out why it's occasionally seg
faulting but here is a
faulting but here is a
maze this is where you go to solve the
maze this is where you go to solve the
maze stuff to handle
maze stuff to handle
resets this also requires quite precise
resets this also requires quite precise
control to not get
control to not get
stuck and then it dumps you into an
stuck and then it dumps you into an
empty
empty
environment
environment
um and then all we have to do is call
um and then all we have to do is call
get
State all we got to do is close so get
State all we got to do is close so get
step
Let's see we actually
Let's see we actually
get errors
now should put l lvm on here by default
to do add GDB and llvm to default puffer
tank okay now we actually get
something state
right
here does mem copy not work the way I
here does mem copy not work the way I
think it does what are the args on M
think it does what are the args on M
Copy it's probably a good thing that I
Copy it's probably a good thing that I
don't know this because it means I don't
don't know this because it means I don't
mem copy stuff around too often
two from
bytes no I'm
bytes no I'm
correct so why does this not
work Mac not have yeah you
work Mac not have yeah you
are can you not just stick a Docker
are can you not just stick a Docker
container on it do I need to build you a
container on it do I need to build you a
CPU Duff a CPU puffer tank cuz you
CPU Duff a CPU puffer tank cuz you
really are coding on hard mode for no
really are coding on hard mode for no
reason uh Adam
yeah Spencer like f sanitized is the
yeah Spencer like f sanitized is the
difference between liking C and hating
C like not having this was the reason
C like not having this was the reason
that I hated um my systems courses in
undergrad this is Linux
yeah you can do that but uh next time
yeah you can do that but uh next time
you get a seg fult remember that you
you get a seg fult remember that you
don't actually have to deal with
that why the heck is that not a
thing it should be a
thing if you find a compile build that
thing if you find a compile build that
uh runs it we can add
it so how would I
it so how would I
still because you can render through the
still because you can render through the
docker
duh I'm in a Docker now
this is a Docker you see the little
this is a Docker you see the little
puffer symbol puffer symbols the docker
prompt that's why he's there to tell you
prompt that's why he's there to tell you
that you're in the docker
I should be able to copy here right even
I should be able to copy here right even
those data on the stack
okay so yeah null argument passed
I
I
see and this is
see and this is
because I did not call
because I did not call
reset what did I not call a it
wait is is the M Copy signature
backwards I thought it's two and
backwards I thought it's two and
from this
from this
wrong two
from
from
two
two
wait n
wait n
State copy to
state but this should have an
address oh
dummy uh okay so this needs to be copied
dummy uh okay so this needs to be copied
to somewhere
so this make size of
State oh I just need an Alex State fun
State oh I just need an Alex State fun
okay this is me being
sleepy like this
there we
there we
go that's super basic
uh you need Max size
this there we go
I really don't need
I really don't need
the allocate as much as I need the
the allocate as much as I need the
init you state
state state like this
maybe hold on let me read
maybe hold on let me read
that P is doing better it's officially
faster any of the common architectures
faster any of the common architectures
that I use should work if you have like
that I use should work if you have like
a five layer feed for net is probably
a five layer feed for net is probably
not going to
not going to
work I can look at it if you
need e
fair
enough I would like to finish this after
all bro thanks CB to be
sass are we getting freaking invaded by
sass are we getting freaking invaded by
Twitter
Bots is this the freaking creator of the
Bots is this the freaking creator of the
coin still trying to convince me to do
coin still trying to convince me to do
this with Bots like just
this with Bots like just
stop all right
stop no then why are you doing this the
stop no then why are you doing this the
original coin was a
scam that wasn't me
scam that wasn't me
that's somebody obviously impersonating
me well obviously I'm an MIT PhD what do
me well obviously I'm an MIT PhD what do
you
you
expect your coin lost me 10K I posted as
expect your coin lost me 10K I posted as
soon as I saw it that uh it wasn't
me yeah this is definitely
me yeah this is definitely
Bots lovely
okay whoever you are running this net do
okay whoever you are running this net do
you seriously have nothing better to
do like piss off I'm trying to build
do like piss off I'm trying to build
some cool stuff
here yeah it's just 10 Twitter accounts
here yeah it's just 10 Twitter accounts
that happen to join at the same
time
mhm you either multi clien or whatever
okay this works but then it doesn't
okay this works but then it doesn't
reset correctly
this
done okay dun doesn't reset
correctly fix
correctly fix
that I'm
DS res set Rewards
ah whatever man
WS I should reset
DS
rewards and then episode return should
rewards and then episode return should
get reset on its own
right oh this is silly this is just a
right oh this is silly this is just a
placeholder for uh proper log struct
placeholder for uh proper log struct
that's
that's
fine let's see if this gets it to reset
fine let's see if this gets it to reset
correctly
very
nice okay so that
nice okay so that
works so now we have a basic PCG maze
environment and it has to render it full
environment and it has to render it full
size like that as well because the mazes
size like that as well because the mazes
can vary in size just fine
uh and let me see if I can
load 10 to
three so 10 EPO is crazy high because
three so 10 EPO is crazy high because
usually it's unstable if somehow you're
usually it's unstable if somehow you're
keeping it stable for those 10 Epoch
keeping it stable for those 10 Epoch
then yes it will increase sample
then yes it will increase sample
efficiency
efficiency
um it should not be approximately equal
um it should not be approximately equal
the same time though because if you have
the same time though because if you have
your system correctly
your system correctly
tuned then you should be able to get new
tuned then you should be able to get new
samples uh for free instead of getting
samples uh for free instead of getting
old samples so you can train more on new
old samples so you can train more on new
data instead of on old data which is how
data instead of on old data which is how
we have it in puffer because the
we have it in puffer because the
environments are so fast
it's probably just poorly optimized is
it's probably just poorly optimized is
all I mean on any like little simple end
all I mean on any like little simple end
you should be pushing hundreds of
you should be pushing hundreds of
thousands of steps per second
thousands of steps per second
you'll find that things just magically
you'll find that things just magically
start working when you have that
seg falter OS being
weird look at
this
this
interesting seems like this only one
interesting seems like this only one
locked door I think in this setup right
locked door I think in this setup right
yeah these are there's only one locked
yeah these are there's only one locked
door this is the
key why can't I run into the key
key why can't I run into the key
here it does not let me collect the
here it does not let me collect the
key
interesting so I must have broken
something yeah you just have your pram
something yeah you just have your pram
set silly
set silly
I look at the way we do stuff on puffer
I look at the way we do stuff on puffer
man you use batch size like a thousand
man you use batch size like a thousand
parallel
Ms or serial M if they're fast
enough like the CM are fast enough we
enough like the CM are fast enough we
just run them in Cal and we run like
just run them in Cal and we run like
4,000 of them and we
4,000 of them and we
chill let me fix this bug before uh I
chill let me fix this bug before uh I
got to get dinner soon now let me fix
got to get dinner soon now let me fix
this
this
bug good

all they're
all they're
doing um this is not going to be the way

now I mean there are a couple like
now I mean there are a couple like
actually good companies that have kind
actually good companies that have kind
of done something good on top of stuff

uh but again it's just a matter of time
uh but again it's just a matter of time
before the llm providers just build it
before the llm providers just build it
into their own ones like perplexity is
into their own ones like perplexity is
actually pretty darn good I think they
actually pretty darn good I think they
actually have better browsing at the
actually have better browsing at the
moment than open Ai and anybody else has

built in but you know it's only a matter
built in but you know it's only a matter
of time and probably unless these things

scale user bases very very fast uh the
scale user bases very very fast uh the
most that they're going to probably do
most that they're going to probably do
is get a fired at like some good
is get a fired at like some good

yeah okay you didn't join when all the

other ones did so may be
legit but yeah it's

mean it's like it's the low skill people
who are literally
who are literally
yeah I see more Bots um it's literally
yeah I see more Bots um it's literally

um it's uh it's literally like most of
um it's uh it's literally like most of
the LM startups a lot of them are just
the LM startups a lot of them are just
like the low skill people trying to get
like the low skill people trying to get
into AI because like now you don't have
into AI because like now you don't have
to understand how models work you can
to understand how models work you can
just write Loops over stuff and to be
just write Loops over stuff and to be
fair sometimes you can actually build
fair sometimes you can actually build
useful products in the short term doing
useful products in the short term doing
that uh maybe even in the longer term if
that uh maybe even in the longer term if
you have something very very specific
you have something very very specific
right um but yeah the majority of them
right um but yeah the majority of them
are going to get
steamrolled there is no yeah there's no
coin I do uh ultra high performance
coin I do uh ultra high performance
reinforcement learning it's just
reinforcement learning it's just
somebody using my name and my company
somebody using my name and my company
brand
does this have to get set
to1 spawn
agent ah it's cuz it's not it doesn't
agent ah it's cuz it's not it doesn't
get set here so we'll uh we'll fix that
get set here so we'll uh we'll fix that
up when we refactor this
up when we refactor this
bit um but for the meantime I should
bit um but for the meantime I should
just be able to do agent is one like
just be able to do agent is one like
this
there's just no there's no
point the goal for the year financially
point the goal for the year financially
is to scale puffer to uh 1 million AR
is to scale puffer to uh 1 million AR
which I think is going to be very
which I think is going to be very
possible with what I'm doing
now it takes a few more
now it takes a few more
clients there we go so um I guess guess
clients there we go so um I guess guess
all these other doors are open which
all these other doors are open which
yeah they're all green so it's literally
yeah they're all green so it's literally
there is just one locked door in this
there is just one locked door in this
environment it's just the mini locked
environment it's just the mini locked
in and you go like
in and you go like
this added you on YouTube thank
you all the demos are on puffer doai if
you all the demos are on puffer doai if
you're interested in in them they're uh
you're interested in in them they're uh
they're pretty fun they're like basic
they're pretty fun they're like basic
little games some of them not so basic
little games some of them not so basic
little games but they all run at like a
little games but they all run at like a
million steps per second 10,000 times
million steps per second 10,000 times
real time when we train AI on them so I
real time when we train AI on them so I
mean stuff like this now we have we can
mean stuff like this now we have we can
do stuff like train buff on, 1500 years
do stuff like train buff on, 1500 years
worth of games on one
GPU and it's all open
GPU and it's all open
source and most of the code is now
source and most of the code is now
contributed by community members so it's
contributed by community members so it's
a fun project and it's a great way to
a fun project and it's a great way to
advance this area of science because all
advance this area of science because all
the research these days seems to require
the research these days seems to require
a $100 million
cluster if I were purely motivated by
cluster if I were purely motivated by
money I wouldn't be doing this this is
money I wouldn't be doing this this is
science first money second there will be
science first money second there will be
money there will be return on this
money there will be return on this
but this is the primary goal of this
but this is the primary goal of this
project is to revolutionize
project is to revolutionize
reinforcement
reinforcement
learning and we're well on our
way I mean I are you kidding me of
way I mean I are you kidding me of
course I wouldn't be doing this right
course I wouldn't be doing this right
there's so many other areas of AI that
there's so many other areas of AI that
are so much easier you kidding me so
are so much easier you kidding me so
much easier to just like
I mean this is fun too
right but yeah I mean we've shipped
right but yeah I mean we've shipped
puffer is now close to like 30,000 lines
puffer is now close to like 30,000 lines
of uh of ship code most of which is SE
of uh of ship code most of which is SE
environments
fixes it's not fun outside of
fixes it's not fun outside of
puffer took me very many years to figure
puffer took me very many years to figure
out how to make it not horrible and it's
out how to make it not horrible and it's
going to get much better from
here do you know if something similar
here do you know if something similar
exists for chatting with
customers I mean you mean like the way
customers I mean you mean like the way
that companies have been replacing their
that companies have been replacing their
support with chat
support with chat
box
um this Tech wouldn't be for that I mean
um this Tech wouldn't be for that I mean
this Tech is used on top of language
this Tech is used on top of language
models to improve them um but in the way
models to improve them um but in the way
that I'm using it now it's not for that
that I'm using it now it's not for that
um this is mostly going to be used in
um this is mostly going to be used in
robotics various industrial processes
robotics various industrial processes
across a ton of different fields and
across a ton of different fields and
various miscellaneous
tasks because this is not this is not RL
tasks because this is not this is not RL
on language models this is RL tabularasa
on language models this is RL tabularasa
from scratch with much smaller models on
from scratch with much smaller models on
mostly game environments but all other
mostly game environments but all other
types of Sims as well that we're
types of Sims as well that we're
building um you know stuff like this we
building um you know stuff like this we
got like miniature version of of DOTA
got like miniature version of of DOTA
here we've got like some classic arcade
here we've got like some classic arcade
tasks like pong and breakout and
tasks like pong and breakout and
stuff um but the the cool thing about
stuff um but the the cool thing about
this is that you can actually do this
this is that you can actually do this
research at a reasonable scale uh we can
research at a reasonable scale uh we can
chew through as much data as all of GPD
chew through as much data as all of GPD
4 and about one GPU with some of these
4 and about one GPU with some of these
small little models and we can actually
small little models and we can actually
train agents capable of solving game
train agents capable of solving game
environments and solving various useful
environments and solving various useful
things like that industrial process yeah
things like that industrial process yeah
I think that that's going to be one of
I think that that's going to be one of
the main areas of course it's going to
the main areas of course it's going to
have to get a little bit more stable and
have to get a little bit more stable and
a little bit more out of the box first
a little bit more out of the box first
so generally we're starting with tasks
so generally we're starting with tasks
that are a lot more visually
that are a lot more visually
interpretable because there's a lot of
interpretable because there's a lot of
back and forth
back and forth
debugging but as it gets more stable
debugging but as it gets more stable
we're going to move into that AI into my
we're going to move into that AI into my
simulation game uh if you're thinking
simulation game uh if you're thinking
like enemy AI npca I and so on yes this
like enemy AI npca I and so on yes this
is the tech that you would use for that
is the tech that you would use for that
now mind you it's still pretty like
now mind you it's still pretty like
pretty new tech and it still requires a
pretty new tech and it still requires a
fair bit of experience to get working on
fair bit of experience to get working on
any new problem uh we're currently
any new problem uh we're currently
trying to make it substantially easier
trying to make it substantially easier
right that's what I'm doing with puffer
right that's what I'm doing with puffer
Li make it easier make it better make it
Li make it easier make it better make it
faster all of that um and it is rapidly
faster all of that um and it is rapidly
getting better but yes this is the tech
getting better but yes this is the tech
that you would use for
that so gaming will be you know one
that so gaming will be you know one
potential uh or one pretty large
potential uh or one pretty large
application area
I've chatted with a few gaming companies
I've chatted with a few gaming companies
we don't have any contracts in that area
we don't have any contracts in that area
just yet but uh hey puffer still
just yet but uh hey puffer still
relatively new and it takes uh it takes
relatively new and it takes uh it takes
a while to build up a nice client
base okay I think I'm done with this for
base okay I think I'm done with this for
to now I think the only thing that I
to now I think the only thing that I
have to
have to
do the only thing that I have to do on
do the only thing that I have to do on
this now is I have to get the binding to
this now is I have to get the binding to
scyon
scyon
um initially it's probably just going to
um initially it's probably just going to
be a very simple binding and then we're
be a very simple binding and then we're
going to add in curriculum learning type
going to add in curriculum learning type
features so that you can uh reset the
features so that you can uh reset the
map to a specific maze level depending
map to a specific maze level depending
on its difficulty based on uh how well
on its difficulty based on uh how well
you've been doing on that previously
you've been doing on that previously
so that'll be
so that'll be
interesting uh but yeah I'm going to
interesting uh but yeah I'm going to
break for dinner I'll probably be back
break for dinner I'll probably be back
on afterwards depending on how long that
on afterwards depending on how long that
takes and see if I can knock out like an
takes and see if I can knock out like an
extra hour or so might not depends I got
extra hour or so might not depends I got
to look at uh what stuff I got a prep
to look at uh what stuff I got a prep
for tomorrow but probably so I'd like to
for tomorrow but probably so I'd like to
finish this um so thanks for tuning in
finish this um so thanks for tuning in
folks and if you're interested in this
folks and if you're interested in this
work it's all on

you're interested in getting involved
you're interested in getting involved
with development most of this is led by
with development most of this is led by
community members you don't need RL
community members you don't need RL
experience you just need a good
experience you just need a good
programming background and uh you'll
programming background and uh you'll
pick up the rest pretty quick and if you
pick up the rest pretty quick and if you
want more content than that we have
want more content than that we have
stuff on the blog but we've also got
stuff on the blog but we've also got
some articles on my ex that you can't
some articles on my ex that you can't
find anywhere else think you'll do well
find anywhere else think you'll do well
with Riot games got a meeting on the
with Riot games got a meeting on the
books with them um full of Bots full Bot
books with them um full of Bots full Bot
games that play really well yeah for
sure yeah check the site out I mean
sure yeah check the site out I mean
we've got a ton of people in the Discord
we've got a ton of people in the Discord
all building cool stuff so
