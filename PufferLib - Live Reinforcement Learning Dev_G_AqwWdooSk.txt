Hello, we are back
live. I do not know what is wrong with
sweeps. It's really very
sweeps. It's really very
rare for me to like lose runs like this.
It happened once before and it was
It happened once before and it was
actually possibly very related.

H if I can actually figure out the root

here, I'm definitely going to make

adjustments so that this never happens

again.
So, I guess what we have for now to look
So, I guess what we have for now to look
at, we've got the 200 run sweep from
at, we've got the 200 run sweep from
last
last
night and we have got the
uh the old sweep that was
good. Go to
sample and we'll see what params are
sample and we'll see what params are
weird looking.
Okay, gamma is a little bit
Okay, gamma is a little bit
low. The only really notable
low. The only really notable
thing, we do have samples though that
thing, we do have samples though that
are that high. They just don't work as
are that high. They just don't work as
well.
Fine. I just want to make sure like to
Fine. I just want to make sure like to
start that it is actually sampling
start that it is actually sampling
everywhere.
We are sampling
everywhere. Massive difference.
The total time steps thing is
like you know there is a difference but
like you know there is a difference but
we should be able to get the results
we should be able to get the results
even out here.
The mini batch sizes are like not that
The mini batch sizes are like not that
far off from each
other. Actually, this does better with
other. Actually, this does better with
32k.
is not finding the really ridiculous
is not finding the really ridiculous
small mini batch pram.
So, Adam beta
So, Adam beta
1 is notably too
low,
right? And then beta 2 is notably too
right? And then beta 2 is notably too
high.
Not really though, cuz this at least you
Not really though, cuz this at least you
have 0.9 Nat.
The only thing I've seen suspicious so
The only thing I've seen suspicious so
far is a few parameters that
far is a few parameters that
like the top end. It's not like getting
like the top end. It's not like getting
all the way to the top
And maybe This is telling here. Maybe
And maybe This is telling here. Maybe
this is
this is
telling. Getting its best
results, two
results, two
environments, or two
2x496. The one that's good. And this
2x496. The one that's good. And this
one's only doing half.
You know
what? Isn't this kind of
close? Like with one O, it's like
close? Like with one O, it's like
spending a lot of time on one
spending a lot of time on one
environment here and that matches with
environment here and that matches with
this.
Not spending enough time on
this.
this.
The
The
angel is Mary.
That's the biggest
That's the biggest
like that's the biggest smoking gun we
like that's the biggest smoking gun we
found so far.
But the question is like Bye.
go take a look at the latest sweep.
Okay. So this is 100
runs that I know is running the correct
runs that I know is running the correct
mini batch and everything.
do the exact same thing I was doing
before. Got the learning rate too
low. Well, the best run is O1. It does
low. Well, the best run is O1. It does
have O1, so it's a little skewed, but
have O1, so it's a little skewed, but
it's not
it's not
bad. Got gamma. Gamma is still too low.
bad. Got gamma. Gamma is still too low.
Okay. So now this is two in a row for
Okay. So now this is two in a row for
gamma's too low.
gamma's too low.
Lambda.
This I've equated for and I' I've run
This I've equated for and I' I've run
multiple tests, so don't worry about
that. Got over here for a bit so I can
actually track of it.
86% is our
86% is our
best 97.
Okay.
Okay.
So having looked at
everything, the
only thing that is consistently off is
only thing that is consistently off is
gamma. If we look at gamma up top,
thing is you can get 90
thing is you can get 90
score even with gamma
of.98 but I'm not that far off from
of.98 but I'm not that far off from
that. The thing is in order to get
that. The thing is in order to get
higher than
that.9 do
this and we have above
80. Am I seeing [ __ ] or is this
80. Am I seeing [ __ ] or is this
legitimate?
Right. There's definitely a peak right
Right. There's definitely a peak right
here. Right.
here. Right.
There's a big cluster of good runs above
0.9. If we go back to like the point 8,
0.9. If we go back to like the point 8,
we're fighting
over. No, there's still a gap. I think
over. No, there's still a gap. I think
there is still a gap.
Even with gamma being
Even with gamma being
set, it's weird that it doesn't go up to
set, it's weird that it doesn't go up to
max, but there is still a gap even
max, but there is still a gap even
without it,
without it,
right? Pretty substantial
one. Got to keep in mind the
um not
um not
this progress.
like it. This is how many
like it. This is how many
runs I'm going to freaking
count.
count.
Or no, I'm going to count, but I'm going
Or no, I'm going to count, but I'm going
to count more smart. I'm going to count
to count more smart. I'm going to count
smarter than this.
how I'm going to
count now the last page. Oh, be the
count now the last page. Oh, be the
first page that I go
first page that I go
to. They're disabling runs.
Okay, this is what this looks like here.
We only get two
We only get two
runs, three runs above
runs, three runs above
0.9 in the first
98.
Here we get
Here we get
zero. We get a whole bunch that are
zero. We get a whole bunch that are
above 08 in both
It's so weird to me. Like, this is such
It's so weird to me. Like, this is such
strong evidence. Hey,
strong evidence. Hey,
Spencer, I'm trying to fix sweeps. I can
Spencer, I'm trying to fix sweeps. I can
chat though if you uh if you're around.
chat though if you uh if you're around.
Looks like you got some results.
Yo.
Yo.
Hey. I'm still stuck on sweeps, man.
Hey. I'm still stuck on sweeps, man.
If I fix this bug, I deserve to be
If I fix this bug, I deserve to be
inducted by the Vatican into their like
inducted by the Vatican into their like
secret holy order of demon slayers.
Oh, that's funny. This is like so
Oh, that's funny. This is like so
cursed, but it looks like you've been
cursed, but it looks like you've been
getting results in the meantime.
getting results in the meantime.
Is there any is there any hope anymore
Is there any is there any hope anymore
right now or is it uh pretty cursed at
right now or is it uh pretty cursed at
the moment? I've run the same version of
the moment? I've run the same version of
the code.
Um, like I checked out the original
Um, like I checked out the original
branch, I ran a full sweep and there's
branch, I ran a full sweep and there's
like a 2x error
gap and it looks like the distribution
gap and it looks like the distribution
of hypers is very similar
of hypers is very similar
across. I've like run a whole bunch of
across. I've like run a whole bunch of
follow-ups. I've like
follow-ups. I've like
checked that the transcript is
checked that the transcript is
identical. I've checked that the sweep
identical. I've checked that the sweep
configuration is identical. Um, I've
configuration is identical. Um, I've
like gone through like probably 50
like gone through like probably 50
different commits. It's something
different commits. It's something
there's like possession involved here,
there's like possession involved here,
man.
Well, in some degree of positive news,
Well, in some degree of positive news,
the terraforming stuff is seemingly
the terraforming stuff is seemingly
working now. Awesome. Um, it's not
working now. Awesome. Um, it's not
perfect. There's things I'm running, you
perfect. There's things I'm running, you
know, I'm hunting for a Seg vault right
know, I'm hunting for a Seg vault right
now, but you got the debug mode, right?
now, but you got the debug mode, right?
Yeah, I'm I'm running um it's really
Yeah, I'm I'm running um it's really
annoying because I can't actually find
annoying because I can't actually find
the bug the bug unless it's training and
the bug the bug unless it's training and
it gets decently smart enough to
it gets decently smart enough to
discover said zgf fall. Load up a

there with debug mode on.
Okay. I I just have GD I'm just running
Okay. I I just have GD I'm just running
the GDB with the train right now. It
the GDB with the train right now. It
takes forever to train with like you can
takes forever to train with like you can
do that. And if if that doesn't work
do that. And if if that doesn't work
though, what I would do is I'd get like
though, what I would do is I'd get like
a checkpoint that's close to where it
a checkpoint that's close to where it
crashes and resume training on that
crashes and resume training on that
checkpoint like load model path or
checkpoint like load model path or
whatever. I think should be enough. Um,
whatever. I think should be enough. Um,
is that a is that a thing right now in
is that a is that a thing right now in
the buffer RL? I've never done load from
the buffer RL? I've never done load from
checkpoint on resume from training. Is
checkpoint on resume from training. Is
that we can load a model. We we don't
that we can load a model. We we don't
load the optimizer state at the moment,
load the optimizer state at the moment,
but we do load the
model. So it should at least do
model. So it should at least do
something.
something.
Okay. Well, hopefully this is just on
Okay. Well, hopefully this is just on
this run it will uh hopefully and how
this run it will uh hopefully and how
dev terform results magical thing is it
dev terform results magical thing is it
run things.
run things.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it

um I linked the sweep in the dev channel
um I linked the sweep in the dev channel
back in it
and it is able to solve quadrants.
And that is randomly assigned quadrants
And that is randomly assigned quadrants
right now just with one car running
right now just with one car running
around trying to find that it's its
around trying to find that it's its
target quadrant or is higher when you
target quadrant or is higher when you
run for
run for
longer. Um but it doesn't look like
longer. Um but it doesn't look like
quadrants is
quadrants is
so the quadrant progress is as gets
so the quadrant progress is as gets
reset every time you pick up a new
reset every time you pick up a new
quadrant. So that's why that number gets
quadrant. So that's why that number gets
doesn't like peak to like 99 is because
doesn't like peak to like 99 is because
that it averages down as you solve
that it averages down as you solve
quadrants.
So score is probably the most accurate
So score is probably the most accurate
metric of like legit success because
metric of like legit success because
when I ran eval with, you know, turning
when I ran eval with, you know, turning
off any form of resets, it's able to
off any form of resets, it's able to
solve like 15 to eight 15 to 20
solve like 15 to eight 15 to 20
quadrants just if you just let it run
forever. Oh, it found it found an issue.
forever. Oh, it found it found an issue.
Okay, solid.
I I've been posting some stuff just so
I I've been posting some stuff just so
we get them. Like I think that we should
we get them. Like I think that we should
try When did we sign the thing? Was it
try When did we sign the thing? Was it
like the 8th or the 9th? Uh the eighth.
like the 8th or the 9th? Uh the eighth.
Okay. I think that we should try to like
Okay. I think that we should try to like
just have barely started a thing on QD
just have barely started a thing on QD
for them in the next few days because uh
for them in the next few days because uh
that will increase the odds of renewal.
Oh, you want to start doing is that what
Oh, you want to start doing is that what
their next task is? Yeah.
their next task is? Yeah.
I mean, as you can see, it's like they
I mean, as you can see, it's like they
just like we package it for them very
just like we package it for them very
very easily and they just don't get to
very easily and they just don't get to
get around to like using it for quite a
get around to like using it for quite a
while. But yeah, I mean, at least this
while. But yeah, I mean, at least this
time like you can't they can't say like,
time like you can't they can't say like,
"Oh, it was too hard or whatever to like
"Oh, it was too hard or whatever to like
it's we we've actually done it like
it's we we've actually done it like
we've done a very very good job I think
we've done a very very good job I think
this time on it." Just like Yeah.
B this
bot can look at it next, you know, next
bot can look at it next, you know, next
week and then close out this this round,
week and then close out this this round,
this contract and then see if we'll look
this contract and then see if we'll look
at renewals. Yeah, they should. I mean,
at renewals. Yeah, they should. I mean,
based on what we've delivered, I like I
based on what we've delivered, I like I
can't see how they'll be like, now we
can't see how they'll be like, now we
got it from here.
Yeah. I mean, we pretty much just
Yeah. I mean, we pretty much just
steamrolled whatever was there before.
steamrolled whatever was there before.
which is how it should go generally when
which is how it should go generally when
we don't have crazy bugs. Like our core
we don't have crazy bugs. Like our core
tech is just that like it's that good
tech is just that like it's that good
now that we should just be able to do
now that we should just be able to do
that. A lot of value add just being like
that. A lot of value add just being like
the ones who have been developing the
the ones who have been developing the
stuff and knowing how to make it sing.
stuff and knowing how to make it sing.
Yeah. I mean the the next step that I
Yeah. I mean the the next step that I
think even with doing QD is just also
think even with doing QD is just also
having like proper train test split
having like proper train test split
evals while it trains.
evals while it trains.
Mhm. So, we'll discuss that and then we
Mhm. So, we'll discuss that and then we
can we can discuss privately offstream
can we can discuss privately offstream
whether you want to like continue stuff
whether you want to like continue stuff
with that and like know like depending
with that and like know like depending
on what they propose next and how that's
on what they propose next and how that's
going. But I think it's a pretty small
going. But I think it's a pretty small
amount of work for having a a like
amount of work for having a a like
deliver some pretty good results. I
deliver some pretty good results. I
think it's a pretty good setup at the
think it's a pretty good setup at the
moment. Yeah, like most the other
moment. Yeah, like most the other
clients the other clients Yeah, the
clients the other clients Yeah, the
other clients are like substantially
other clients are like substantially
more work to be able to add that amount
more work to be able to add that amount
of value. But yeah, we'll talk that. Um,
of value. But yeah, we'll talk that. Um,
okay. But back on stream on Terraform.
okay. But back on stream on Terraform.
So, here's the things that I'm changing
So, here's the things that I'm changing
right now. Um, knowing that it can solve
right now. Um, knowing that it can solve
uh quadrants. Uhhuh.
uh quadrants. Uhhuh.
What it does at the moment, which is
What it does at the moment, which is
kind of funny because it is optimal, but
kind of funny because it is optimal, but
it's not being punished for it, is every
it's not being punished for it, is every
time it solves a quadrant,
time it solves a quadrant,
it actually takes a scoop out of the
it actually takes a scoop out of the
quadrant it just solved to bring it to
quadrant it just solved to bring it to
the new target quadrant.
the new target quadrant.
That's funny.
That's funny.
So, I'm adding in, you know, mechanics
So, I'm adding in, you know, mechanics
to punish it from touching complete
to punish it from touching complete
quadrants.
quadrants.
That's actually so funny.
That's actually so funny.
Which I was like, god damn it. Like, why
Which I was like, god damn it. Like, why
are you exploiting this? Because the RL
are you exploiting this? Because the RL
is just good, man.
is just good, man.
Um, I I found one bug that is a little
Um, I I found one bug that is a little
annoying that's only related to doing
annoying that's only related to doing
quadrant work. So, I did want to talk
quadrant work. So, I did want to talk
with you about like is
with you about like is
their additional benefit at this point
their additional benefit at this point
knowing that it can solve quadrants the
knowing that it can solve quadrants the
way I've you know set up the reward
way I've you know set up the reward
engineering to treat it as a problem of
engineering to treat it as a problem of
you know perfectly solving all quadrants
you know perfectly solving all quadrants
on the map or letting it just try and
on the map or letting it just try and
solve all map
because when you solve like all
because when you solve like all
quadrants you have to do like a little
quadrants you have to do like a little
bit more of checks on like you're not
bit more of checks on like you're not
screwing with previous quadrants you
screwing with previous quadrants you
know you're you're as you're changing
know you're you're as you're changing
the world your targets in Those
the world your targets in Those
quadrants are
quadrants are
modified. Like you could pull from
modified. Like you could pull from
somewhere and then that current now like
somewhere and then that current now like
the problem you gave it originally is
the problem you gave it originally is
now different than when you spawn the
now different than when you spawn the
world.
I'm sorry. My brain just ignored all
I'm sorry. My brain just ignored all
like just like all those words did not
like just like all those words did not
like what would you what' you say?
like what would you what' you say?
So I'm trying
So I'm trying
to think about is it better
to think about is it better
to do this kind of quadrant centric
to do this kind of quadrant centric
learning. Uhhuh. Where you you know you
learning. Uhhuh. Where you you know you
solve all the quadrants on the map and
solve all the quadrants on the map and
then you solve the whole map or just
then you solve the whole map or just
solve all map. It is but there are some
solve all map. It is but there are some
like more complex dynamics when you have
like more complex dynamics when you have
to deal with quadrants.
to deal with quadrants.
Why are there more complex dynamics?
Um you have to and I mean this is just
Um you have to and I mean this is just
like in there. I don't think it's like
like in there. I don't think it's like
that big a deal. It's more like it as
that big a deal. It's more like it as
you're running around the world, right,
you're running around the world, right,
you are taking things from other
you are taking things from other
quadrants to in order to optimize your
quadrants to in order to optimize your
single quadrant, right? Oh, yeah. And
single quadrant, right? Oh, yeah. And
when you do that, when you when you set
when you do that, when you when you set
up the original of just solving all map
up the original of just solving all map
and only care about all map, it doesn't
and only care about all map, it doesn't
matter what you do in the meantime
matter what you do in the meantime
because you still have one
because you still have one
like original delta to go off of. like
like original delta to go off of. like
the world spawned like this and you need
the world spawned like this and you need
to take it to this. When you're dealing
to take it to this. When you're dealing
with quadrants, each quadrant's little
with quadrants, each quadrant's little
micro world gets modified throughout the
micro world gets modified throughout the
entire time until you become until it
entire time until you become until it
becomes the
target. I wouldn't worry too much
target. I wouldn't worry too much
because like we already have a bigger
because like we already have a bigger
map than they're going to need, don't
map than they're going to need, don't
we? I guess it depends what resolution
we? I guess it depends what resolution
we're assuming the simulation is running
we're assuming the simulation is running
at. Um yeah, I mean I dropped it to 64
at. Um yeah, I mean I dropped it to 64
by 64 just to like kind of get it.
by 64 just to like kind of get it.
What's a quadrant then?
Um 121 11 by 11s
because I just match it with the vision.
because I just match it with the vision.
Oh, so if it's like 11 by 11 like So I
Oh, so if it's like 11 by 11 like So I
mean you could say it's 1 meter by you
mean you could say it's 1 meter by you
could say it's 10, you know, 11 meters
could say it's 10, you know, 11 meters
by 11 meters if you wanted to. Yeah.
by 11 meters if you wanted to. Yeah.
Well, assuming we're doing like the
Well, assuming we're doing like the
granularity of it's like a very coarse
granularity of it's like a very coarse
sim, right? But yeah, I mean if you I
sim, right? But yeah, I mean if you I
mean it really just depends on what
mean it really just depends on what
number you pick. I mean to some degree
number you pick. I mean to some degree
it's irrelevant. If it can solve, if it
it's irrelevant. If it can solve, if it
can solve, you know, a total amount of,
can solve, you know, a total amount of,
you know, 4,000 quadrants on 64x 64, I
you know, 4,000 quadrants on 64x 64, I
see no reason why it couldn't solve, you
see no reason why it couldn't solve, you
know, 5,000
know, 5,000
quadrants or 10,000. Yeah, I think it's
quadrants or 10,000. Yeah, I think it's
a fine it's a fine way to go for now,
a fine it's a fine way to go for now,
especially like we
especially like we
probably the more I like think about
probably the more I like think about
what is the best way to go with these
what is the best way to go with these
Sims, right? the more I think I the more
Sims, right? the more I think I the more
I'm thinking like the best the first
I'm thinking like the best the first
thing we want to do is just like get
thing we want to do is just like get
something cool that roughly looks like
something cool that roughly looks like
the problem and then the details of
the problem and then the details of
those like let's actually get the
those like let's actually get the
contracts right before we put all the
contracts right before we put all the
effort the like all the details of it um
effort the like all the details of it um
just so that you know we actually have
just so that you know we actually have
something going with that. I'm kind of
something going with that. I'm kind of
going to do the same thing on the new
going to do the same thing on the new
sim that I'm working on.
sim that I'm working on.
Um, I think that's probably the main
Um, I think that's probably the main
thing. So, like, have you seen the
thing. So, like, have you seen the
policies lately? Do they look cool?
policies lately? Do they look cool?
Like,
Like,
what? Yeah. No, I mean, they work. You
what? Yeah. No, I mean, they work. You
know, it's pulling dirt from places.
know, it's pulling dirt from places.
It's it's flattening it out. I mean, I
It's it's flattening it out. I mean, I
haven't done to pllin to pear yet.
haven't done to pllin to pear yet.
Um, right now it's going pearl to random
Um, right now it's going pearl to random
flats, but what's random flats?
flats, but what's random flats?
What's up? Can you make it like
What's up? Can you make it like
structured flats so it looks interesting
structured flats so it looks interesting
at least? Like so you like you make your
at least? Like so you like you make your
like Didn't you say that it's basically
like Didn't you say that it's basically
just like a bunch of pads or whatever
just like a bunch of pads or whatever
that you build? Yeah.
that you build? Yeah.
So can you do something like that? I
So can you do something like that? I
could do structured flats. I mean I I
could do structured flats. I mean I I
could make it a grid of
could make it a grid of
flats as opposed to just the whole thing
flats as opposed to just the whole thing
flat.
Well, like a grid of flats. It's like
Well, like a grid of flats. It's like
there's like a divot. So they'd
there's like a divot. So they'd
basically have like a walkway in between
basically have like a walkway in between
the plots or whatever is. Yeah, that's
the plots or whatever is. Yeah, that's
how it would look. It would look like a
how it would look. It would look like a
bunch of lots effectively. Lots. Yeah,
bunch of lots effectively. Lots. Yeah,
that would be decent. I think the other
that would be decent. I think the other
thing that you could do if we wanted to
thing that you could do if we wanted to
be slightly fancier is like we could
be slightly fancier is like we could
like I don't know just come up with some
like I don't know just come up with some
structures to like randomly assign,
structures to like randomly assign,
right? So we could make it like, oh
right? So we could make it like, oh
yeah, builds a pyramid in some of them.
yeah, builds a pyramid in some of them.
It builds like a cube in others. It like
It builds like a cube in others. It like
flattens like whatever. And then it
flattens like whatever. And then it
would just be really freaking obvious.
would just be really freaking obvious.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean you could do a whole
Yeah. Yeah, I mean you could do a whole
bunch of things. I mean at a at a next
bunch of things. I mean at a at a next
immediate step for sure I could do like
immediate step for sure I could do like
a structured grid that looks like an
a structured grid that looks like an
actual like subdivision. See if that
actual like subdivision. See if that
works. I think see if that works first
works. I think see if that works first
like some subdivisions and then we can
like some subdivisions and then we can
see if like we want to have them build
see if like we want to have them build
some stuff on the subdivisions, right?
some stuff on the subdivisions, right?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean the only thing that
Yeah. Yeah, I mean the only thing that
becomes complex there is I think you
becomes complex there is I think you
I'll have to start adding another action
I'll have to start adding another action
to like to expand the action space for
to like to expand the action space for
it to
it to
determine how much dirt it's placing
determine how much dirt it's placing
along the square or like which rows it's
along the square or like which rows it's
going to be placing because if you're
going to be placing because if you're
just dropping like big old squares, it
just dropping like big old squares, it
makes it kind of harder to learn I feel
makes it kind of harder to learn I feel
like because you're losing granularity
like because you're losing granularity
with action. Like how do you going to
with action. Like how do you going to
make like a triangle if you only can
make like a triangle if you only can
drop squares?
triangle. Well, how many What is the Are
triangle. Well, how many What is the Are
you D Are you still dropping like 2 by
you D Are you still dropping like 2 by
two or 3 by3's? Like what are you
two or 3 by3's? Like what are you
dropping? I'm doing 5x5s right now.
dropping? I'm doing 5x5s right now.
Okay. So, they're moving a lot of dirt
Okay. So, they're moving a lot of dirt
at a time right now. Yeah, that's
at a time right now. Yeah, that's
fine. Are they actually able to like
fine. Are they actually able to like
flatten it despite that?
flatten it despite that?
Yeah, 100%. So, they've actually learned
Yeah, 100%. So, they've actually learned
like I have to line up this way. It's
like I have to line up this way. It's
able to entirely fully solve a quadrant
able to entirely fully solve a quadrant
on the map running around. It takes dirt
on the map running around. It takes dirt
from these mountains and then it it
from these mountains and then it it
basically spams running in a circle. Um,
basically spams running in a circle. Um,
and make sure that it actually makes
and make sure that it actually makes
sense, right? Because it's got to be
sense, right? Because it's got to be
like Well, I guess technically it can
like Well, I guess technically it can
shave like you don't have it can make it
shave like you don't have it can make it
can it doesn't have to make 10 x10s
can it doesn't have to make 10 x10s
despite having
despite having
So, the final goal is basically a what
So, the final goal is basically a what
is it?
is it?
uh 11 by 11 uhhuh for each quadrant
uh 11 by 11 uhhuh for each quadrant
because I just decide to match for
because I just decide to match for
vision and make things easier.
vision and make things easier.
Um in optimal policy of shaving those
Um in optimal policy of shaving those
layers, what it does is it's going to
layers, what it does is it's going to
place one and say it needs to go
place one and say it needs to go
somewhere else. So it'll it'll delete
somewhere else. So it'll it'll delete
the area that's excess and then place
the area that's excess and then place
again. Yeah. Okay. Well, if it's
again. Yeah. Okay. Well, if it's
actually learning that, man, like I
actually learning that, man, like I
think that How long do these runs take?
think that How long do these runs take?
They're they're really fast, right?
They're they're really fast, right?
Um, okay. Weird thing. I mean, on one
Um, okay. Weird thing. I mean, on one
machine they run at a million steps per
machine they run at a million steps per
second. On my base machine, they run at
second. On my base machine, they run at
like 500. So, I don't know why my
like 500. So, I don't know why my
machine's being an idiot, but on the
machine's being an idiot, but on the
buffer box, they run like 1 million. Um,
buffer box, they run like 1 million. Um,
so I they look like five minute runs.
so I they look like five minute runs.
They take like five minute runs
They take like five minute runs
effectively. Okay. So, I mean, I think
effectively. Okay. So, I mean, I think
then like literally if assuming the
then like literally if assuming the
hypers are still good, you should
hypers are still good, you should
probably quite quickly be able to just
probably quite quickly be able to just

Okay, does that work? Uh, okay. Can we
Okay, does that work? Uh, okay. Can we
like put some sort of simple structures
like put some sort of simple structures
on some of the plots? Right. Like you
on some of the plots? Right. Like you
should be able to get something like
should be able to get something like
that, I would think. Yeah. I mean, next
that, I would think. Yeah. I mean, next
thing will be the structured grid. I I

fine. They're they're all easily

happen to be enough dirt that like
roughly works out or what? Oh, I force I
roughly works out or what? Oh, I force I
force the dirt to be enough. Exactly.
force the dirt to be enough. Exactly.
Oh, okay. I do a scaling operation on
Oh, okay. I do a scaling operation on
the original map to equate to the amount
the original map to equate to the amount
of dirt that's needed on the target. All
of dirt that's needed on the target. All
right. Well, whatever. We'll deal with
right. Well, whatever. We'll deal with
the stuff later. I think like honestly,
the stuff later. I think like honestly,
so let's say that we have this thing and
so let's say that we have this thing and
it makes subdivisions and maybe like,
it makes subdivisions and maybe like,
you know, some basic simple structures

That should be enough to get some people

that. Um, cool. But yeah, for now, I
think just do some plots. I'm going to

try to figure out with this horribly

coming later today. So, that's what I'm
going to be working on for the next few
going to be working on for the next few

Yeah, once once you get sweeps going,
Yeah, once once you get sweeps going,
then I can drop it back on the GPU drive
then I can drop it back on the GPU drive
because right now it's getting the

resampled 99 is cursed. Yeah.
All right, I will see if I can figure.
Bye. That was fun.
Welcome folks on YouTube.
Welcome folks on YouTube.
pour myself more

uh we're going to figure out we got to
uh we're going to figure out we got to
figure out this
figure out this
sweep freaking nuts. We got to figure
sweep freaking nuts. We got to figure
out what's going wrong with it.
Got myself all wrapped up cuz I've got a

spend my time
spend my time
doing. Can't do one, do the other all

right. Right. So I was looking at the
right. Right. So I was looking at the
delta I
delta I
believe between this like ideal case
believe between this like ideal case
sweep and then the older
sweep. Not this one. This
one. The thing is it's
one. The thing is it's
like this narrows the gap quite a bit,
like this narrows the gap quite a bit,
doesn't
it? There is still a gap though.
It's like most of these runs are
It's like most of these runs are
shorter.
shorter.
No.
Yes. You know,
actually all the runs that discover 0.9
We have a filter on
this. I think I just have to color
this. I think I just have to color
match. So
like this one.
These all take a little longer, don't
These all take a little longer, don't
they? Then like eventually you
they? Then like eventually you
get 84
get 84

right? When we're looking at these first
right? When we're looking at these first
runs, the better
runs, the better

Yes. So maybe that is the problem.
Yes. So maybe that is the problem.
Maybe the core problem is around
time. I think that more than anything
time. I think that more than anything
that would make the most sense to me,
that would make the most sense to me,
right? that the core problem is around
right? that the core problem is around

right you need to run these longer

So, I guess what we have for now to look
So, I guess what we have for now to look
at, we've got the 200 run sweep from
at, we've got the 200 run sweep from
last
last
night and we have got the
uh the old sweep that was
good. Go to
sample and we'll see what params are
sample and we'll see what params are
weird looking.
Okay, gamma is a little bit
Okay, gamma is a little bit
low. The only really notable
low. The only really notable
thing, we do have samples though that
thing, we do have samples though that
are that high. They just don't work as
are that high. They just don't work as
well.
Fine. I just want to make sure like to
Fine. I just want to make sure like to
start that it is actually sampling
start that it is actually sampling
everywhere.
We are sampling
everywhere. Massive difference.
The total time steps thing is
like you know there is a difference but
like you know there is a difference but
we should be able to get the results
we should be able to get the results
even out here.
The mini batch sizes are like not that
The mini batch sizes are like not that
far off from each
other. Actually, this does better with
other. Actually, this does better with
32k.
is not finding the really ridiculous
is not finding the really ridiculous
small mini batch pram.
So, Adam beta
So, Adam beta
1 is notably too
low,
right? And then beta 2 is notably too
right? And then beta 2 is notably too
high.
Not really though, cuz this at least you
Not really though, cuz this at least you
have 0.9 Nat.
The only thing I've seen suspicious so
The only thing I've seen suspicious so
far is a few parameters that
far is a few parameters that
like the top end. It's not like getting
like the top end. It's not like getting
all the way to the top
And maybe This is telling here. Maybe

this is

results, two
results, two
environments, or two
2x496. The one that's good. And this
2x496. The one that's good. And this
one's only doing half.
You know
what? Isn't this kind of
close? Like with one O, it's like
close? Like with one O, it's like
spending a lot of time on one
spending a lot of time on one
environment here and that matches with
environment here and that matches with
this.
Not spending enough time on
this.
this.
The
The
angel is Mary.
That's the biggest
That's the biggest
like that's the biggest smoking gun we
like that's the biggest smoking gun we
found so far.
But the question is like Bye.
go take a look at the latest sweep.
Okay. So this is 100
runs that I know is running the correct
runs that I know is running the correct
mini batch and everything.
do the exact same thing I was doing
before. Got the learning rate too
low. Well, the best run is O1. It does
low. Well, the best run is O1. It does
have O1, so it's a little skewed, but
have O1, so it's a little skewed, but
it's not
it's not
bad. Got gamma. Gamma is still too low.
bad. Got gamma. Gamma is still too low.
Okay. So now this is two in a row for
Okay. So now this is two in a row for
gamma's too low.
gamma's too low.
Lambda.
This I've equated for and I' I've run
This I've equated for and I' I've run
multiple tests, so don't worry about
that. Got over here for a bit so I can
actually track of it.
86% is our
86% is our
best 97.
Okay.
Okay.
So having looked at
everything, the
only thing that is consistently off is
only thing that is consistently off is
gamma. If we look at gamma up top,
thing is you can get 90
thing is you can get 90
score even with gamma
of.98 but I'm not that far off from
of.98 but I'm not that far off from
that. The thing is in order to get
that. The thing is in order to get
higher than
that.9 do

here. Right.
There's a big cluster of good runs above
0.9. If we go back to like the point 8,
0.9. If we go back to like the point 8,
we're fighting
over. No, there's still a gap. I think
over. No, there's still a gap. I think
there is still a gap.
Even with gamma being
Even with gamma being
set, it's weird that it doesn't go up to

right? Pretty substantial
one. Got to keep in mind the

count.

Or no, I'm going to count, but I'm going
Or no, I'm going to count, but I'm going
to count more smart. I'm going to count
to count more smart. I'm going to count
smarter than this.
how I'm going to
count now the last page. Oh, be the
count now the last page. Oh, be the
first page that I go
first page that I go
to. They're disabling runs.
Okay, this is what this looks like here.
We only get two
We only get two
runs, three runs above
runs, three runs above
0.9 in the first

Here we get
Here we get
zero. We get a whole bunch that are
zero. We get a whole bunch that are
above 08 in both
It's so weird to me. Like, this is such
It's so weird to me. Like, this is such
strong evidence. Hey,
strong evidence. Hey,
Spencer, I'm trying to fix sweeps. I can

Looks like you got some results.
Yo.

If I fix this bug, I deserve to be

Oh, that's funny. This is like so
Oh, that's funny. This is like so
cursed, but it looks like you've been
cursed, but it looks like you've been
getting results in the meantime.
getting results in the meantime.
Is there any is there any hope anymore
Is there any is there any hope anymore
right now or is it uh pretty cursed at
right now or is it uh pretty cursed at
the moment? I've run the same version of
the moment? I've run the same version of
the code.
Um, like I checked out the original
Um, like I checked out the original
branch, I ran a full sweep and there's
branch, I ran a full sweep and there's
like a 2x error
gap and it looks like the distribution
gap and it looks like the distribution
of hypers is very similar
of hypers is very similar
across. I've like run a whole bunch of

follow-ups. I've like
follow-ups. I've like
checked that the transcript is
checked that the transcript is
identical. I've checked that the sweep

Well, in some degree of positive news,
Well, in some degree of positive news,
the terraforming stuff is seemingly
the terraforming stuff is seemingly
working now. Awesome. Um, it's not

Yeah, I'm I'm running um it's really
Yeah, I'm I'm running um it's really
annoying because I can't actually find

Okay. I I just have GD I'm just running
Okay. I I just have GD I'm just running
the GDB with the train right now. It
the GDB with the train right now. It
takes forever to train with like you can
takes forever to train with like you can
do that. And if if that doesn't work
do that. And if if that doesn't work
though, what I would do is I'd get like
though, what I would do is I'd get like
a checkpoint that's close to where it
a checkpoint that's close to where it
crashes and resume training on that
crashes and resume training on that
checkpoint like load model path or
checkpoint like load model path or
whatever. I think should be enough. Um,
whatever. I think should be enough. Um,
is that a is that a thing right now in
is that a is that a thing right now in
the buffer RL? I've never done load from
the buffer RL? I've never done load from
checkpoint on resume from training. Is
checkpoint on resume from training. Is
that we can load a model. We we don't
that we can load a model. We we don't
load the optimizer state at the moment,
load the optimizer state at the moment,
but we do load the

model. So it should at least do
something.
something.
Okay. Well, hopefully this is just on

this run it will uh hopefully and how

um I linked the sweep in the dev channel
um I linked the sweep in the dev channel
back in it
and it is able to solve quadrants.
And that is randomly assigned quadrants
And that is randomly assigned quadrants
right now just with one car running
right now just with one car running
around trying to find that it's its
around trying to find that it's its
target quadrant or is higher when you
target quadrant or is higher when you
run for
run for
longer. Um but it doesn't look like
longer. Um but it doesn't look like
quadrants is
quadrants is
so the quadrant progress is as gets
so the quadrant progress is as gets
reset every time you pick up a new
reset every time you pick up a new
quadrant. So that's why that number gets
quadrant. So that's why that number gets
doesn't like peak to like 99 is because
doesn't like peak to like 99 is because
that it averages down as you solve
that it averages down as you solve
quadrants.
So score is probably the most accurate
So score is probably the most accurate
metric of like legit success because
metric of like legit success because
when I ran eval with, you know, turning
when I ran eval with, you know, turning
off any form of resets, it's able to
off any form of resets, it's able to
solve like 15 to eight 15 to 20
solve like 15 to eight 15 to 20
quadrants just if you just let it run
forever. Oh, it found it found an issue.
forever. Oh, it found it found an issue.
Okay, solid.
I I've been posting some stuff just so
I I've been posting some stuff just so
we get them. Like I think that we should
we get them. Like I think that we should
try When did we sign the thing? Was it
try When did we sign the thing? Was it
like the 8th or the 9th? Uh the eighth.
like the 8th or the 9th? Uh the eighth.
Okay. I think that we should try to like
Okay. I think that we should try to like
just have barely started a thing on QD
just have barely started a thing on QD
for them in the next few days because uh
for them in the next few days because uh
that will increase the odds of renewal.
Oh, you want to start doing is that what
Oh, you want to start doing is that what
their next task is? Yeah.
their next task is? Yeah.
I mean, as you can see, it's like they
I mean, as you can see, it's like they
just like we package it for them very
just like we package it for them very
very easily and they just don't get to
very easily and they just don't get to
get around to like using it for quite a
get around to like using it for quite a
while. But yeah, I mean, at least this
while. But yeah, I mean, at least this
time like you can't they can't say like,
time like you can't they can't say like,
"Oh, it was too hard or whatever to like
"Oh, it was too hard or whatever to like
it's we we've actually done it like
it's we we've actually done it like
we've done a very very good job I think
we've done a very very good job I think
this time on it." Just like Yeah.
B this
bot can look at it next, you know, next
bot can look at it next, you know, next
week and then close out this this round,
week and then close out this this round,
this contract and then see if we'll look
this contract and then see if we'll look
at renewals. Yeah, they should. I mean,
at renewals. Yeah, they should. I mean,
based on what we've delivered, I like I
based on what we've delivered, I like I
can't see how they'll be like, now we
can't see how they'll be like, now we
got it from here.
Yeah. I mean, we pretty much just
Yeah. I mean, we pretty much just
steamrolled whatever was there before.
steamrolled whatever was there before.
which is how it should go generally when
which is how it should go generally when
we don't have crazy bugs. Like our core
we don't have crazy bugs. Like our core
tech is just that like it's that good
tech is just that like it's that good
now that we should just be able to do
now that we should just be able to do
that. A lot of value add just being like
that. A lot of value add just being like
the ones who have been developing the
the ones who have been developing the
stuff and knowing how to make it sing.
stuff and knowing how to make it sing.
Yeah. I mean the the next step that I
Yeah. I mean the the next step that I
think even with doing QD is just also
think even with doing QD is just also
having like proper train test split
having like proper train test split
evals while it trains.
evals while it trains.
Mhm. So, we'll discuss that and then we
Mhm. So, we'll discuss that and then we
can we can discuss privately offstream
can we can discuss privately offstream
whether you want to like continue stuff
whether you want to like continue stuff
with that and like know like depending
with that and like know like depending
on what they propose next and how that's
on what they propose next and how that's
going. But I think it's a pretty small
going. But I think it's a pretty small
amount of work for having a a like
amount of work for having a a like
deliver some pretty good results. I
deliver some pretty good results. I
think it's a pretty good setup at the
think it's a pretty good setup at the
moment. Yeah, like most the other
moment. Yeah, like most the other
clients the other clients Yeah, the
clients the other clients Yeah, the
other clients are like substantially
other clients are like substantially
more work to be able to add that amount
more work to be able to add that amount
of value. But yeah, we'll talk that. Um,
of value. But yeah, we'll talk that. Um,
okay. But back on stream on Terraform.
okay. But back on stream on Terraform.
So, here's the things that I'm changing
So, here's the things that I'm changing
right now. Um, knowing that it can solve
right now. Um, knowing that it can solve
uh quadrants. Uhhuh.
uh quadrants. Uhhuh.
What it does at the moment, which is
What it does at the moment, which is
kind of funny because it is optimal, but
kind of funny because it is optimal, but
it's not being punished for it, is every
it's not being punished for it, is every
time it solves a quadrant,
time it solves a quadrant,
it actually takes a scoop out of the
it actually takes a scoop out of the
quadrant it just solved to bring it to
quadrant it just solved to bring it to
the new target quadrant.
the new target quadrant.
That's funny.
That's funny.
So, I'm adding in, you know, mechanics
So, I'm adding in, you know, mechanics
to punish it from touching complete
to punish it from touching complete
quadrants.
quadrants.
That's actually so funny.
That's actually so funny.
Which I was like, god damn it. Like, why
Which I was like, god damn it. Like, why
are you exploiting this? Because the RL
are you exploiting this? Because the RL
is just good, man.
is just good, man.
Um, I I found one bug that is a little
Um, I I found one bug that is a little
annoying that's only related to doing
annoying that's only related to doing
quadrant work. So, I did want to talk
quadrant work. So, I did want to talk
with you about like is
with you about like is
their additional benefit at this point
their additional benefit at this point
knowing that it can solve quadrants the
knowing that it can solve quadrants the
way I've you know set up the reward
way I've you know set up the reward
engineering to treat it as a problem of
engineering to treat it as a problem of
you know perfectly solving all quadrants
you know perfectly solving all quadrants
on the map or letting it just try and
on the map or letting it just try and
solve all map
because when you solve like all
because when you solve like all
quadrants you have to do like a little
quadrants you have to do like a little
bit more of checks on like you're not
bit more of checks on like you're not
screwing with previous quadrants you
screwing with previous quadrants you
know you're you're as you're changing
know you're you're as you're changing
the world your targets in Those
the world your targets in Those
quadrants are
quadrants are
modified. Like you could pull from
modified. Like you could pull from
somewhere and then that current now like
somewhere and then that current now like
the problem you gave it originally is
the problem you gave it originally is
now different than when you spawn the
now different than when you spawn the
world.
I'm sorry. My brain just ignored all
I'm sorry. My brain just ignored all
like just like all those words did not
like just like all those words did not
like what would you what' you say?
like what would you what' you say?
So I'm trying
So I'm trying
to think about is it better
to think about is it better
to do this kind of quadrant centric
to do this kind of quadrant centric
learning. Uhhuh. Where you you know you
learning. Uhhuh. Where you you know you
solve all the quadrants on the map and
solve all the quadrants on the map and
then you solve the whole map or just
then you solve the whole map or just
solve all map. It is but there are some
solve all map. It is but there are some
like more complex dynamics when you have
like more complex dynamics when you have
to deal with quadrants.
to deal with quadrants.
Why are there more complex dynamics?
Um you have to and I mean this is just
Um you have to and I mean this is just
like in there. I don't think it's like
like in there. I don't think it's like
that big a deal. It's more like it as
that big a deal. It's more like it as
you're running around the world, right,
you're running around the world, right,
you are taking things from other
you are taking things from other
quadrants to in order to optimize your
quadrants to in order to optimize your
single quadrant, right? Oh, yeah. And
single quadrant, right? Oh, yeah. And
when you do that, when you when you set
when you do that, when you when you set
up the original of just solving all map
up the original of just solving all map
and only care about all map, it doesn't
and only care about all map, it doesn't
matter what you do in the meantime
matter what you do in the meantime
because you still have one
because you still have one
like original delta to go off of. like
like original delta to go off of. like
the world spawned like this and you need
the world spawned like this and you need
to take it to this. When you're dealing
to take it to this. When you're dealing
with quadrants, each quadrant's little
with quadrants, each quadrant's little
micro world gets modified throughout the
micro world gets modified throughout the
entire time until you become until it
entire time until you become until it
becomes the
target. I wouldn't worry too much
target. I wouldn't worry too much
because like we already have a bigger
because like we already have a bigger
map than they're going to need, don't
map than they're going to need, don't
we? I guess it depends what resolution
we? I guess it depends what resolution
we're assuming the simulation is running
we're assuming the simulation is running
at. Um yeah, I mean I dropped it to 64
at. Um yeah, I mean I dropped it to 64
by 64 just to like kind of get it.
by 64 just to like kind of get it.
What's a quadrant then?
Um 121 11 by 11s
because I just match it with the vision.
because I just match it with the vision.
Oh, so if it's like 11 by 11 like So I
Oh, so if it's like 11 by 11 like So I
mean you could say it's 1 meter by you
mean you could say it's 1 meter by you
could say it's 10, you know, 11 meters
could say it's 10, you know, 11 meters
by 11 meters if you wanted to. Yeah.
by 11 meters if you wanted to. Yeah.
Well, assuming we're doing like the
Well, assuming we're doing like the
granularity of it's like a very coarse
granularity of it's like a very coarse
sim, right? But yeah, I mean if you I
sim, right? But yeah, I mean if you I
mean it really just depends on what
mean it really just depends on what
number you pick. I mean to some degree
number you pick. I mean to some degree
it's irrelevant. If it can solve, if it
it's irrelevant. If it can solve, if it
can solve, you know, a total amount of,
can solve, you know, a total amount of,
you know, 4,000 quadrants on 64x 64, I
you know, 4,000 quadrants on 64x 64, I
see no reason why it couldn't solve, you
see no reason why it couldn't solve, you
know, 5,000
know, 5,000
quadrants or 10,000. Yeah, I think it's
quadrants or 10,000. Yeah, I think it's
a fine it's a fine way to go for now,
a fine it's a fine way to go for now,
especially like we
especially like we
probably the more I like think about
probably the more I like think about
what is the best way to go with these
what is the best way to go with these
Sims, right? the more I think I the more
Sims, right? the more I think I the more
I'm thinking like the best the first
I'm thinking like the best the first
thing we want to do is just like get
thing we want to do is just like get
something cool that roughly looks like
something cool that roughly looks like
the problem and then the details of
the problem and then the details of
those like let's actually get the
those like let's actually get the
contracts right before we put all the
contracts right before we put all the
effort the like all the details of it um
effort the like all the details of it um
just so that you know we actually have
just so that you know we actually have
something going with that. I'm kind of
something going with that. I'm kind of
going to do the same thing on the new
going to do the same thing on the new
sim that I'm working on.
sim that I'm working on.
Um, I think that's probably the main
Um, I think that's probably the main
thing. So, like, have you seen the
thing. So, like, have you seen the
policies lately? Do they look cool?
policies lately? Do they look cool?
Like,
Like,
what? Yeah. No, I mean, they work. You
what? Yeah. No, I mean, they work. You
know, it's pulling dirt from places.
know, it's pulling dirt from places.
It's it's flattening it out. I mean, I
It's it's flattening it out. I mean, I
haven't done to pllin to pear yet.
haven't done to pllin to pear yet.
Um, right now it's going pearl to random
Um, right now it's going pearl to random
flats, but what's random flats?
flats, but what's random flats?
What's up? Can you make it like
What's up? Can you make it like
structured flats so it looks interesting
structured flats so it looks interesting
at least? Like so you like you make your
at least? Like so you like you make your
like Didn't you say that it's basically
like Didn't you say that it's basically
just like a bunch of pads or whatever
just like a bunch of pads or whatever
that you build? Yeah.
that you build? Yeah.
So can you do something like that? I
So can you do something like that? I
could do structured flats. I mean I I
could do structured flats. I mean I I
could make it a grid of
could make it a grid of
flats as opposed to just the whole thing
flats as opposed to just the whole thing
flat.
Well, like a grid of flats. It's like
Well, like a grid of flats. It's like
there's like a divot. So they'd
there's like a divot. So they'd
basically have like a walkway in between
basically have like a walkway in between
the plots or whatever is. Yeah, that's
the plots or whatever is. Yeah, that's
how it would look. It would look like a
how it would look. It would look like a
bunch of lots effectively. Lots. Yeah,
bunch of lots effectively. Lots. Yeah,
that would be decent. I think the other
that would be decent. I think the other
thing that you could do if we wanted to
thing that you could do if we wanted to
be slightly fancier is like we could
be slightly fancier is like we could
like I don't know just come up with some
like I don't know just come up with some
structures to like randomly assign,
structures to like randomly assign,
right? So we could make it like, oh
right? So we could make it like, oh
yeah, builds a pyramid in some of them.
yeah, builds a pyramid in some of them.
It builds like a cube in others. It like
It builds like a cube in others. It like
flattens like whatever. And then it
flattens like whatever. And then it
would just be really freaking obvious.
would just be really freaking obvious.
Yeah. Yeah, I mean you could do a whole
Yeah. Yeah, I mean you could do a whole
bunch of things. I mean at a at a next
bunch of things. I mean at a at a next
immediate step for sure I could do like
immediate step for sure I could do like
a structured grid that looks like an
a structured grid that looks like an
actual like subdivision. See if that
actual like subdivision. See if that
works. I think see if that works first
works. I think see if that works first
like some subdivisions and then we can
like some subdivisions and then we can
see if like we want to have them build
see if like we want to have them build
some stuff on the subdivisions, right?
some stuff on the subdivisions, right?
Yeah. Yeah, I mean the only thing that
Yeah. Yeah, I mean the only thing that
becomes complex there is I think you
becomes complex there is I think you
I'll have to start adding another action
I'll have to start adding another action
to like to expand the action space for
to like to expand the action space for
it to
it to
determine how much dirt it's placing
determine how much dirt it's placing
along the square or like which rows it's
along the square or like which rows it's
going to be placing because if you're
going to be placing because if you're
just dropping like big old squares, it
just dropping like big old squares, it
makes it kind of harder to learn I feel
makes it kind of harder to learn I feel
like because you're losing granularity
like because you're losing granularity
with action. Like how do you going to
with action. Like how do you going to
make like a triangle if you only can
make like a triangle if you only can
drop squares?
triangle. Well, how many What is the Are
triangle. Well, how many What is the Are
you D Are you still dropping like 2 by
you D Are you still dropping like 2 by
two or 3 by3's? Like what are you
two or 3 by3's? Like what are you
dropping? I'm doing 5x5s right now.
dropping? I'm doing 5x5s right now.
Okay. So, they're moving a lot of dirt
Okay. So, they're moving a lot of dirt
at a time right now. Yeah, that's
at a time right now. Yeah, that's
fine. Are they actually able to like
fine. Are they actually able to like
flatten it despite that?
flatten it despite that?
Yeah, 100%. So, they've actually learned
Yeah, 100%. So, they've actually learned
like I have to line up this way. It's
like I have to line up this way. It's
able to entirely fully solve a quadrant
able to entirely fully solve a quadrant
on the map running around. It takes dirt
on the map running around. It takes dirt
from these mountains and then it it
from these mountains and then it it
basically spams running in a circle. Um,
basically spams running in a circle. Um,
and make sure that it actually makes
and make sure that it actually makes
sense, right? Because it's got to be
sense, right? Because it's got to be
like Well, I guess technically it can
like Well, I guess technically it can
shave like you don't have it can make it
shave like you don't have it can make it
can it doesn't have to make 10 x10s
can it doesn't have to make 10 x10s
despite having
despite having
So, the final goal is basically a what
So, the final goal is basically a what
is it?
is it?
uh 11 by 11 uhhuh for each quadrant
uh 11 by 11 uhhuh for each quadrant
because I just decide to match for
because I just decide to match for
vision and make things easier.
vision and make things easier.
Um in optimal policy of shaving those
Um in optimal policy of shaving those
layers, what it does is it's going to
layers, what it does is it's going to
place one and say it needs to go
place one and say it needs to go
somewhere else. So it'll it'll delete
somewhere else. So it'll it'll delete
the area that's excess and then place
the area that's excess and then place
again. Yeah. Okay. Well, if it's
again. Yeah. Okay. Well, if it's
actually learning that, man, like I
actually learning that, man, like I
think that How long do these runs take?
think that How long do these runs take?
They're they're really fast, right?
They're they're really fast, right?
Um, okay. Weird thing. I mean, on one
Um, okay. Weird thing. I mean, on one
machine they run at a million steps per
machine they run at a million steps per
second. On my base machine, they run at
second. On my base machine, they run at
like 500. So, I don't know why my
like 500. So, I don't know why my
machine's being an idiot, but on the
machine's being an idiot, but on the
buffer box, they run like 1 million. Um,
buffer box, they run like 1 million. Um,
so I they look like five minute runs.
so I they look like five minute runs.
They take like five minute runs
They take like five minute runs
effectively. Okay. So, I mean, I think
effectively. Okay. So, I mean, I think
then like literally if assuming the

hypers are still good, you should
hypers are still good, you should
probably quite quickly be able to just
probably quite quickly be able to just

like, yeah, what if it does does plots?
Okay, does that work? Uh, okay. Can we
Okay, does that work? Uh, okay. Can we
like put some sort of simple structures
like put some sort of simple structures
on some of the plots? Right. Like you
on some of the plots? Right. Like you
should be able to get something like
should be able to get something like
that, I would think. Yeah. I mean, next
that, I would think. Yeah. I mean, next
thing will be the structured grid. I I
thing will be the structured grid. I I
need to clean up this seg fault, which

and then just deal with the the small
and then just deal with the the small

deltas in the beginning. But that's
deltas in the beginning. But that's
fine. They're they're all easily
fine. They're they're all easily
solvable things. It's just tracking the
solvable things. It's just tracking the
arrays properly.

And does there like does there just

happen to be enough dirt that like
happen to be enough dirt that like
roughly works out or what? Oh, I force I
roughly works out or what? Oh, I force I
force the dirt to be enough. Exactly.
force the dirt to be enough. Exactly.
Oh, okay. I do a scaling operation on
Oh, okay. I do a scaling operation on
the original map to equate to the amount
the original map to equate to the amount
of dirt that's needed on the target. All
of dirt that's needed on the target. All
right. Well, whatever. We'll deal with
right. Well, whatever. We'll deal with
the stuff later. I think like honestly,
the stuff later. I think like honestly,
so let's say that we have this thing and
so let's say that we have this thing and
it makes subdivisions and maybe like,
it makes subdivisions and maybe like,
you know, some basic simple structures
you know, some basic simple structures
on the subdivisions. Like maybe it will
on the subdivisions. Like maybe it will
like make like a ramp on some of them or
like make like a ramp on some of them or
like put like a big cube in the middle
like put like a big cube in the middle
on like some others. Even like simple
on like some others. Even like simple
stuff, not even like complicated shapes.
stuff, not even like complicated shapes.
That should be enough to get some people
That should be enough to get some people
in industry excited, wouldn't you think?
in industry excited, wouldn't you think?
I would think so. I mean, it's
I would think so. I mean, it's
just in this industry, you're going to
just in this industry, you're going to
be looking at
like there's probably gonna I don't know
like there's probably gonna I don't know
how much indust interest on industry
how much indust interest on industry
there's going to be from the actual big
there's going to be from the actual big
players but there may be
players but there may be
yeah we have to we got to figure out how
yeah we have to we got to figure out how
we like how
we like how
we how we going to pitch or package it
we how we going to pitch or package it
right because it's like we can't just
right because it's like we can't just
plug it into their thing and just
plug it into their thing and just
immediately have it run on the dozers
immediately have it run on the dozers
right no I mean I think this is really
right no I mean I think this is really
hyper specific just for those those two
hyper specific just for those those two
guys that we talked with. Okay. Well,
guys that we talked with. Okay. Well,
and then what we should do is we should
and then what we should do is we should
think about what what other problems out
think about what what other problems out
even in different industries, right?
even in different industries, right?
This sim kind of looks like. Correct.
This sim kind of looks like. Correct.
Right. So, we can talk about that later
Right. So, we can talk about that later
um off stream as well cuz like pretty
um off stream as well cuz like pretty
much my goal for the next I have to get
much my goal for the next I have to get
3 out and I keep I like this should have
3 out and I keep I like this should have
been done weeks ago, but I've like I've
been done weeks ago, but I've like I've
hit every freaking demonic horrendous
hit every freaking demonic horrendous
problem in the book. Um, but that aside,
problem in the book. Um, but that aside,
the main goal I I think is I want to do
the main goal I I think is I want to do
more sim work. So, I want to get more
more sim work. So, I want to get more
into Simside stuff with you. And I want
into Simside stuff with you. And I want
to just make a bunch of like things that
to just make a bunch of like things that
could apply to a bunch of places in the
could apply to a bunch of places in the
industry and figure out how we translate
industry and figure out how we translate
that into swinging a couple big
that into swinging a couple big
contracts because if I do that then like
contracts because if I do that then like
the scaling problem for Puffer and like
the scaling problem for Puffer and like
all the servers and all the compute and
all the servers and all the compute and
like you know even potentially getting
like you know even potentially getting
us some help on like this that's all
us some help on like this that's all
just solved if we can do that.
Yeah, that would be ideal.
Yeah, that would be ideal.
I mean, there may be room for like
I mean, there may be room for like
groups like Caterpillar that want to
groups like Caterpillar that want to
play around with this. Um, or like that
play around with this. Um, or like that
would be a big one. Yeah, like that
would be a big one. Yeah, like that
would be like a really solid size.
would be like a really solid size.
Like the farming world could be
Like the farming world could be
interested in things like this. I mean,
interested in things like this. I mean,
I could ask the farmer who's here
I could ask the farmer who's here
driving
driving
around. Oh.
I don't know how much they do like
I don't know how much they do like
terraforming and stuff. They they like
terraforming and stuff. They they like
have like the vision stuff for um
have like the vision stuff for um
killing weeds. There's actually there's
killing weeds. There's actually there's
the guy on one of the guys on the
the guy on one of the guys on the
Pokemon paper does that.
Pokemon paper does that.
Oh yeah. Yeah. We got to just find
Oh yeah. Yeah. We got to just find
problems though where it's like this is
problems though where it's like this is
valuable and it's not shoehorned, right?
valuable and it's not shoehorned, right?
It's like ah yes, this is clearly a
It's like ah yes, this is clearly a
thing where RL can help. Not like we
thing where RL can help. Not like we
have a a hammer and everything looks
have a a hammer and everything looks
like a nail because it's really really
like a nail because it's really really
powerful tech. We just have to figure
powerful tech. We just have to figure
out where to match it now that we
out where to match it now that we
actually have it working.
actually have it working.
Yeah. Either way, I think this will be a
Yeah. Either way, I think this will be a
cool industry sim that will at least be
cool industry sim that will at least be
good to look at and I think we have
good to look at and I think we have
possibly two people one I'd say at least
possibly two people one I'd say at least
80% sure would probably want to go
80% sure would probably want to go
forward. Yeah. Are you interested in
forward. Yeah. Are you interested in
building out your own like presence in
building out your own like presence in
this space? Because I mean it's a really
this space? Because I mean it's a really
good formula for this is like building
good formula for this is like building
these like building these awesome
these like building these awesome
things, positioning them reasonably,

doing a little write up and like putting

thing. That's what I've been doing at
thing. That's what I've been doing at
least.

Yeah. I mean, I I think I want to, you
Yeah. I mean, I I think I want to, you
know, be able to build out, you know,
know, be able to build out, you know,
some of these contracts and build out
some of these contracts and build out
and build out a presence online of being
and build out a presence online of being
like the guy who's able to build these
like the guy who's able to build these
industry sims. All right. All right.
industry sims. All right. All right.
Well, we'll talk about how we how we do
Well, we'll talk about how we how we do
that. Um, cool. But yeah, for now, I
that. Um, cool. But yeah, for now, I
think just do some plots. I'm going to
think just do some plots. I'm going to
try to figure out with this horribly
try to figure out with this horribly
cursed sweep stuff. I also have uh the
cursed sweep stuff. I also have uh the
cables and things I need
cables and things I need
to figure out if I can get their tiny
to figure out if I can get their tiny
boxes set up correctly. I got those
boxes set up correctly. I got those
coming later today. So, that's what I'm
coming later today. So, that's what I'm
going to be working on for the next few
going to be working on for the next few
hours.
hours.
Yeah, once once you get sweeps going,
Yeah, once once you get sweeps going,
then I can drop it back on the GPU drive
then I can drop it back on the GPU drive
because right now it's getting the
because right now it's getting the
resampled 99 is cursed. Yeah.
resampled 99 is cursed. Yeah.
All right, I will see if I can figure.
Bye. That was fun.
Welcome folks on YouTube.
Welcome folks on YouTube.
pour myself more
pour myself more
coffee and then
coffee and then
uh we're going to figure out we got to
uh we're going to figure out we got to
figure out this
figure out this
sweep freaking nuts. We got to figure
sweep freaking nuts. We got to figure
out what's going wrong with it.
Got myself all wrapped up cuz I've got a
Got myself all wrapped up cuz I've got a
a bad
a bad
knee. Trying to keep it
warm. Hurt a shoulder. Hurt a knee. So,
warm. Hurt a shoulder. Hurt a knee. So,
can't really do much exercise. May as
can't really do much exercise. May as
well code all
well code all
day and fix
day and fix
experiments. Those are the two things I
experiments. Those are the two things I
spend my time
spend my time
doing. Can't do one, do the other all
doing. Can't do one, do the other all
day. All
right. Right. So I was looking at the
right. Right. So I was looking at the
delta I
delta I
believe between this like ideal case
believe between this like ideal case
sweep and then the older
sweep. Not this one. This
one. The thing is it's
one. The thing is it's
like this narrows the gap quite a bit,
like this narrows the gap quite a bit,
doesn't
it? There is still a gap though.
It's like most of these runs are
It's like most of these runs are
shorter.
shorter.
No.
Yes. You know,
actually all the runs that discover 0.9
We have a filter on
this. I think I just have to color
this. I think I just have to color
match. So
like this one.
These all take a little longer, don't
These all take a little longer, don't
they? Then like eventually you
they? Then like eventually you
get 84
get 84

100. This one's just really good. This
100. This one's just really good. This
But it it even this one, this is 270 mil
But it it even this one, this is 270 mil
steps,
steps,
right? When we're looking at these first
right? When we're looking at these first
runs, the better
runs, the better
runs are taking more
steps.
steps.
Yes. So maybe that is the problem.
Yes. So maybe that is the problem.
Maybe the core problem is around
time. I think that more than anything
time. I think that more than anything
that would make the most sense to me,
that would make the most sense to me,
right? that the core problem is around
right? that the core problem is around
time and the thing just not running long
time and the thing just not running long
enough
enough
experiments because the thing is
right you need to run these longer
right you need to run these longer
experiments to see what run like what
experiments to see what run like what
parameters are stable and such and like

that can actually help you find
that can actually help you find

parameters that are shorter and good and
that's not happening on the left
now That's a very strong lead. That is a

very strong
lead. And that is consistent with all of
lead. And that is consistent with all of
the repro experiments so
far. When are you taking us to
far. When are you taking us to
Mars? Uh, well, I'm not taking us to
Mars? Uh, well, I'm not taking us to
Mars until we terraform it. We're
