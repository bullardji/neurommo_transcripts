Work on some drone stuff today.
Why is my reream bot doing that?
That's weird. We'll see if it keeps

doing that. That's obnoxious. All right.
doing that. That's obnoxious. All right.
So, this is the hover task. And see it's
So, this is the hover task. And see it's
pretty good, Okay.
I'd be confused if it can't do the flag
I'd be confused if it can't do the flag
task, but it can do the cover task,

right?
Morning, chicken. Uh, yeah, Reream did

some jank stuff. Hang on.
Why? Why did you

Is there a thing where like people don't

Just got introduced to reinforcement
Just got introduced to reinforcement

follow them to the tea.
follow them to the tea.
I will show you.

with all of my best advice.
with all of my best advice.
It's like the most common question I

get.
Hey, Anick.
All right. So, if you just go here on X,
All right. So, if you just go here on X,

read this even if you're like not that
read this even if you're like not that
new. I as well. These two together have

all my best advice.
all my best advice.
And it's like a step by-step. Do this,
And it's like a step by-step. Do this,
do this, do this, do this. Now you know
do this, do this, do this. Now you know
how to research. Good.
Pretty short thing, too. Like,
Pretty short thing, too. Like,
if you have AI fundamentals and
if you have AI fundamentals and
programming fundamentals, you can do

this stuff in like a couple of weeks,
this stuff in like a couple of weeks,
and you'll actually contribute useful
and you'll actually contribute useful
things along the way before you get into

like the hard research stuff.
Okay. How's this work?
Okay. How's this work?
This is a bad score, I'm pretty sure.
This is a bad score, I'm pretty sure.
This a bad score?
Yeah, this is a bad score. Okay.
Yeah, this is a bad score. Okay.
Huh?
I noticed entropy is almost all of your
I noticed entropy is almost all of your
Wait, I noticed entropy.
You mean you notice entropy? Like the
You mean you notice entropy? Like the
fact that there is an entropy term? You
fact that there is an entropy term? You
can quantify that for not PO. Um, we
can quantify that for not PO. Um, we
don't actually use PO. Our algorithm is
don't actually use PO. Our algorithm is
based on PO, but it's meaningfully more
based on PO, but it's meaningfully more
advanced, like a generational
advanced, like a generational
improvement. And entropy really is not a
improvement. And entropy really is not a
big part of the algorithm. Like, it
big part of the algorithm. Like, it
matters a lot in some environments, but
matters a lot in some environments, but
I wouldn't even put it in like the top
I wouldn't even put it in like the top
five most important things about PO
or about our algorithm, at least about
or about our algorithm, at least about
our algorithm. Maybe in the top five
our algorithm. Maybe in the top five
about PO, but not about our algorithm.
All of our new algorithm research and
All of our new algorithm research and
stuff is public as well. Like not only
stuff is public as well. Like not only
is the code public, but I have writeups
is the code public, but I have writeups
on everything if you want to learn about
on everything if you want to learn about
our algorithms.
Oh,
Oh,
hang on. Did I do this wrong?
See if that makes a difference.
I would like to figure out how to
I would like to figure out how to
disable.
How do I disable that? Like respot
How do I disable that? Like respot
broadcasting everything like that.
broadcasting everything like that.
That's super annoying.
Oh, wait. Here. I found it. Hang on. Let
Oh, wait. Here. I found it. Hang on. Let
me fix that, guys.
All
right, that does it. Hard to read them
right, that does it. Hard to read them
recently. I'll use puff lip for my
recently. I'll use puff lip for my
thesis and awesome.
Okay, this is totally different. So I
Okay, this is totally different. So I
think what happened this is very silly
think what happened this is very silly
is I just I literally just had run the
is I just I literally just had run the
wrong command before. Uh I think this is
wrong command before. Uh I think this is
not perfect still.
not perfect still.
I'll have to let this finish and we'll
I'll have to let this finish and we'll
copy this policy and we'll see if it
copy this policy and we'll see if it
makes the flag or not.
I have a whole bunch of cool projects
I have a whole bunch of cool projects
lined up uh to do on stream
lined up uh to do on stream
the next like several weeks.
the next like several weeks.
We'll see how long it takes me to get to
We'll see how long it takes me to get to
everything because like I have a whole
everything because like I have a whole
bunch of meetings in SF this week. Then
bunch of meetings in SF this week. Then
I got to get ready for RLC, the RLC
I got to get ready for RLC, the RLC
conference.
conference.
Got to present Puffer Lib. Got to make
Got to present Puffer Lib. Got to make
the poster and stuff for that as well.
the poster and stuff for that as well.
And then um
And then um
we'll see if there's any like business
we'll see if there's any like business
side stuff off of that.
side stuff off of that.
And then once I'm back, I'll be able to
And then once I'm back, I'll be able to
probably start cranking on some things.
probably start cranking on some things.
Oh yeah, this PF looks way better.
That's probably doing the flag, right?
We'll always like visualize to be sure,
We'll always like visualize to be sure,
but I think the process here is going to
but I think the process here is going to
be like make sure that the tasks work,
be like make sure that the tasks work,
make sure the tasks work randomized,
make sure the tasks work randomized,
then try to do them jointly.
Why does it auto complete that? That's
Why does it auto complete that? That's
so weird.
Oh.
But this is
all right. Let's see what this does.
all right. Let's see what this does.
American
American
flag.
Yep. American flag.
Yep. American flag.
Solid, right?
Solid, right?
American flag in drones.
American flag in drones.
And that is satisfying.
And that is satisfying.
Not fully perfect. I can fix that up
Not fully perfect. I can fix that up
though over time. I can always fine-tune
though over time. I can always fine-tune
task works.
All right, next thing.
So, we know that the tasks work on their
So, we know that the tasks work on their
own.
So, we know that these work on their
So, we know that these work on their
own, not randomized.
own, not randomized.
Can the drones stably hover?
Can the drones stably hover?
with randomization.
with randomization.
The idea here is this is a very easy
The idea here is this is a very easy
task if your dynamics are good.
task if your dynamics are good.
So if our uh if this doesn't work, it
So if our uh if this doesn't work, it
basically means the dynamics are wrong
basically means the dynamics are wrong
and there's like literally no way to
and there's like literally no way to
learn. I have to just fix the physics.
I guess technically it could be our
I guess technically it could be our
learning, but our learning is usually
learning, but our learning is usually
very very good.
Got a
Got a
that try this.
The goal with all of this, right, is
The goal with all of this, right, is
we're going to get this to the point
we're going to get this to the point
that we basically have a tiny model that
that we basically have a tiny model that
can just do whatever with drones.
can just do whatever with drones.
It's not like one model that has to be
It's not like one model that has to be
trained for each task or what now. It's

just going to do everything.
just going to do everything.
It'll be super robust. It'll go on real
It'll be super robust. It'll go on real

Be the goal.
I will talk a little bit about one of
I will talk a little bit about one of
the uh the next projects that I want to

do.
do.
Obviously, we're going to do stuff with

the drones. These aren't done, right?
the drones. These aren't done, right?
It's just that it becomes like type of
It's just that it becomes like type of
thing where we start looking for
thing where we start looking for
companies before we take it farther. Um,
companies before we take it farther. Um,
but the next thing I kind of want to
but the next thing I kind of want to
work on is a sixth degree of freedom
work on is a sixth degree of freedom

These things, they're like industrial

I think a lot of the Sims at the moment
I think a lot of the Sims at the moment
are really over complicated and really
are really over complicated and really
slow.

I think we could make our own version
I think we could make our own version
that's like very very simple, very

I think that the main question in my

There are a few different competing
There are a few different competing
theories on how we scale RL to work on

more compute. at the moment and I would
more compute. at the moment and I would
really like to have somebody to help

investigate these fully. There's off

Do it on a ton of environments like see

essentially, okay, if I were to give you

uh of what I want is I basically I want

a knob that I can turn use more compute
a knob that I can turn use more compute
and fewer samples or I can use more

can't really go the other way yet. So
can't really go the other way yet. So
the stuff I was just describing is on
the stuff I was just describing is on
that line, right? Do we do off policy?
that line, right? Do we do off policy?
Do we do search? Do we scale like model

Yeah, that's the main thing in my mind.
I think obviously there's still
I think obviously there's still
advancements we can make on like don't
advancements we can make on like don't
use any more compute and just make it
use any more compute and just make it
better, fewer samples, better learning

terms of just like capabilities we don't

one way or the other like that.
All right, this actually looks like it
All right, this actually looks like it
worked potentially.
the response in the stream. Got it.
Good.
This should be drones of different sizes
This should be drones of different sizes
and form factors and such hovering.
No problems.
We'll see if that's what we get.
Sam and I had a chat with a guy from
Sam and I had a chat with a guy from
drone racing team in Poland. Awesome.

I'm almost I'm almost done with your

it's taken longer than I wanted to. I
it's taken longer than I wanted to. I
hit a few bugs,
hit a few bugs,
but I almost have like the all-in-one

using Puffer. Awesome.
using Puffer. Awesome.
I'd be more than happy to chat with them
I'd be more than happy to chat with them
and also with you guys. How's the uh the
and also with you guys. How's the uh the
physical hardware going?

Cuz that's the main question I get. I've
Cuz that's the main question I get. I've
chatted with a couple different drone
chatted with a couple different drone
companies at this point as well. And
companies at this point as well. And
they kind of just like, yeah, the RL is
they kind of just like, yeah, the RL is
cool and stuff. They don't really
cool and stuff. They don't really
understand a lot of the RL oftentimes.
understand a lot of the RL oftentimes.
Uh the thing that would be most
Uh the thing that would be most
convincing is like seeing it do anything
convincing is like seeing it do anything
like something anything on real
like something anything on real
hardware. Even if we don't do any
hardware. Even if we don't do any
perception and we just have them fly

around and like you can see on the
around and like you can see on the
computer that it thinks it's flying

through loops and then on the real world
through loops and then on the real world
it's like doing cool aerials. That would
it's like doing cool aerials. That would
al already be awesome.
al already be awesome.
I think that will be enough to get us
I think that will be enough to get us
like some cool partnerships with
like some cool partnerships with
companies. Okay, so this is randomized
companies. Okay, so this is randomized
drones hovering. You can see their
drones hovering. You can see their
different sizes and form factors and
different sizes and form factors and
such. And with a few small exceptions,
such. And with a few small exceptions,
they're all hovering correctly.
they're all hovering correctly.
I think that this is like a reasonable
I think that this is like a reasonable
randomization band we've gotten out of
randomization band we've gotten out of
this. At least it's a good enough
this. At least it's a good enough
starting point.
This is the easiest task, though. So,
This is the easiest task, though. So,
let's see if I can get them to do the
let's see if I can get them to do the
flag.
Getting there. Let me know if there's
Getting there. Let me know if there's
anything I can do to help you guys.
anything I can do to help you guys.
Uh we're going to start doing a little
Uh we're going to start doing a little
bit more hardware with Puffer. I really
bit more hardware with Puffer. I really
don't want to do high fidelity control
don't want to do high fidelity control
stuff with Puffer. So like the max thing
stuff with Puffer. So like the max thing
I would look at is uh maybe like a six
I would look at is uh maybe like a six
degree of freedom arm, but I want to
degree of freedom arm, but I want to
actually start doing at least some
actually start doing at least some
hardware component with our stuff.
Mind you, I don't think that it's the
Mind you, I don't think that it's the
only thing we should do. Like there's
only thing we should do. Like there's
really valuable RL stuff that doesn't
really valuable RL stuff that doesn't
involve hardware at all.
involve hardware at all.
It's a massive blind spot for us to not
It's a massive blind spot for us to not
at least have some of it.
Well, we'll see. Oh, actually, this is a
Well, we'll see. Oh, actually, this is a
great question for you. Hey Finn, you
great question for you. Hey Finn, you
know the way that you did like the
know the way that you did like the
single file all the physics from scratch

I've been thinking about trying to do
I've been thinking about trying to do
that for a six degree of freedom arm.
that for a six degree of freedom arm.
How hard do you think that would be?
tried game playing agents. Yeah. So, I
tried game playing agents. Yeah. So, I
saw that. I love Carmarmac and every
saw that. I love Carmarmac and every
like all of his stuff, but from the RL
like all of his stuff, but from the RL
side, like that's the exact opposite
side, like that's the exact opposite
direction of what we want to go.

Like very low sample regime um from the
Like very low sample regime um from the
start at least. That's the last thing I
start at least. That's the last thing I
want to do.
want to do.
I think it's backwards. you solve high
I think it's backwards. you solve high
sample regime first, which is what we're
sample regime first, which is what we're
doing. And then the thing that I was
doing. And then the thing that I was
mentioning earlier of like having the
mentioning earlier of like having the
knob you can turn to crank down, like
knob you can turn to crank down, like
it's very important to do high sample
it's very important to do high sample
regime first.
regime first.
Not sure. God knows.
Not sure. God knows.
I think it cut your message off.
Happy to give it a go. Well, I want you
Happy to give it a go. Well, I want you
guys to do the drone stuff first.
guys to do the drone stuff first.
I definitely want you guys to do the
I definitely want you guys to do the
drone stuff first.
drone stuff first.
I also want to maybe look at a little
I also want to maybe look at a little
bit of the math myself because like come
bit of the math myself because like come
on, I my math can only be so bad, right?
on, I my math can only be so bad, right?
Like I've actually got to learn a little
Like I've actually got to learn a little
bit of this stuff at some point. Like
bit of this stuff at some point. Like
it's one differential equation.
it's one differential equation.
Shouldn't be that bad, right?
Like I did this stuff in undergrad. I
Like I did this stuff in undergrad. I
haven't used it in years, but it wasn't
haven't used it in years, but it wasn't
hard back then. It shouldn't be hard
hard back then. It shouldn't be hard
now.
I actually I was going to throw this
I actually I was going to throw this
book away and then I thought, "Oh, I
book away and then I thought, "Oh, I
might need that. Hang on.
Look at this. I happen to have in I just

Yeah, that's going to be awesome.
Okay.
Okay.
nine.

Let's see if this does flag for us.

This one's hard. I don't think we've
This one's hard. I don't think we've
gotten this to work before. I'll be
gotten this to work before. I'll be
happy if this works.
Randomized
Of
course, we're not going to know the sim
course, we're not going to know the sim
to real gap right the get-go.
My idea basically for these things
My idea basically for these things
though is
though is
I think we're going to want we're
I think we're going to want we're
essentially going to want the LSTM
essentially going to want the LSTM

these different randomized things and uh
these different randomized things and uh
it has to be able to basically do online

Okay, cool.
You have like the C policy from before.
You have like the C policy from before.
We can get like new policies into C for

you as well. I don't think structurally
you as well. I don't think structurally
it's gotten any more complicated since
it's gotten any more complicated since
then. Just the sim that's gotten
then. Just the sim that's gotten
complicated, which doesn't matter for
complicated, which doesn't matter for
this, right?
Okay.
Ah, yeah. So, this is what I remember,
Ah, yeah. So, this is what I remember,
right? Like it can't
right? Like it can't
it just can't quite do it, right?
What's our collision detection logic
What's our collision detection logic
look like?
This shouldn't matter because like it's
This shouldn't matter because like it's
not based on the size of the drone,
not based on the size of the drone,
right?
Nearest drone.

Yeah, it's a fixed 1.0.
That kind of weird.
Why can they hover but they can't make

the flag?
At least like they can kind of make the

Hovering works. It's like it's kind of a
Hovering works. It's like it's kind of a
flag, but what are you what are you
flag, but what are you what are you
doing over here? Right? Like what's this
doing over here? Right? Like what's this
guy doing?
It's possible some of the controls
It's possible some of the controls
really janky.
Rain longer or something.
You know what we're going to do?
You know what we're going to do?
I had an idea.

I wonder if the policy is any good.

cuz we're probably just going to have to

it's

it has to learn system ID implicitly.

It's like this. It's like if I give you

a new drone that you've never touched
a new drone that you've never touched
before, you have to learn to fly it

That's hard.
It's kind of crazy that this works at

The thing is that it's kind of flown

We just have to like subject this thing

Otherwise, this would be completely

It is getting 0.9

is not great. It's kind of like I think
for most of the tasks 0.9 looks like
for most of the tasks 0.9 looks like
vaguely floating around in generally the
vaguely floating around in generally the
right area for most of the drones and

0.95 is like oh yeah I see the formation
0.95 is like oh yeah I see the formation

it looks very clean.
It's a tough problem.

So if I have to train this thing for a

We do kind of care for like the

just scale it up works for your uh works

Maybe the formation tasks are just

harder somehow. I don't know.
Okay,
this is decent enough.
Next things on this project.
I mean, this is at least good enough

Huh?
I noticed entropy is almost all of your

based on PO, but it's meaningfully more
based on PO, but it's meaningfully more
advanced, like a generational
advanced, like a generational
improvement. And entropy really is not a
improvement. And entropy really is not a
big part of the algorithm. Like, it
big part of the algorithm. Like, it
matters a lot in some environments, but

I wouldn't even put it in like the top
I wouldn't even put it in like the top
five most important things about PO
or about our algorithm, at least about

our algorithm. Maybe in the top five

about PO, but not about our algorithm.
All of our new algorithm research and
All of our new algorithm research and
stuff is public as well. Like not only

is the code public, but I have writeups

on everything if you want to learn about

Oh,
Oh,
hang on. Did I do this wrong?
See if that makes a difference.
I would like to figure out how to

That's super annoying.
Oh, wait. Here. I found it. Hang on. Let

me fix that, guys.
All
right, that does it. Hard to read them
right, that does it. Hard to read them
recently. I'll use puff lip for my

Okay, this is totally different. So I
Okay, this is totally different. So I
think what happened this is very silly

is I just I literally just had run the

I'll have to let this finish and we'll

I have a whole bunch of cool projects

We'll see how long it takes me to get to

we'll see if there's any like business
we'll see if there's any like business

And then once I'm back, I'll be able to
And then once I'm back, I'll be able to
probably start cranking on some things.
probably start cranking on some things.
Oh yeah, this PF looks way better.
That's probably doing the flag, right?
We'll always like visualize to be sure,
We'll always like visualize to be sure,
but I think the process here is going to
but I think the process here is going to
be like make sure that the tasks work,
be like make sure that the tasks work,
make sure the tasks work randomized,
make sure the tasks work randomized,
then try to do them jointly.
Why does it auto complete that? That's
Why does it auto complete that? That's
so weird.
Oh.
But this is

Yep. American flag.

Not fully perfect. I can fix that up

All right, next thing.
So, we know that the tasks work on their

The idea here is this is a very easy

So if our uh if this doesn't work, it
So if our uh if this doesn't work, it
basically means the dynamics are wrong
basically means the dynamics are wrong
and there's like literally no way to

I guess technically it could be our

The goal with all of this, right, is

Uh the thing that would be most

I think that will be enough to get us

let's see if I can get them to do the

Maybe the formation tasks are just

harder somehow. I don't know.
Okay,
this is decent enough.
Next things on this project.
I mean, this is at least good enough
