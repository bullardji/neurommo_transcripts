okay we are back live
here bunch of stuff to
do
do
so this is
so this is
cool this is the Pito front of pong
oops this is the parito front of
Fong
Fong
welcome we
welcome we
are training baselines for all the M's
are training baselines for all the M's
for release
these look quite
these look quite
good so what we're going to do now is
good so what we're going to do now is
we're going to take all the
we're going to take all the
ones let's take
score greater than or equal to
score greater than or equal to
18 that gives us 32
18 that gives us 32
runs this gives you a nice sample see
runs this gives you a nice sample see
there actually still quite a bit of
there actually still quite a bit of
variety here
huh well that's interesting right look
huh well that's interesting right look
at the shape of
at the shape of
these okay so a lot of these are just
these okay so a lot of these are just
not trained for long enough it's like
not trained for long enough it's like
trying to figure out what the minimum
trying to figure out what the minimum
train time it can get away with
train time it can get away with
is you can see that
it's weird how variable it is isn't
it how long will it take for people to
it how long will it take for people to
start citing puff Li for soda in
start citing puff Li for soda in
pong I don't even care to be
honest out of the academic clout game
juice ain't worth to
squeeze I'm trying to see which of these
squeeze I'm trying to see which of these
we even want though these graphs are
we even want though these graphs are
kind of all over the place why are they
kind of all over the place why are they
this
this
variable why are they this
variable 131k batch size should be
variable 131k batch size should be
decent right
yeah we have the log
yeah we have the log
system that's odd I guess the games are
system that's odd I guess the games are
just really
long I'm like not sure which one of
long I'm like not sure which one of
these I actually want to get then
let me
see
so they all look mostly stable as
well do separate and
final that doesn't tell you anything
final that doesn't tell you anything
well that doesn't tell you
sensitivity oh hold on wait episode
sensitivity oh hold on wait episode
return
return
here why is this so much
smoother this shouldn't be like was Smo
smoother this shouldn't be like was Smo
there
right why is it 30 it shouldn't be able
right why is it 30 it shouldn't be able
to be
to be
30 sensitive like look at these are kind
30 sensitive like look at these are kind
of all over the place like it's not
of all over the place like it's not
going to be the same if you run it again
going to be the same if you run it again
for most of these
oh this is an
oh this is an
error but it's just a logging error
error but it's just a logging error
there's no reward give in here
yeah so that's that's purely a logging
yeah so that's that's purely a logging
error inflating the uh the returns it's
error inflating the uh the returns it's
not actually getting into the reward
not actually getting into the reward
signal
though it' be like this
entropy spam quite a lot
here well I think first of all we don't
here well I think first of all we don't
want 18 plus we
want we want at least 19 19 plus that
want we want at least 19 19 plus that
takes us down to 21
runs lambda's in a reasonable range
runs lambda's in a reasonable range
gamma is way higher than you'd expect
gamma is way higher than you'd expect
but actually no our version of pong does
but actually no our version of pong does
require High
require High
gamma quite a bit of learning rate
variability total time steps
variability total time steps
from this one looks decent 16k but this
from this one looks decent 16k but this
does four upd EPO why it's so
does four upd EPO why it's so
slow versus this
slow versus this
one com three update
Epoch this is your clear winner right
Epoch this is your clear winner right
here but I don't know how this curve
here but I don't know how this curve
looks
I mean that's actually decent
I mean that's actually decent
right let's take this one and see if it
right let's take this one and see if it
Repros
very high gamas I think this is no frame
very high gamas I think this is no frame
skip as well is what this is we don't
skip as well is what this is we don't
train with frame skip at all
um max grad
um max grad
Norm did I get everything
Norm did I get everything
I think that's
everything 30 million steps why not
right well
right well
actually num M's worker so we can
actually num M's worker so we can
actually make it faster with v native
you only take like a
minute there you
go less than a minute
why is the episode length
why is the episode length
so that's crazy long for epis isn't
so that's crazy long for epis isn't
it maybe not
8,000 no cuz 6,000
8,000 no cuz 6,000
is uh 600 seconds
no 100 seconds yeah that's
reasonable let's see what
reasonable let's see what
uh what puffer lib
uh what puffer lib
says so puffer lib says
mostly
solved kind of
solved kind of
odd decent enough though
a wrong machine
I will now shift this
yeah and that is the same
here's pong
here's pong
agent why is it
losing this doesn't seem right to me
something's got to be different with
something's got to be different with
settings right
maybe it just had a bad start let's
see yeah know it's dropping lots of
see yeah know it's dropping lots of
points
that doesn't match the uh yeah this does
that doesn't match the uh yeah this does
not match
not match
the performance from the graph
yeah it's dropped Four
yeah it's dropped Four
Points it should drop two at
most look at the settings
FR skip is set to one here
set to one
set to one
there so something's different
yeah yeah it got 20 but it dropped some
points score function goes from - 20 to
points score function goes from - 20 to
20 to get 20 you have to not drop any
20 to get 20 you have to not drop any
points to the
points to the
opponent to your score minus opponent
score we have very high standards around
score we have very high standards around
here for agents shouldn't Max score be
here for agents shouldn't Max score be
25 why would it
be I think it's technically 21 there's
be I think it's technically 21 there's
like a last point or whatever
I mean this looks like a straight up
I mean this looks like a straight up
discrepancy well now it's doing
better just did it just have a really
better just did it just have a really
bad game Let's watch
okay you know what that's better that's
okay you know what that's better that's
a perfect win
a perfect win
right so I don't know I just had a bad
right so I don't know I just had a bad
game
game
I think we're loading the right
I think we're loading the right
model should be
fine pong is now good
yeah now these match perfectly as
yeah now these match perfectly as
well surprise it's not
well surprise it's not
perfect
perfect
um you know I am as well cuz it was
um you know I am as well cuz it was
looking perfect
looking perfect
before I'm trying to
think I change anything
I honestly think it's probably kind of
I honestly think it's probably kind of
variable like the fact that it got 20
here and then it
like did get some K spikes
it's just a matter of how much I want to
it's just a matter of how much I want to
mess with it
right like okay there's also this one
we could try this
this is actually considered a long
this is actually considered a long
Horizon task as well RS does not have
Horizon task as well RS does not have
frame
frame
skip so you can see how high the gamas
skip so you can see how high the gamas
are
I miss Max
I miss Max
bradm I got it
we'll watch this for a
second a
minute yeah do that so that I can be
minute yeah do that so that I can be
confused for an hour when it [ __ ]
confused for an hour when it [ __ ]
makes some [ __ ] up no thank you
I'll write the damn script myself when I
I'll write the damn script myself when I
want
to there's definitely some instability
to there's definitely some instability
involved
here it's like oscillating around 20
19.4 was no point in training this thing
19.4 was no point in training this thing
Beyond 20 mil right
see how this goes by
see how this goes by
comparison this will also give us a
comparison this will also give us a
little sense of
little sense of
variance oops
and see it only got to 18.8 here I think
and see it only got to 18.8 here I think
there's
variance I know it
actually dip down
more maybe this is just one that is like
more maybe this is just one that is like
unstable and has to only be trained for
I don't like it being unstable like that
though it makes sense why you would get
though it makes sense why you would get
unstable results from carbs though if
unstable results from carbs though if
you think about it
what happens if we do
what happens if we do
15 I'm actually I'm
curious I'm curious if it evals higher
so the thing I think is happening is uh
so the thing I think is happening is uh
because I'm directly sweeping to try to
because I'm directly sweeping to try to
find the best policy the
find the best policy the
fastest uh the best way to do that is to
fastest uh the best way to do that is to
find unstable
find unstable
settings so we have to account for
that eval
that eval
Min that's not the issue the eval is
Min that's not the issue the eval is
accurate the eval is uh 10% of the steps
accurate the eval is uh 10% of the steps
done again at the end um that's not the
issue okay interesting so you can see
issue okay interesting so you can see
here this did not work at
all the easiest is to keep it at 30 mil
all the easiest is to keep it at 30 mil
we'll see if it's
consistent didn't I have good settings
consistent didn't I have good settings
before what was I using
here wasn't this just better
uh so you can see what happened
uh so you can see what happened
right it found less stable
settings yeah that's exactly what
happened
happened
yeah e
here whenever you want yeah let me train
here whenever you want yeah let me train
this I'm going to go back to this
this I'm going to go back to this
one I think because even though it's
one I think because even though it's
slower
I'm trying to think what I want to do
I'm trying to think what I want to do
honestly what did this just give
me this just
me this just
gave slightly under
20 I kind of want to keep the stable set
20 I kind of want to keep the stable set
but I think we're going to go back to
but I think we're going to go back to
these
and then we'll look at your
end it's just being too aggressive as
end it's just being too aggressive as
all
you can see 0.01 learning rate it just
you can see 0.01 learning rate it just
has like crazy freaking learning
rate okay and then EPO three
that ought to be
good it's just 20 mil
maybe this will still be good we'll see
people are really mad at peer
review this post has 150k and
review this post has 150k and
841 6.2 and 202 people real mad at PE
841 6.2 and 202 people real mad at PE
review as they should be it's a mess
that looks good to
me yeah that's 20.4 yeah this is good we
me yeah that's 20.4 yeah this is good we
got
it for
get so
slow okay
slow okay
there we
there we
[Music]
go okay there's pong
go okay there's pong
forams I'm going to grab the uh the
forams I'm going to grab the uh the
policy and then I'm going to look at
policy and then I'm going to look at
your M
your M
Xander if that's good by you
long
long
agent that plays very nicely
very
good Gander oops
okay what do we looking at
where is uh your an Xander
scroll
up yeah I can't I need code though man
up yeah I can't I need code though man
to be able to tell
to be able to tell
anything like link code
I saw the print out and it looks weird
I saw the print out and it looks weird
but I need
but I need
code still in my Fork I I don't remember
code still in my Fork I I don't remember
where your fork was though unless maybe
where your fork was though unless maybe
it's do I have it
here yeah okay I found it
pick up
I'm space is
fine uh here's your problem I think let
fine uh here's your problem I think let
me
see oh you have
see oh you have
this
really I'm not going to merge this yet
really I'm not going to merge this yet
but I'll do this
we're going to figure out what's wrong
we're going to figure out what's wrong
with your
with your
end and for folks interested in
end and for folks interested in
contributing um I go through all
contributing um I go through all
contributor code like this if you get
contributor code like this if you get
stuck on stuff it's pretty easy to get
stuck on stuff it's pretty easy to get
help
which is nice because I charge companies
which is nice because I charge companies
to do the similar stuff for their
to do the similar stuff for their
proprietary
proprietary
whatever uh open source gets it for
free for
that's
bizarre you should be able to do Native
back oh is there a different
branch are you on a branch here
wait where's your
code oh
I gotta
this will take a second to build and
this will take a second to build and
then I'm going to go through the process
then I'm going to go through the process
of uh figuring out why this is slow
of uh figuring out why this is slow
hopefully there will be something cool
hopefully there will be something cool
and learnable from this but it's also
and learnable from this but it's also
possible that there's just more stuff
possible that there's just more stuff
you need to do
um is this supposed to
work I don't see the I don't think you
work I don't see the I don't think you
added it here so I don't know how this
added it here so I don't know how this
is supposed to be
working
right e
that takes forever to initialize
okay so it's like all in forward
policy looks
fine bad size
fine bad size
three so whatever you did B you have bat
three so whatever you did B you have bat
size three
size three
here that's why it's
here that's why it's
slow now I see that you actually tried
slow now I see that you actually tried
to fix
to fix
that uh so you got partway there but you
that uh so you got partway there but you
didn't
didn't
check so you did this but then you
check so you did this but then you
didn't actually check that these were
didn't actually check that these were
getting applied
getting applied
correctly it looks to
me e
okay so you actually have no Ms it's
okay so you actually have no Ms it's
getting passed correctly so this is a u
getting passed correctly so this is a u
issue not a me issue
then it's not like so perer is passing
then it's not like so perer is passing
jar
correctly are you just not doing it
your
your
M you pass it to cython right
there looks good here as
well so why
3x
56 three
56 three
agents so what's wrong
right
here right here
here right here
man you said it correctly and then you
man you said it correctly and then you
overwrote it
[Music]
actually
seg ball
yeah e
bin is z is
one we do a little debugging you
one we do a little debugging you
know we do a little debugging in our
day BS
day BS
two bins
here you have it set
here you have it set
okay yeah that's
right have you done this
yeah you changed it to one in config
yeah you changed it to one in config
it's
it's
fine okay so this thing
runs at what I would consider good rate
allocate
it for
okay next option so I can't figure out
okay next option so I can't figure out
what's
what's
wrong we're going to run GDB on python
wrong we're going to run GDB on python
which is fun
it's not going to tell us anything is
it got to love when it does that
uh does this definition match
your definition
matches
for
e e
who did not permit it
still seg faults
[Music]
[Music]
h
mm
PA for
you didn't mess up the AR
order for
initialization looks good
those are the really common ones
wonder if we can compile this
wonder if we can compile this
with I don't usually have to do this
not all members yeah that's fine
uh that actually did
uh that actually did
help yeah that actually did help
oh
oh
wait that actually gives it to us for
wait that actually gives it to us for
once
so this is out of bound
somehow you don't need to inline all
somehow you don't need to inline all
your methods by the
your methods by the
way it's generally not a good idea to do
way it's generally not a good idea to do
that you inline like little tiny helper
that you inline like little tiny helper
methods like if you're going to make
methods like if you're going to make
like a distance check function that's
like a distance check function that's
like one line you inline that don't
like one line you inline that don't
inline everything like this it like it
inline everything like this it like it
just makes the C code gigantic and
just makes the C code gigantic and
actually can slow stuff
down this is
down this is
interesting but this is where it screws
up how about static
up how about static
nah you need
that I'm going to be honest I honestly
that I'm going to be honest I honestly
forget what half the keywords even do
forget what half the keywords even do
because I don't use them because you
because I don't use them because you
don't need them
C is a very simple language if you let
C is a very simple language if you let
it
be it's interesting that this is broken
be it's interesting that this is broken
somehow for
181 really
no I have the suspicion
it's
fun
for e
get this
right working on your
right working on your
end yeah it works on my end too but then
end yeah it works on my end too but then
it seg faults
found
it probably
this e
really
e e
looks like you have like multiple weird
looks like you have like multiple weird
things going on here that's an infinite
things going on here that's an infinite
Loop
well I don't know how that's possible
well I don't know how that's possible
given I found like I found multiple
given I found like I found multiple
things
wrong so okay I'll I'll give you a
wrong so okay I'll I'll give you a
couple things to go off of from
couple things to go off of from
this um first of all you'll get a
this um first of all you'll get a
million if you just increase the number
million if you just increase the number
of M's like a thousand or
of M's like a thousand or
whatever um second of
whatever um second of
all
all
here so things I found
right I added your bindings
uh don't commit the compiled. C
uh don't commit the compiled. C
files uh hold
on so thing number
on so thing number
one is you overwrote n
thing number
thing number
two uh scyon is not the place to get
two uh scyon is not the place to get
cute with your struct
cute with your struct
definitions you want to copy your struct
definitions you want to copy your struct
definitions exactly from C you don't
definitions exactly from C you don't
want to reorder them you don't want to
want to reorder them you don't want to
emit any because you need to know what
emit any because you need to know what
you did was you told uh
you did was you told uh
scyon that the size of your struct was
scyon that the size of your struct was
different from the size the struct
different from the size the struct
actually is so when you go to Malik it
actually is so when you go to Malik it
you are malaking the wrong amount of
you are malaking the wrong amount of
bites so you want to just copy paste
bites so you want to just copy paste
brain
brain
dead paste your struct
dead paste your struct
definitions scyon and then was there
definitions scyon and then was there
anything
else nope that's it so those were the
else nope that's it so those were the
two things that I uh I found initially
two things that I uh I found initially
for
for
you fix that you'll fix your seg fols
you fix that you'll fix your seg fols
you can probably do some testing and see
you can probably do some testing and see
to fix those and you should be good
if you have time to finish those tonight
if you have time to finish those tonight
I will be able to finish reviews
I will be able to finish reviews
tomorrow and merge if it is
stable yep no
stable yep no
worries I get build errors
worries I get build errors
oh
down
e e
some of these
uh do we not have breakout
uh do we not have breakout
PR or did I merge breakout
PR oh I did merge breakout
PR great
on end
okay that'll
run and now we have
run and now we have
pong see what we
have okay so we have
have okay so we have
pong breakouts training Connect Four is
pong breakouts training Connect Four is
done snake I just have to mark and
done snake I just have to mark and
there's a little work to do on this m
there's a little work to do on this m
but I have the
but I have the
Baseline moile I just have to
Baseline moile I just have to
train and that leaves these okay we're
train and that leaves these okay we're
making good progress on Ms we're making
making good progress on Ms we're making
good progress on
MS e
okay look at that two minutes
uh this curve is not
reproducing hold on this curve is not
reproducing hold on this curve is not
acting as expected
right me check the link run
where's Spencer's
run okay so here's what it's supposed to
run okay so here's what it's supposed to
look like according dis
look like according dis
Spenser e
oh these are steps not seconds damn it
so it should
so it should
be three minutes
be three minutes
for
solve yeah there we
solve yeah there we
go this is fine I was just reading the
go this is fine I was just reading the
axis
wrong so that'll finish
wrong so that'll finish
we break out and then we'll have some
we break out and then we'll have some
other Bas lines to do with snake and
other Bas lines to do with snake and
whatnot
minutes um let me think in the meantime
so this one I just need to screw with
so this one I just need to screw with
the renderer and like default settings
the renderer and like default settings
for this and we can ship that uh MOA
for this and we can ship that uh MOA
just needs a train run it's like a on
just needs a train run it's like a on
hour train run to Mark as a
hour train run to Mark as a
basine it's like decent
basine it's like decent
enough tactics Nathan's doing
enough tactics Nathan's doing
tactics go and rware I got to talk with
tactics go and rware I got to talk with
Spence for about and then all the other
Spence for about and then all the other
ones are done so we'll have
ones are done so we'll have
five we should have five finished
five we should have five finished
baselines
baselines
today depending on if I run the Moa
experiment I might actually already have
experiment I might actually already have
that one
see all Weare should be
see all Weare should be
easy go we'll see
easy go we'll see
about TCG needs some more tactics and
about TCG needs some more tactics and
others yeah
okay this is very good though
it's kind of fiddly
the uh the score here it's kind of
fiddly actually just check one email on
fiddly actually just check one email on
the side here while we
the side here while we
uh this finish
five end done today is
good wait
oh wait
oh wait
three Enduro trash pickup yeah we'll
three Enduro trash pickup yeah we'll
have 10 we'll have at least 10
have 10 we'll have at least 10
M's uh for
M's uh for
release plus TCG and Robo code and
Dev those will be
Dev those will be
fun those will probably be what I do
fun those will probably be what I do
when either somebody can do them you
when either somebody can do them you
know people are interested in deving Ms
know people are interested in deving Ms
can do the uh additional M projects
can do the uh additional M projects
or uh I will do them whenever I get
or uh I will do them whenever I get
boarded for a couple days here and
there yeah it's definitely full
there yeah it's definitely full
solving
often for
so much
[ __ ] by the way um this cleans up
[ __ ] by the way um this cleans up
your X feed very very
your X feed very very
quickly if you just anything that's like
quickly if you just anything that's like
total
slop very very quickly
2 minutes and then then we will uh we'll
2 minutes and then then we will uh we'll
grab that policy we'll commit forams we
grab that policy we'll commit forams we
will
grab probably snake snake's like a
grab probably snake snake's like a
two-minute train run I
two-minute train run I
believe is that fully committed up yeah
believe is that fully committed up yeah
it
is
yep 850 and does it match
yep 850 and does it match
so this is my breakout it's very
so this is my breakout it's very
clean and
clean and
then spener
breakout this is Spencer one I think
breakout this is Spencer one I think
right so we guess up
to can't tell actually
oh there you go
dispensers then r
model right
model right
here yeah I think it
here yeah I think it
matches I think we have everything
right
right
yeah it's like consistently either full
yeah it's like consistently either full
solving or almost
solving or almost
full
solving so I would like this to have
solving so I would like this to have
been faster but breakout actually does
been faster but breakout actually does
usually take a stupid number of samples
usually take a stupid number of samples
to
train yeah that's actually that's a very
train yeah that's actually that's a very
clean graph look at that towards the end
clean graph look at that towards the end
here this is
here this is
perfect exactly what we want in a
baseline it does now um like 25 no 30
baseline it does now um like 25 no 30
million steps worth of evals I
million steps worth of evals I
believe and we should see the result of
that in a
moment that takes less time than
moment that takes less time than
anything
anything
else oh
so
so
see where's the eval at the end
oh it's in uh return yeah so
oh it's in uh return yeah so
857 the final on score here on episode
857 the final on score here on episode
return or
return or
whatever very
good we do so we take
this this model
break
out did you see my question on go no I
out did you see my question on go no I
did not hold on I did train your uh
did not hold on I did train your uh
breakout model I reproduce
that where is your go
question yeah Ander Happ
question yeah Ander Happ
customer uh where's your go
question I got the world I got the world
question I got the world I got the world
record on go a win rate on
record on go a win rate on
go I think it got eaten
go I think it got eaten
by
what do you want the Baseline well how
what do you want the Baseline well how
do they train do you have curves to link
do they train do you have curves to link
for
for
them by chat oh okay yeah
them by chat oh okay yeah
so uh did how like how well do they
so uh did how like how well do they
train right the different board sizes
train right the different board sizes
and like are they actually
and like are they actually
reasonable like have you played
it because it may as well be 9 by9 if um
it because it may as well be 9 by9 if um
if the opponent sucks right if the
if the opponent sucks right if the
opponent is good then it makes sense to
opponent is good then it makes sense to
go to bigger
boards e
without changing anything
fails interesting it beats 8 by8 and not
fails interesting it beats 8 by8 and not
by9 here's your breakout model
did it just do that
did it just do that
intentionally that was really
intentionally that was really
good it missed
good it missed
there no oh no it's actually it's doing
there no oh no it's actually it's doing
it isn't it it's trying to get it in
it isn't it it's trying to get it in
that I think it's trying to get it to
that I think it's trying to get it to
like Bounce from the top
cuz it's pushing it to the left yeah
cuz it's pushing it to the left yeah
yeah yeah I totally did that right look
yeah yeah I totally did that right look
that's
cool dude this is a good policy nice job
man look at
this they're way better than I am at
this they're way better than I am at
this
moves pretty smooth as
moves pretty smooth as
well uh is it frame skipping or not I
forget yeah it is frame
forget yeah it is frame
skipping oh jeez so this is like a lot
skipping oh jeez so this is like a lot
of frames then no big deal it's
fast was it harder without uh without
fast was it harder without uh without
frame skip
like I would expect it to be I would
like I would expect it to be I would
expect it to take longer at first but
expect it to take longer at first but
then to be like easier to uh to get the
then to be like easier to uh to get the
last few
last few
points in the reev what
doesn't have huge
doesn't have huge
impact go back no worries we can do that
impact go back no worries we can do that
at some point this is solid though
it doesn't know what to do at the
end oh look at
end oh look at
that first screen cleared with no lives
that first screen cleared with no lives
lost is a good
lost is a good
policy a very good policy this is a good
policy a very good policy this is a good
job this is very well
job this is very well
done I'm pleased with this
it's important to actually watch your
it's important to actually watch your
policy a
policy a
bunch make sure stuff is as you'd
expect you can see it's like trying to
expect you can see it's like trying to
get it through uh is trying to get it
get it through uh is trying to get it
through so it like bounces on the
top holy that's good
so not going to do the bounce
thing clever
thing clever
puff it doesn't it's not doing it now
puff it doesn't it's not doing it now
though I guess it just figures all right
though I guess it just figures all right
whatever we'll do it this
way to be fair it's usually riskier to
way to be fair it's usually riskier to
set up the bounce Strat
oh it lost oh it lost because I held
oh it lost oh it lost because I held
shift by mistake because I was going to
shift by mistake because I was going to
take a
take a
screenshot my
bad thing's genius
bad thing's genius
yes God
yes God
gamer all right well done
make Baseline
next should I
next should I
sweep if it's not a fundamental bug then
sweep if it's not a fundamental bug then
yes if it makes no prog if it beats 8
yes if it makes no prog if it beats 8
by8 and makes no progress 9 by9 I
by8 and makes no progress 9 by9 I
wouldn't be surprised you have an even
wouldn't be surprised you have an even
odd thing going
on I'm train the final policy for snake
on I'm train the final policy for snake
here this is a way better snake policy
here this is a way better snake policy
as well
yeah try s by seven that's a good

and then I've got one other end
and then I've got one other end
obviously
obviously
and uh other than that I mean we can put
and uh other than that I mean we can put
the robo code demo on or whatever the
the robo code demo on or whatever the
robo code really shouldn't be that hard
robo code really shouldn't be that hard
to like get something out there if
to like get something out there if
anybody's remotely interested like
anybody's remotely interested like
that's a pretty short and easy project I
that's a pretty short and easy project I
don't know if anybody's currently
don't know if anybody's currently
working on
it triple Triad oh yeah yeah yeah
it triple Triad oh yeah yeah yeah
um H it has a baseline I don't know if
um H it has a baseline I don't know if
it's solved we're not dropping it we
it's solved we're not dropping it we
want that M yeah I forgot about triple
want that M yeah I forgot about triple
triy it why did I forget about it it
triy it why did I forget about it it
just not on the website or
just not on the website or
[Music]
[Music]
something oh I literally just forgot to
something oh I literally just forgot to
put it there my bad yeah no triple
put it there my bad yeah no triple
triad's great of course we're going to
triad's great of course we're going to
have that
have that
I literally just forgot to put
it why would we drop it it's a good end
Gotta Love snake training at 1.2 million
Gotta Love snake training at 1.2 million
we need more M to train over a
million proud of my snake
in
e
e e
I am actually serious about the
uh about optimizing the Thousand calorie
mug th calorie mug is an
mug th calorie mug is an
excellent thing to optimize
7 by seven gets
7 by seven gets
solved time step cut off it should be
solved time step cut off it should be
like a fixed multile you should just
like a fixed multile you should just
make it a fix multiple of the board size
make it a fix multiple of the board size
man just make it like two or three times
man just make it like two or three times
the uh number of squares whatever you
know e
isn't there a network for
this
for
e e
lineer e
yeah here's this mobet thing
right e
on 2D is going to be in agents
what's this five
what's this five
channels oh eight
we're just making the uh the new foret
we're just making the uh the new foret
and
and
C real
C real
quick not that
hard so what's this input
hard so what's this input
put
put
them eight channels
FAL size
when I set time scap time step cap
when I set time scap time step cap
starts to
starts to
learn so my increase
learn so my increase
total total steps yeah that's what you
total total steps yeah that's what you
would do so it's just because you don't
would do so it's just because you don't
have masking it takes a really long time
have masking it takes a really long time
to figure that out
to figure that out
out it should be getting penalized right
out it should be getting penalized right
for
illegals good
do you think the
do you think the
weight should be
weight should be
tuned probably
tuned probably
probably should
be I'm questioning my decisions here
what we're going to do is we're going to
what we're going to do is we're going to
hard code
this is a good compromise
this
good missing a r
here we're missing a
here we're missing a
r
e e
on
on
con
con
[Music]
linear where's my freaking lstm my
gu okay
so weights
I don't even know if this is the right
signature let's get
this okay so
this okay so
weights um agents
makes input
dim channels is eight I believe right
dim channels is eight I believe right
yeah
yeah
um CNN channels
um CNN channels
328 and then the output dim is
very
good and then
very
nice and I would like to
I would like to make
this that was 24 snake
D snakes
nice
boarded okay
this needs to be adjusted
right still
uh o that's a totally different thing
uh o that's a totally different thing
than I expected isn't it
yeah that's just using linear
lstm this is a linear lsdm
else
to okay
Waits it's 11 time 11 dummy
s
still
no give and go is a more complex M to
no give and go is a more complex M to
solve could benefit from more parallel
solve could benefit from more parallel
M's uh most likely
yes also it'll just make these steps per
yes also it'll just make these steps per
second faster which is always
nice to be fair uh initially you're just
nice to be fair uh initially you're just
getting screwed by uh lack of masking so
getting screwed by uh lack of masking so
I wouldn't worry too too much about that
it's literally just
it's literally just
linear linear lstm
linear linear lstm
right 128
right 128
dim oh wait what why is the recurrent
dim oh wait what why is the recurrent
size 512 is that a thing no it's it's
size 512 is that a thing no it's it's
um yeah so [ __ ] coded to
um yeah so [ __ ] coded to
128 for
agents times input
agents times input
them
them
ah yeah
but this should be fine
or was that what was overflowed
oh is this it somehow
I
I
zero
really e
input dim is zero
somehow
somehow
oh that's weird put this here
yep there we go
runs real slow
there you go when you build with fast on
there you go when you build with fast on
it's good
um the agents seem rather stupid
though I take it this is not the full
policy e
I put the latest snake weights in and
I put the latest snake weights in and
that there should be way better than
that there should be way better than
this
right e
yeah you can see very quickly it's way
yeah you can see very quickly it's way
better
right e
there we go I just didn't copi the file
over
over
lovely this is kind of small and hard to
lovely this is kind of small and hard to
see even though it's visually nice uh
see even though it's visually nice uh
nice and impressive so we'll see if we
nice and impressive so we'll see if we
use this or some version some alternate
use this or some version some alternate
version of it but this is very
nice they don't all just go straight up
nice they don't all just go straight up
it's nice and balanced yeah this is
it's nice and balanced yeah this is
good and this runs cleanly as
well very
good e
okay um so so far today we
okay um so so far today we
have pretty darn nice models
have pretty darn nice models
for snake mooba
for snake mooba
[Music]
[Music]
breakout Connect Four so these four are
breakout Connect Four so these four are
pretty well set MOA we just have to
pretty well set MOA we just have to
double check
actually still know if it was marked as
actually still know if it was marked as
Baseline
yeah I guess not so we have to make a
yeah I guess not so we have to make a
baseline at some point but that's uh
baseline at some point but that's uh
good you'll do
good you'll do
go rware uh triple Triad I just forgot
go rware uh triple Triad I just forgot
to list
here let me just double check one thing
here let me just double check one thing
on uh on dinner here
okay we have half hour to finish some
okay we have half hour to finish some
stuff
up e
I literally have triple Triad there as
I literally have triple Triad there as
well I just forgot to include it I guess
see where's a good
spot snake
[Music]
the
heck oh my vmrc is
heck oh my vmrc is
not that's okay
all
fryad e
width and
height how do you get a image size
this better idea
so
982 982
994 e
can I just
do hold on
really
ah 8,000 wrong
one there we go
triple
triple
[Music]
[Music]
Triad pm
there we know there we go very
nice well not found
so resolution we still have to fix on
so resolution we still have to fix on
some
[ __ ] oh actually
990 by a th000
cool it's better
okay cool add a triple Triad to the
okay cool add a triple Triad to the
website very nice
was that
was that
120 for
[Music]
[Music]
okay got our snake end we got triple
okay got our snake end we got triple
Triad
I'm trying to think from
here for the snake
ends e
and 1280 over
and 1280 over
two yeah 640 duh
more okay that's good no
more okay that's good no
snakes 49 food
idea here is 256 snakes will be easier
idea here is 256 snakes will be easier
to run on mobile and stuff but also like
to run on mobile and stuff but also like
you'll actually be able to see them I
you'll actually be able to see them I
don't know it might still look cool
don't know it might still look cool
we'll
see still trains nice and
fast e
let's take a look at the training curve
snake oops
okay so this is what we're competing
okay so this is what we're competing
against here
getting to be quite the same size but
getting to be quite the same size but
then
then
again
again
um not clear if it should be just
um not clear if it should be just
perfectly the same I think smaller map
perfectly the same I think smaller map
should be a little bit
should be a little bit
harder cuz you can't like you can't just
harder cuz you can't like you can't just
all go in One Direction now there it
all go in One Direction now there it
goes now to
solid kind of es and flows
I wonder if that's
unstable something weird is happening
see
see
ah yeah K's
not the policy seems less well
behaved that's annoying
does seem to sort of recover a little
bit maybe
not
e e
okay so this is a little better
okay so this is a little better
right you can kind of see what's going
right you can kind of see what's going
on a little more
I think that could be cool
I don't know what what do we think
I don't know what what do we think
here this will probably run better as
here this will probably run better as
well on
well on
web still IS 250 some L of snakes in
it yeah I like that we'll run a sweep or
it yeah I like that we'll run a sweep or
something to figure out because this
something to figure out because this
thing's not
stable no big deal
pretty
cool e
all right that's a nice little finding
all right that's a nice little finding
though this is
though this is
good I think this Escape doesn't work or
good I think this Escape doesn't work or
something there we
go uh and I'm going to have to head for
go uh and I'm going to have to head for
dinner in a second
here just monitor one thing
second
where my conf go
oh
I'm very confused where my configs keep
I'm very confused where my configs keep
going because I keep editing [ __ ] and it
going because I keep editing [ __ ] and it
keeps not being reflected correctly
well I'm going to go handle uh one
well I'm going to go handle uh one
config thing and then uh I'm going to
config thing and then uh I'm going to
get
get
dinner I see my green screen is messed
dinner I see my green screen is messed
up I got to have the lights on so that
up I got to have the lights on so that
works anyways I will be uh I will be
works anyways I will be uh I will be

that uh whoops tossed questions in
that uh whoops tossed questions in
Discord I think I missed some messages
Discord I think I missed some messages
for Spencer that I'll answer before I
for Spencer that I'll answer before I
head
head
out tost questions in
Discord why does it seemingly take
longer 2048
yeah we'll just do this for you real
yeah we'll just do this for you real
quick
Spencer it's just bigger batch size man
Spencer it's just bigger batch size man
the
the
um the thing is yes big bat size will
um the thing is yes big bat size will
help you learn go because go is a hard
help you learn go because go is a hard
game but the uh the illegal move thing
game but the uh the illegal move thing
is literally just like a One-Stop
is literally just like a One-Stop
prediction problem uh it's a really easy
prediction problem uh it's a really easy
thing it just takes a bunch of samples
thing it just takes a bunch of samples
to figure out all the different cells
to figure out all the different cells
that are inv valid so that's probably
that are inv valid so that's probably
why it should help you after you figure
why it should help you after you figure
that portion out uh but yeah it's going
that portion out uh but yeah it's going
to be a pain until then if you want you
to be a pain until then if you want you
can probably just sweep the reward like
can probably just sweep the reward like
the negative reward for illegal moves
the negative reward for illegal moves
look at OBS stuff like that and you
look at OBS stuff like that and you
should be good U I also don't even know
should be good U I also don't even know
if you have a reasonable Network for
if you have a reasonable Network for
this thing yet uh because they're
this thing yet uh because they're
technically they're three
technically they're three
states
so it might just work as
so it might just work as
is anyways that's all for today thanks
is anyways that's all for today thanks
folks uh I'll answer more stuff later
folks uh I'll answer more stuff later
Spencer if you have more questions bye

Kind: captions
Language: en
okay we are back live
here bunch of stuff to
do
do
so this is
so this is
cool this is the Pito front of pong
oops this is the parito front of
Fong
Fong
welcome we
welcome we
are training baselines for all the M's
are training baselines for all the M's
for release
these look quite
these look quite
good so what we're going to do now is
good so what we're going to do now is
we're going to take all the
we're going to take all the
ones let's take
score greater than or equal to
score greater than or equal to
18 that gives us 32
18 that gives us 32
runs this gives you a nice sample see
runs this gives you a nice sample see
there actually still quite a bit of
there actually still quite a bit of
variety here
huh well that's interesting right look
huh well that's interesting right look
at the shape of
at the shape of
these okay so a lot of these are just
these okay so a lot of these are just
not trained for long enough it's like
not trained for long enough it's like
trying to figure out what the minimum
trying to figure out what the minimum
train time it can get away with
train time it can get away with
is you can see that
it's weird how variable it is isn't
it how long will it take for people to
it how long will it take for people to
start citing puff Li for soda in
start citing puff Li for soda in
pong I don't even care to be
honest out of the academic clout game
juice ain't worth to
squeeze I'm trying to see which of these
squeeze I'm trying to see which of these
we even want though these graphs are
we even want though these graphs are
kind of all over the place why are they
kind of all over the place why are they
this
this
variable why are they this
variable 131k batch size should be
variable 131k batch size should be
decent right
yeah we have the log
yeah we have the log
system that's odd I guess the games are
system that's odd I guess the games are
just really
long I'm like not sure which one of
long I'm like not sure which one of
these I actually want to get then
let me
see
so they all look mostly stable as
well do separate and
final that doesn't tell you anything
final that doesn't tell you anything
well that doesn't tell you
sensitivity oh hold on wait episode
sensitivity oh hold on wait episode
return
return
here why is this so much
smoother this shouldn't be like was Smo
smoother this shouldn't be like was Smo
there
right why is it 30 it shouldn't be able
right why is it 30 it shouldn't be able
to be
to be
30 sensitive like look at these are kind
30 sensitive like look at these are kind
of all over the place like it's not
of all over the place like it's not
going to be the same if you run it again
going to be the same if you run it again
for most of these
oh this is an
oh this is an
error but it's just a logging error
error but it's just a logging error
there's no reward give in here
yeah so that's that's purely a logging
yeah so that's that's purely a logging
error inflating the uh the returns it's
error inflating the uh the returns it's
not actually getting into the reward
not actually getting into the reward
signal
though it' be like this
entropy spam quite a lot
here well I think first of all we don't
here well I think first of all we don't
want 18 plus we
want we want at least 19 19 plus that
want we want at least 19 19 plus that
takes us down to 21
runs lambda's in a reasonable range
runs lambda's in a reasonable range
gamma is way higher than you'd expect
gamma is way higher than you'd expect
but actually no our version of pong does
but actually no our version of pong does
require High
require High
gamma quite a bit of learning rate
variability total time steps
variability total time steps
from this one looks decent 16k but this
from this one looks decent 16k but this
does four upd EPO why it's so
does four upd EPO why it's so
slow versus this
slow versus this
one com three update
Epoch this is your clear winner right
Epoch this is your clear winner right
here but I don't know how this curve
here but I don't know how this curve
looks
I mean that's actually decent
I mean that's actually decent
right let's take this one and see if it
right let's take this one and see if it
Repros
very high gamas I think this is no frame
very high gamas I think this is no frame
skip as well is what this is we don't
skip as well is what this is we don't
train with frame skip at all
um max grad
um max grad
Norm did I get everything
Norm did I get everything
I think that's
everything 30 million steps why not
right well
right well
actually num M's worker so we can
actually num M's worker so we can
actually make it faster with v native
you only take like a
minute there you
go less than a minute
why is the episode length
why is the episode length
so that's crazy long for epis isn't
so that's crazy long for epis isn't
it maybe not
8,000 no cuz 6,000
8,000 no cuz 6,000
is uh 600 seconds
no 100 seconds yeah that's
reasonable let's see what
reasonable let's see what
uh what puffer lib
uh what puffer lib
says so puffer lib says
mostly
solved kind of
solved kind of
odd decent enough though
a wrong machine
I will now shift this
yeah and that is the same
here's pong
here's pong
agent why is it
losing this doesn't seem right to me
something's got to be different with
something's got to be different with
settings right
maybe it just had a bad start let's
see yeah know it's dropping lots of
see yeah know it's dropping lots of
points
that doesn't match the uh yeah this does
that doesn't match the uh yeah this does
not match
not match
the performance from the graph
yeah it's dropped Four
yeah it's dropped Four
Points it should drop two at
most look at the settings
FR skip is set to one here
set to one
set to one
there so something's different
yeah yeah it got 20 but it dropped some
points score function goes from - 20 to
points score function goes from - 20 to
20 to get 20 you have to not drop any
20 to get 20 you have to not drop any
points to the
points to the
opponent to your score minus opponent
score we have very high standards around
score we have very high standards around
here for agents shouldn't Max score be
here for agents shouldn't Max score be
25 why would it
be I think it's technically 21 there's
be I think it's technically 21 there's
like a last point or whatever
I mean this looks like a straight up
I mean this looks like a straight up
discrepancy well now it's doing
better just did it just have a really
better just did it just have a really
bad game Let's watch
okay you know what that's better that's
okay you know what that's better that's
a perfect win
a perfect win
right so I don't know I just had a bad
right so I don't know I just had a bad
game
game
I think we're loading the right
I think we're loading the right
model should be
fine pong is now good
yeah now these match perfectly as
yeah now these match perfectly as
well surprise it's not
well surprise it's not
perfect
perfect
um you know I am as well cuz it was
um you know I am as well cuz it was
looking perfect
looking perfect
before I'm trying to
think I change anything
I honestly think it's probably kind of
I honestly think it's probably kind of
variable like the fact that it got 20
here and then it
like did get some K spikes
it's just a matter of how much I want to
it's just a matter of how much I want to
mess with it
right like okay there's also this one
we could try this
this is actually considered a long
this is actually considered a long
Horizon task as well RS does not have
Horizon task as well RS does not have
frame
frame
skip so you can see how high the gamas
skip so you can see how high the gamas
are
I miss Max
I miss Max
bradm I got it
we'll watch this for a
second a
minute yeah do that so that I can be
minute yeah do that so that I can be
confused for an hour when it [ __ ]
confused for an hour when it [ __ ]
makes some [ __ ] up no thank you
I'll write the damn script myself when I
I'll write the damn script myself when I
want
to there's definitely some instability
to there's definitely some instability
involved
here it's like oscillating around 20
19.4 was no point in training this thing
19.4 was no point in training this thing
Beyond 20 mil right
see how this goes by
see how this goes by
comparison this will also give us a
comparison this will also give us a
little sense of
little sense of
variance oops
and see it only got to 18.8 here I think
and see it only got to 18.8 here I think
there's
variance I know it
actually dip down
more maybe this is just one that is like
more maybe this is just one that is like
unstable and has to only be trained for
I don't like it being unstable like that
though it makes sense why you would get
though it makes sense why you would get
unstable results from carbs though if
unstable results from carbs though if
you think about it
what happens if we do
what happens if we do
15 I'm actually I'm
curious I'm curious if it evals higher
so the thing I think is happening is uh
so the thing I think is happening is uh
because I'm directly sweeping to try to
because I'm directly sweeping to try to
find the best policy the
find the best policy the
fastest uh the best way to do that is to
fastest uh the best way to do that is to
find unstable
find unstable
settings so we have to account for
that eval
that eval
Min that's not the issue the eval is
Min that's not the issue the eval is
accurate the eval is uh 10% of the steps
accurate the eval is uh 10% of the steps
done again at the end um that's not the
issue okay interesting so you can see
issue okay interesting so you can see
here this did not work at
all the easiest is to keep it at 30 mil
all the easiest is to keep it at 30 mil
we'll see if it's
consistent didn't I have good settings
consistent didn't I have good settings
before what was I using
here wasn't this just better
uh so you can see what happened
uh so you can see what happened
right it found less stable
settings yeah that's exactly what
happened
happened
yeah e
here whenever you want yeah let me train
here whenever you want yeah let me train
this I'm going to go back to this
this I'm going to go back to this
one I think because even though it's
one I think because even though it's
slower
I'm trying to think what I want to do
I'm trying to think what I want to do
honestly what did this just give
me this just
me this just
gave slightly under
20 I kind of want to keep the stable set
20 I kind of want to keep the stable set
but I think we're going to go back to
but I think we're going to go back to
these
and then we'll look at your
end it's just being too aggressive as
end it's just being too aggressive as
all
you can see 0.01 learning rate it just
you can see 0.01 learning rate it just
has like crazy freaking learning
rate okay and then EPO three
that ought to be
good it's just 20 mil
maybe this will still be good we'll see
people are really mad at peer
review this post has 150k and
review this post has 150k and
841 6.2 and 202 people real mad at PE
841 6.2 and 202 people real mad at PE
review as they should be it's a mess
that looks good to
me yeah that's 20.4 yeah this is good we
me yeah that's 20.4 yeah this is good we
got
it for
get so
slow okay
slow okay
there we
there we
[Music]
go okay there's pong
go okay there's pong
forams I'm going to grab the uh the
forams I'm going to grab the uh the
policy and then I'm going to look at
policy and then I'm going to look at
your M
your M
Xander if that's good by you
long
long
agent that plays very nicely
very
good Gander oops
okay what do we looking at
where is uh your an Xander
scroll
up yeah I can't I need code though man
up yeah I can't I need code though man
to be able to tell
to be able to tell
anything like link code
I saw the print out and it looks weird
I saw the print out and it looks weird
but I need
but I need
code still in my Fork I I don't remember
code still in my Fork I I don't remember
where your fork was though unless maybe
where your fork was though unless maybe
it's do I have it
here yeah okay I found it
pick up
I'm space is
fine uh here's your problem I think let
fine uh here's your problem I think let
me
see oh you have
see oh you have
this
really I'm not going to merge this yet
really I'm not going to merge this yet
but I'll do this
we're going to figure out what's wrong
we're going to figure out what's wrong
with your
with your
end and for folks interested in
end and for folks interested in
contributing um I go through all
contributing um I go through all
contributor code like this if you get
contributor code like this if you get
stuck on stuff it's pretty easy to get
stuck on stuff it's pretty easy to get
help
which is nice because I charge companies
which is nice because I charge companies
to do the similar stuff for their
to do the similar stuff for their
proprietary
proprietary
whatever uh open source gets it for
free for
that's
bizarre you should be able to do Native
back oh is there a different
branch are you on a branch here
wait where's your
code oh
I gotta
this will take a second to build and
this will take a second to build and
then I'm going to go through the process
then I'm going to go through the process
of uh figuring out why this is slow
of uh figuring out why this is slow
hopefully there will be something cool
hopefully there will be something cool
and learnable from this but it's also
and learnable from this but it's also
possible that there's just more stuff
possible that there's just more stuff
you need to do
um is this supposed to
work I don't see the I don't think you
work I don't see the I don't think you
added it here so I don't know how this
added it here so I don't know how this
is supposed to be
working
right e
that takes forever to initialize
okay so it's like all in forward
policy looks
fine bad size
fine bad size
three so whatever you did B you have bat
three so whatever you did B you have bat
size three
size three
here that's why it's
here that's why it's
slow now I see that you actually tried
slow now I see that you actually tried
to fix
to fix
that uh so you got partway there but you
that uh so you got partway there but you
didn't
didn't
check so you did this but then you
check so you did this but then you
didn't actually check that these were
didn't actually check that these were
getting applied
getting applied
correctly it looks to
me e
okay so you actually have no Ms it's
okay so you actually have no Ms it's
getting passed correctly so this is a u
getting passed correctly so this is a u
issue not a me issue
then it's not like so perer is passing
then it's not like so perer is passing
jar
correctly are you just not doing it
your
your
M you pass it to cython right
there looks good here as
well so why
3x
56 three
56 three
agents so what's wrong
right
here right here
here right here
man you said it correctly and then you
man you said it correctly and then you
overwrote it
[Music]
actually
seg ball
yeah e
bin is z is
one we do a little debugging you
one we do a little debugging you
know we do a little debugging in our
day BS
day BS
two bins
here you have it set
here you have it set
okay yeah that's
right have you done this
yeah you changed it to one in config
yeah you changed it to one in config
it's
it's
fine okay so this thing
runs at what I would consider good rate
allocate
it for
okay next option so I can't figure out
okay next option so I can't figure out
what's
what's
wrong we're going to run GDB on python
wrong we're going to run GDB on python
which is fun
it's not going to tell us anything is
it got to love when it does that
uh does this definition match
your definition
matches
for
e e
who did not permit it
still seg faults
[Music]
[Music]
h
mm
PA for
you didn't mess up the AR
order for
initialization looks good
those are the really common ones
wonder if we can compile this
wonder if we can compile this
with I don't usually have to do this
not all members yeah that's fine
uh that actually did
uh that actually did
help yeah that actually did help
oh
oh
wait that actually gives it to us for
wait that actually gives it to us for
once
so this is out of bound
somehow you don't need to inline all
somehow you don't need to inline all
your methods by the
your methods by the
way it's generally not a good idea to do
way it's generally not a good idea to do
that you inline like little tiny helper
that you inline like little tiny helper
methods like if you're going to make
methods like if you're going to make
like a distance check function that's
like a distance check function that's
like one line you inline that don't
like one line you inline that don't
inline everything like this it like it
inline everything like this it like it
just makes the C code gigantic and
just makes the C code gigantic and
actually can slow stuff
down this is
down this is
interesting but this is where it screws
up how about static
up how about static
nah you need
that I'm going to be honest I honestly
that I'm going to be honest I honestly
forget what half the keywords even do
forget what half the keywords even do
because I don't use them because you
because I don't use them because you
don't need them
C is a very simple language if you let
C is a very simple language if you let
it
be it's interesting that this is broken
be it's interesting that this is broken
somehow for
181 really
no I have the suspicion
it's
fun
for e
get this
right working on your
right working on your
end yeah it works on my end too but then
end yeah it works on my end too but then
it seg faults
found
it probably
this e
really
e e
looks like you have like multiple weird
looks like you have like multiple weird
things going on here that's an infinite
things going on here that's an infinite
Loop
well I don't know how that's possible
well I don't know how that's possible
given I found like I found multiple
given I found like I found multiple
things
wrong so okay I'll I'll give you a
wrong so okay I'll I'll give you a
couple things to go off of from
couple things to go off of from
this um first of all you'll get a
this um first of all you'll get a
million if you just increase the number
million if you just increase the number
of M's like a thousand or
of M's like a thousand or
whatever um second of
whatever um second of
all
all
here so things I found
right I added your bindings
uh don't commit the compiled. C
uh don't commit the compiled. C
files uh hold
on so thing number
on so thing number
one is you overwrote n
thing number
thing number
two uh scyon is not the place to get
two uh scyon is not the place to get
cute with your struct
cute with your struct
definitions you want to copy your struct
definitions you want to copy your struct
definitions exactly from C you don't
definitions exactly from C you don't
want to reorder them you don't want to
want to reorder them you don't want to
emit any because you need to know what
emit any because you need to know what
you did was you told uh
you did was you told uh
scyon that the size of your struct was
scyon that the size of your struct was
different from the size the struct
different from the size the struct
actually is so when you go to Malik it
actually is so when you go to Malik it
you are malaking the wrong amount of
you are malaking the wrong amount of
bites so you want to just copy paste
bites so you want to just copy paste
brain
brain
dead paste your struct
dead paste your struct
definitions scyon and then was there
definitions scyon and then was there
anything
else nope that's it so those were the
else nope that's it so those were the
two things that I uh I found initially
two things that I uh I found initially
for
for
you fix that you'll fix your seg fols
you fix that you'll fix your seg fols
you can probably do some testing and see
you can probably do some testing and see
to fix those and you should be good
if you have time to finish those tonight
if you have time to finish those tonight
I will be able to finish reviews
I will be able to finish reviews
tomorrow and merge if it is
stable yep no
stable yep no
worries I get build errors
worries I get build errors
oh
down
e e
some of these
uh do we not have breakout
uh do we not have breakout
PR or did I merge breakout
PR oh I did merge breakout
PR great
on end
okay that'll
run and now we have
run and now we have
pong see what we
have okay so we have
have okay so we have
pong breakouts training Connect Four is
pong breakouts training Connect Four is
done snake I just have to mark and
done snake I just have to mark and
there's a little work to do on this m
there's a little work to do on this m
but I have the
but I have the
Baseline moile I just have to
Baseline moile I just have to
train and that leaves these okay we're
train and that leaves these okay we're
making good progress on Ms we're making
making good progress on Ms we're making
good progress on
MS e
okay look at that two minutes
uh this curve is not
reproducing hold on this curve is not
reproducing hold on this curve is not
acting as expected
right me check the link run
where's Spencer's
run okay so here's what it's supposed to
run okay so here's what it's supposed to
look like according dis
look like according dis
Spenser e
oh these are steps not seconds damn it
so it should
so it should
be three minutes
be three minutes
for
solve yeah there we
solve yeah there we
go this is fine I was just reading the
go this is fine I was just reading the
axis
wrong so that'll finish
wrong so that'll finish
we break out and then we'll have some
we break out and then we'll have some
other Bas lines to do with snake and
other Bas lines to do with snake and
whatnot
minutes um let me think in the meantime
so this one I just need to screw with
so this one I just need to screw with
the renderer and like default settings
the renderer and like default settings
for this and we can ship that uh MOA
for this and we can ship that uh MOA
just needs a train run it's like a on
just needs a train run it's like a on
hour train run to Mark as a
hour train run to Mark as a
basine it's like decent
basine it's like decent
enough tactics Nathan's doing
enough tactics Nathan's doing
tactics go and rware I got to talk with
tactics go and rware I got to talk with
Spence for about and then all the other
Spence for about and then all the other
ones are done so we'll have
ones are done so we'll have
five we should have five finished
five we should have five finished
baselines
baselines
today depending on if I run the Moa
experiment I might actually already have
experiment I might actually already have
that one
see all Weare should be
see all Weare should be
easy go we'll see
easy go we'll see
about TCG needs some more tactics and
about TCG needs some more tactics and
others yeah
okay this is very good though
it's kind of fiddly
the uh the score here it's kind of
fiddly actually just check one email on
fiddly actually just check one email on
the side here while we
the side here while we
uh this finish
five end done today is
good wait
oh wait
oh wait
three Enduro trash pickup yeah we'll
three Enduro trash pickup yeah we'll
have 10 we'll have at least 10
have 10 we'll have at least 10
M's uh for
M's uh for
release plus TCG and Robo code and
Dev those will be
Dev those will be
fun those will probably be what I do
fun those will probably be what I do
when either somebody can do them you
when either somebody can do them you
know people are interested in deving Ms
know people are interested in deving Ms
can do the uh additional M projects
can do the uh additional M projects
or uh I will do them whenever I get
or uh I will do them whenever I get
boarded for a couple days here and
there yeah it's definitely full
there yeah it's definitely full
solving
often for
so much
[ __ ] by the way um this cleans up
[ __ ] by the way um this cleans up
your X feed very very
your X feed very very
quickly if you just anything that's like
quickly if you just anything that's like
total
slop very very quickly
2 minutes and then then we will uh we'll
2 minutes and then then we will uh we'll
grab that policy we'll commit forams we
grab that policy we'll commit forams we
will
grab probably snake snake's like a
grab probably snake snake's like a
two-minute train run I
two-minute train run I
believe is that fully committed up yeah
believe is that fully committed up yeah
it
is
yep 850 and does it match
yep 850 and does it match
so this is my breakout it's very
so this is my breakout it's very
clean and
clean and
then spener
breakout this is Spencer one I think
breakout this is Spencer one I think
right so we guess up
to can't tell actually
oh there you go
dispensers then r
model right
model right
here yeah I think it
here yeah I think it
matches I think we have everything
right
right
yeah it's like consistently either full
yeah it's like consistently either full
solving or almost
solving or almost
full
solving so I would like this to have
solving so I would like this to have
been faster but breakout actually does
been faster but breakout actually does
usually take a stupid number of samples
usually take a stupid number of samples
to
train yeah that's actually that's a very
train yeah that's actually that's a very
clean graph look at that towards the end
clean graph look at that towards the end
here this is
here this is
perfect exactly what we want in a
baseline it does now um like 25 no 30
baseline it does now um like 25 no 30
million steps worth of evals I
million steps worth of evals I
believe and we should see the result of
that in a
moment that takes less time than
moment that takes less time than
anything
anything
else oh
so
so
see where's the eval at the end
oh it's in uh return yeah so
oh it's in uh return yeah so
857 the final on score here on episode
857 the final on score here on episode
return or
return or
whatever very
good we do so we take
this this model
break
out did you see my question on go no I
out did you see my question on go no I
did not hold on I did train your uh
did not hold on I did train your uh
breakout model I reproduce
that where is your go
question yeah Ander Happ
question yeah Ander Happ
customer uh where's your go
question I got the world I got the world
question I got the world I got the world
record on go a win rate on
record on go a win rate on
go I think it got eaten
go I think it got eaten
by
what do you want the Baseline well how
what do you want the Baseline well how
do they train do you have curves to link
do they train do you have curves to link
for
for
them by chat oh okay yeah
them by chat oh okay yeah
so uh did how like how well do they
so uh did how like how well do they
train right the different board sizes
train right the different board sizes
and like are they actually
and like are they actually
reasonable like have you played
it because it may as well be 9 by9 if um
it because it may as well be 9 by9 if um
if the opponent sucks right if the
if the opponent sucks right if the
opponent is good then it makes sense to
opponent is good then it makes sense to
go to bigger
boards e
without changing anything
fails interesting it beats 8 by8 and not
fails interesting it beats 8 by8 and not
by9 here's your breakout model
did it just do that
did it just do that
intentionally that was really
intentionally that was really
good it missed
good it missed
there no oh no it's actually it's doing
there no oh no it's actually it's doing
it isn't it it's trying to get it in
it isn't it it's trying to get it in
that I think it's trying to get it to
that I think it's trying to get it to
like Bounce from the top
cuz it's pushing it to the left yeah
cuz it's pushing it to the left yeah
yeah yeah I totally did that right look
yeah yeah I totally did that right look
that's
cool dude this is a good policy nice job
man look at
this they're way better than I am at
this they're way better than I am at
this
moves pretty smooth as
moves pretty smooth as
well uh is it frame skipping or not I
forget yeah it is frame
forget yeah it is frame
skipping oh jeez so this is like a lot
skipping oh jeez so this is like a lot
of frames then no big deal it's
fast was it harder without uh without
fast was it harder without uh without
frame skip
like I would expect it to be I would
like I would expect it to be I would
expect it to take longer at first but
expect it to take longer at first but
then to be like easier to uh to get the
then to be like easier to uh to get the
last few
last few
points in the reev what
doesn't have huge
doesn't have huge
impact go back no worries we can do that
impact go back no worries we can do that
at some point this is solid though
it doesn't know what to do at the
end oh look at
end oh look at
that first screen cleared with no lives
that first screen cleared with no lives
lost is a good
lost is a good
policy a very good policy this is a good
policy a very good policy this is a good
job this is very well
job this is very well
done I'm pleased with this
it's important to actually watch your
it's important to actually watch your
policy a
policy a
bunch make sure stuff is as you'd
expect you can see it's like trying to
expect you can see it's like trying to
get it through uh is trying to get it
get it through uh is trying to get it
through so it like bounces on the
top holy that's good
so not going to do the bounce
thing clever
thing clever
puff it doesn't it's not doing it now
puff it doesn't it's not doing it now
though I guess it just figures all right
though I guess it just figures all right
whatever we'll do it this
way to be fair it's usually riskier to
way to be fair it's usually riskier to
set up the bounce Strat
oh it lost oh it lost because I held
oh it lost oh it lost because I held
shift by mistake because I was going to
shift by mistake because I was going to
take a
take a
screenshot my
bad thing's genius
bad thing's genius
yes God
yes God
gamer all right well done
make Baseline
next should I
next should I
sweep if it's not a fundamental bug then
sweep if it's not a fundamental bug then
yes if it makes no prog if it beats 8
yes if it makes no prog if it beats 8
by8 and makes no progress 9 by9 I
by8 and makes no progress 9 by9 I
wouldn't be surprised you have an even
wouldn't be surprised you have an even
odd thing going
on I'm train the final policy for snake
on I'm train the final policy for snake
here this is a way better snake policy
here this is a way better snake policy
as well
yeah try s by seven that's a good
check go and rware are going to be I
check go and rware are going to be I
think those are the two remaining Ms
think those are the two remaining Ms
that I don't really know enough about

and uh Xander has this trash pickup end
and uh Xander has this trash pickup end
and then I've got one other end
and then I've got one other end
obviously
obviously
and uh other than that I mean we can put
and uh other than that I mean we can put
the robo code demo on or whatever the
the robo code demo on or whatever the
robo code really shouldn't be that hard
robo code really shouldn't be that hard
to like get something out there if
to like get something out there if
anybody's remotely interested like
anybody's remotely interested like
that's a pretty short and easy project I
that's a pretty short and easy project I
don't know if anybody's currently
don't know if anybody's currently
working on
it triple Triad oh yeah yeah yeah
it triple Triad oh yeah yeah yeah
um H it has a baseline I don't know if
um H it has a baseline I don't know if
it's solved we're not dropping it we
it's solved we're not dropping it we
want that M yeah I forgot about triple
want that M yeah I forgot about triple
triy it why did I forget about it it
triy it why did I forget about it it
just not on the website or
just not on the website or
[Music]
[Music]
something oh I literally just forgot to
something oh I literally just forgot to
put it there my bad yeah no triple
put it there my bad yeah no triple
triad's great of course we're going to
triad's great of course we're going to
have that
have that
I literally just forgot to put
it why would we drop it it's a good end
Gotta Love snake training at 1.2 million
Gotta Love snake training at 1.2 million
we need more M to train over a
million proud of my snake
in

e e
I am actually serious about the
uh about optimizing the Thousand calorie
mug th calorie mug is an
mug th calorie mug is an
excellent thing to optimize
7 by seven gets
7 by seven gets
solved time step cut off it should be
solved time step cut off it should be
like a fixed multile you should just
like a fixed multile you should just
make it a fix multiple of the board size
make it a fix multiple of the board size
man just make it like two or three times
man just make it like two or three times
the uh number of squares whatever you
know e
isn't there a network for

yeah here's this mobet thing
right e
on 2D is going to be in agents
what's this five
what's this five
channels oh eight
we're just making the uh the new foret

hard so what's this input
hard so what's this input
put
put
them eight channels

when I set time scap time step cap
when I set time scap time step cap
starts to
starts to
learn so my increase
learn so my increase
total total steps yeah that's what you
total total steps yeah that's what you
would do so it's just because you don't
would do so it's just because you don't
have masking it takes a really long time
have masking it takes a really long time
to figure that out
to figure that out

I don't even know if this is the right
signature let's get
this okay so
this okay so
weights um agents
makes input
dim channels is eight I believe right
dim channels is eight I believe right
yeah
yeah
um CNN channels
um CNN channels
328 and then the output dim is
very
good and then
very
nice and I would like to
I would like to make
this that was 24 snake
D snakes
nice
boarded okay
this needs to be adjusted
right still
uh o that's a totally different thing
uh o that's a totally different thing
than I expected isn't it
yeah that's just using linear
lstm this is a linear lsdm
else
to okay
Waits it's 11 time 11 dummy
s
still
no give and go is a more complex M to
no give and go is a more complex M to
solve could benefit from more parallel
solve could benefit from more parallel
M's uh most likely
yes also it'll just make these steps per
yes also it'll just make these steps per
second faster which is always
nice to be fair uh initially you're just
nice to be fair uh initially you're just
getting screwed by uh lack of masking so
getting screwed by uh lack of masking so
I wouldn't worry too too much about that
it's literally just
it's literally just
linear linear lstm
linear linear lstm
right 128
right 128
dim oh wait what why is the recurrent
dim oh wait what why is the recurrent
size 512 is that a thing no it's it's
size 512 is that a thing no it's it's
um yeah so [ __ ] coded to
um yeah so [ __ ] coded to
128 for
agents times input
agents times input
them
them
ah yeah
but this should be fine
or was that what was overflowed
oh is this it somehow
I
I
zero
really e
input dim is zero
somehow
somehow
oh that's weird put this here
yep there we go
runs real slow
there you go when you build with fast on
there you go when you build with fast on
it's good
um the agents seem rather stupid
though I take it this is not the full
policy e
I put the latest snake weights in and
I put the latest snake weights in and
that there should be way better than
that there should be way better than
this
right e
yeah you can see very quickly it's way
yeah you can see very quickly it's way
better
right e
there we go I just didn't copi the file
over
over
lovely this is kind of small and hard to
lovely this is kind of small and hard to
see even though it's visually nice uh
see even though it's visually nice uh
nice and impressive so we'll see if we
nice and impressive so we'll see if we
use this or some version some alternate
use this or some version some alternate
version of it but this is very
nice they don't all just go straight up
nice they don't all just go straight up
it's nice and balanced yeah this is
it's nice and balanced yeah this is
good and this runs cleanly as
well very
good e
okay um so so far today we
okay um so so far today we
have pretty darn nice models
have pretty darn nice models
for snake mooba
for snake mooba
[Music]
[Music]
breakout Connect Four so these four are
breakout Connect Four so these four are
pretty well set MOA we just have to
pretty well set MOA we just have to
double check
actually still know if it was marked as
actually still know if it was marked as
Baseline
yeah I guess not so we have to make a
yeah I guess not so we have to make a
baseline at some point but that's uh
baseline at some point but that's uh
good you'll do
good you'll do
go rware uh triple Triad I just forgot
go rware uh triple Triad I just forgot
to list
here let me just double check one thing
here let me just double check one thing
on uh on dinner here
okay we have half hour to finish some
okay we have half hour to finish some
stuff
up e
I literally have triple Triad there as
I literally have triple Triad there as
well I just forgot to include it I guess
see where's a good
spot snake
[Music]
the
heck oh my vmrc is
heck oh my vmrc is
not that's okay
all
fryad e
width and
height how do you get a image size
this better idea
so
982 982
994 e
can I just
do hold on
really
ah 8,000 wrong
one there we go
triple
triple
[Music]
[Music]
Triad pm
there we know there we go very
nice well not found
so resolution we still have to fix on
so resolution we still have to fix on
some
[ __ ] oh actually
990 by a th000
cool it's better
okay cool add a triple Triad to the
okay cool add a triple Triad to the
website very nice
was that
was that
120 for
[Music]
[Music]
okay got our snake end we got triple
okay got our snake end we got triple
Triad
I'm trying to think from
here for the snake
ends e
and 1280 over
and 1280 over
two yeah 640 duh
more okay that's good no
more okay that's good no
snakes 49 food
idea here is 256 snakes will be easier
idea here is 256 snakes will be easier
to run on mobile and stuff but also like
to run on mobile and stuff but also like
you'll actually be able to see them I
you'll actually be able to see them I
don't know it might still look cool
don't know it might still look cool
we'll
see still trains nice and
fast e
let's take a look at the training curve
snake oops
okay so this is what we're competing
okay so this is what we're competing
against here
getting to be quite the same size but
getting to be quite the same size but
then
then
again
again
um not clear if it should be just
um not clear if it should be just
perfectly the same I think smaller map
perfectly the same I think smaller map
should be a little bit
should be a little bit
harder cuz you can't like you can't just
harder cuz you can't like you can't just
all go in One Direction now there it
all go in One Direction now there it
goes now to
solid kind of es and flows
I wonder if that's
unstable something weird is happening
see
see
ah yeah K's
not the policy seems less well
behaved that's annoying
does seem to sort of recover a little
bit maybe
not
e e
okay so this is a little better
okay so this is a little better
right you can kind of see what's going
right you can kind of see what's going
on a little more
I think that could be cool
I don't know what what do we think
I don't know what what do we think
here this will probably run better as
here this will probably run better as
well on
well on
web still IS 250 some L of snakes in
it yeah I like that we'll run a sweep or
it yeah I like that we'll run a sweep or
something to figure out because this
something to figure out because this
thing's not
stable no big deal
pretty
cool e
all right that's a nice little finding
all right that's a nice little finding
though this is
though this is
good I think this Escape doesn't work or
good I think this Escape doesn't work or
something there we
go uh and I'm going to have to head for
go uh and I'm going to have to head for
dinner in a second
here just monitor one thing
second
where my conf go
oh
I'm very confused where my configs keep
I'm very confused where my configs keep
going because I keep editing [ __ ] and it
going because I keep editing [ __ ] and it
keeps not being reflected correctly
well I'm going to go handle uh one
well I'm going to go handle uh one
config thing and then uh I'm going to
config thing and then uh I'm going to
get
get
dinner I see my green screen is messed
dinner I see my green screen is messed
up I got to have the lights on so that
up I got to have the lights on so that
works anyways I will be uh I will be

for Spencer that I'll answer before I

longer 2048
yeah we'll just do this for you real
yeah we'll just do this for you real
quick
Spencer it's just bigger batch size man

that portion out uh but yeah it's going
that portion out uh but yeah it's going
to be a pain until then if you want you
to be a pain until then if you want you
can probably just sweep the reward like
can probably just sweep the reward like
the negative reward for illegal moves

look at OBS stuff like that and you
look at OBS stuff like that and you
should be good U I also don't even know
should be good U I also don't even know
