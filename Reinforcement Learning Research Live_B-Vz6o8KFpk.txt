Okay,
we are alive.
Hi.
Today started with um 4:00 a.m. smoke
Today started with um 4:00 a.m. smoke
detector in my ear. So, I'm half asleep
detector in my ear. So, I'm half asleep
today, but the release is done. And uh
today, but the release is done. And uh
so far it seems like not everything is
so far it seems like not everything is
on fire. So that's pretty good.
Let me uh pull up we've been doing
Let me uh pull up we've been doing
lately.
Welcome

Welcome.
So, uh, I've released a few different
So, uh, I've released a few different
things here. Almost at 500 on the
things here. Almost at 500 on the
release, which I would say is decent.

36,000 views.
36,000 views.
And then we've got uh this new article
And then we've got uh this new article
that I just posted.
that I just posted.
So, if you're interested in some of the
So, if you're interested in some of the
technical details of our release,
technical details of our release,
few of them are right here.
So, um I think here's the plan for
So, um I think here's the plan for
today.
today.
We're going to just do a little bit of
We're going to just do a little bit of
stuff on meta.
stuff on meta.
Uh I've got articles to like polish up
Uh I've got articles to like polish up
and release all week. I did push the
and release all week. I did push the
Docker build, so if you want the Docker,
Docker build, so if you want the Docker,
that is now available.
that is now available.
Uh, and other than that, yeah, I think
Uh, and other than that, yeah, I think
we're just going to see what we can do
we're just going to see what we can do
on meta since the goals for the next
on meta since the goals for the next
couple weeks are to gain a fair bit of
couple weeks are to gain a fair bit of
traction on 300. Just like tell everyone
traction on 300. Just like tell everyone
about all the stuff we've built, fix
about all the stuff we've built, fix
some stuff for the meta guys cuz they
some stuff for the meta guys cuz they
have an RLM that really should work by
have an RLM that really should work by
now, but we'll help them out.
now, but we'll help them out.
And then, um,
And then, um,
yeah, the tactical like massive multi-
yeah, the tactical like massive multi-
aent battle sim. Those are all the
aent battle sim. Those are all the
things we're going to be building.
things we're going to be building.
This is going to be a pretty easy week,
This is going to be a pretty easy week,
though. I'm not going to push too hard.
though. I'm not going to push too hard.
I'm not going to work crazy hours this
I'm not going to work crazy hours this
week. Uh we're going to consider this
week. Uh we're going to consider this
sort of transition phase between the Rio
sort of transition phase between the Rio
release and whatever I start working on
release and whatever I start working on
next to be just that, transition phase.
next to be just that, transition phase.
So hopefully we make meta have some
So hopefully we make meta have some
really nice policies. We launch some
really nice policies. We launch some
cool experiments. We clean up some stuff
cool experiments. We clean up some stuff
on 3 0. Maybe we make some cool stuff
on 3 0. Maybe we make some cool stuff
with drones. And then we're getting into
with drones. And then we're getting into
more probably this is probably going to
more probably this is probably going to
be like the heavy industry arc, frankly,
be like the heavy industry arc, frankly,
in which um
Puffer's got to grow as a company,
Puffer's got to grow as a company,
right? So we got to build more
right? So we got to build more
interesting like industry side that are
interesting like industry side that are
not just games.
Okay, so let's talk about metup. So,
Okay, so let's talk about metup. So,
first of all, I accidentally deleted my
first of all, I accidentally deleted my
Docker container like a goober
in the process of uploading the uh the
in the process of uploading the uh the
other one.
So, let's fix that real quick.
And this time we're going to follow
And this time we're going to follow
their instructions exactly.
And we're going to see uh what happens
And we're going to see uh what happens
when we do that.
I think it's probably just going to
I think it's probably just going to
break everything,
break everything,
but we shall see.
but we shall see.
Yeah, there it's downloading some jank
Yeah, there it's downloading some jank
version of PieTorch.
version of PieTorch.
Can we just like
Good day. Welcome, Finn.
Good day. Welcome, Finn.
How's it going?
Just do this.
See what this does.
I don't like that this is pinning torch
I don't like that this is pinning torch
man.
Guess we'll do it anyways.
always reinstall
Okay.
Now what we do is
Now what we do is
we attempt to render the model.
still doesn't exist.
install npm
which I hate JavaScript.
You need to install the node version
You need to install the node version
manager in order to install the node
manager in order to install the node
package manager. Wow.
We're going to very much limit the
We're going to very much limit the
amount that I have to interact with

Interacting with web programmers in

general, like I you just you get

stupider by the minute. I swear
stupider by the minute. I swear
you just get dumber by the minute.
you just get dumber by the minute.
Web is easy. Yeah, it's very easy when
Web is easy. Yeah, it's very easy when
you just write HTML and CSS. Uh it's a
you just write HTML and CSS. Uh it's a
total pain in the ass when you look at
total pain in the ass when you look at
modern web stacks. It's awful.
I literally just like open any of the
I literally just like open any of the
modern JavaScript frameworks and uh I
modern JavaScript frameworks and uh I
mean you don't even have to open the
mean you don't even have to open the
framework. Just the fact that you
framework. Just the fact that you
install a version manager to install a
install a version manager to install a
package manager is insane. Already,
package manager is insane. Already,
you've already lost.
Okay.
Okay.
Does just do this.
Where are you coming from? Most easiest
Where are you coming from? Most easiest
things.
things.
Uh I'm coming from a perspective of
Uh I'm coming from a perspective of
writing very complicated things and
writing very complicated things and
making them very simple and really not
making them very simple and really not
liking when people take very simple
liking when people take very simple
things and very and make them very

Yeah, because RL is much harder than
Yeah, because RL is much harder than
webdev. Like just fundamentally on an
webdev. Like just fundamentally on an
algorithmic level, like it is a hard
algorithmic level, like it is a hard
thing. Um, but if you look at the code
thing. Um, but if you look at the code
that we write to like do
that we write to like do
state-of-the-art reinforcement learning,
state-of-the-art reinforcement learning,
our code is simpler and easier to read
our code is simpler and easier to read
and follow than like any basic tutorial
and follow than like any basic tutorial
on modern web development.
So that should tell you something.
Now the things that will you'll run into
Now the things that will you'll run into
uh with difficulty on RL are not even
uh with difficulty on RL are not even
problems with like the aren't problems
problems with like the aren't problems
with the code, right? It's problems with

like fundamental learning dynamics and

very different from like the code is

It's possible to show us how you start
It's possible to show us how you start

how you start working with target square

end. What do you mean
like this?
So puffer train, puffer target.
It trains in 20 seconds,
It trains in 20 seconds,
25 seconds, whatever.
You can track this on Neptune or wand by
You can track this on Neptune or wand by
just adding d- Neptune or d-w.
There's training. That puffer train
There's training. That puffer train
command does the exact same thing as
command does the exact same thing as
just running pufferlib
just running pufferlib
pufferlib.pufferl.
pufferlib.pufferl.
So it's just running that script.
So it's just running that script.
There's no magic at all.
Puffer eval target load model path

if you look at the cheat sheet, this is

And then there you go. There are your

puffers.
how you train a very new custom
how you train a very new custom
environment the exact same way. So if
environment the exact same way. So if
you follow the target tutorial, it shows
you follow the target tutorial, it shows
you how to set up your own environment
you how to set up your own environment
and then that like that same training
and then that like that same training
command, that same setup, like
command, that same setup, like
everything works there. And there's even
everything works there. And there's even
like a checklist of things that can go
like a checklist of things that can go
wrong. So if you tell me like what like
wrong. So if you tell me like what like
where you are in building a new
where you are in building a new
environment and like what is confusing,
environment and like what is confusing,
I will help and possibly even update the
I will help and possibly even update the
docs for you. Hey Brad, how's it going?
docs for you. Hey Brad, how's it going?
Have you looked into active inference
Have you looked into active inference
and free energy principle before?
and free energy principle before?
Nope, not at all.
I do I'm vaguely aware though that there
I do I'm vaguely aware though that there
are like
are like
there are like separate communities that
there are like separate communities that
have kind of framed different they've
have kind of framed different they've
kind of say framed the same problems in
kind of say framed the same problems in
different ways in RL and like in
different ways in RL and like in
decision-m in general. So I don't know
decision-m in general. So I don't know
how much overlap there is versus like
how much overlap there is versus like
how many things are the same versus uh
how many things are the same versus uh
the same with different words versus
the same with different words versus
actually being different things.
the way we have things now in RL, not in
the way we have things now in RL, not in
RL literature, that's a mess. But if you
RL literature, that's a mess. But if you
look at the way that we have things now,
look at the way that we have things now,
how we do RL and puffer liib, it's very
how we do RL and puffer liib, it's very
simple.
simple.
It's like very, very simple.
Yeah, let's see if we can I'm what I'm
Yeah, let's see if we can I'm what I'm
trying to do at the moment for reference
trying to do at the moment for reference
here to people is um we've got this RL
here to people is um we've got this RL
environment.
It looks like this. This is from this is
It looks like this. This is from this is
third party. This is from uh the meta
third party. This is from uh the meta
guys.
guys.
And they've got this like factory-esque
And they've got this like factory-esque
environment here.
And uh basically we have we have models
And uh basically we have we have models
that are at least as good as theirs and
that are at least as good as theirs and
train faster, but nobody has good models
train faster, but nobody has good models
on this. And I trained really good
on this. And I trained really good
models on a previous version of this
models on a previous version of this
environment. So something's broken and I
environment. So something's broken and I
want to figure out why for them. Uh but
want to figure out why for them. Uh but
the problem is I can't really run their
the problem is I can't really run their
training code. I can't really run their
training code. I can't really run their
renderer. So, I'm kind of blind at the
renderer. So, I'm kind of blind at the
moment and I'm trying to figure out how
moment and I'm trying to figure out how
to deal with that. So, if we can at
to deal with that. So, if we can at
least get like the playable version of
least get like the playable version of
this to run.
Okay.
So this is web GPU.
What do you think
What do you think
we have to do to reach AGI?
We need to get rid of episodic training,
We need to get rid of episodic training,
etc.
etc.
Um, not really. It's not like episodes
Um, not really. It's not like episodes
or the problem or like any it's just
or the problem or like any it's just
complexity in general, right? We need to
complexity in general, right? We need to
scale this stuff to more complex and
scale this stuff to more complex and
interesting environments and the
interesting environments and the
algorithmic changes that we make along
algorithmic changes that we make along
the way need to be motivated by a
the way need to be motivated by a
combination of like very carefully
combination of like very carefully
designed probe environments in which we
designed probe environments in which we
isolate each potential thing that's
isolate each potential thing that's
wrong with an algorithm and then also
wrong with an algorithm and then also
just like actual learning at scale on
just like actual learning at scale on
complex tasks. Uh and by scale I
complex tasks. Uh and by scale I
actually I mostly mean data scale. Uh a
actually I mostly mean data scale. Uh a
really big problem with RL was just
really big problem with RL was just
everything is so slow you couldn't do
everything is so slow you couldn't do
research without thousands of GPUs. That
research without thousands of GPUs. That
is now fixed with Puffer. Uh we can do
is now fixed with Puffer. Uh we can do
research very very fast. So there's
research very very fast. So there's
algorithms work to be done. You know
algorithms work to be done. You know
there's uh there's simulator work to be
there's uh there's simulator work to be
done. Uh the road ahead is actually
done. Uh the road ahead is actually
fairly clear though now. Whereas before
fairly clear though now. Whereas before
it was just kind of a mess. Now stuff is
it was just kind of a mess. Now stuff is
pretty sane and stable and RL is like no
pretty sane and stable and RL is like no
longer cursed. RL is just a field that
longer cursed. RL is just a field that
needs progress on it now. Before it was
needs progress on it now. Before it was
like we have no idea what to do. Nothing
like we have no idea what to do. Nothing
works. All the papers are wrong. Now at
works. All the papers are wrong. Now at
least we have a basis for making
least we have a basis for making
progress.
progress.
Was it that slow? Yes, Puffer Lib is
Was it that slow? Yes, Puffer Lib is
literally more than a thousand times
literally more than a thousand times
faster than everything else.
faster than everything else.
I like that seems like a joke or an
I like that seems like a joke or an
exaggeration, but it's not.
We trained puffer lib for 10 I mean for
We trained puffer lib for 10 I mean for
30. We have a training run on one pabyte
30. We have a training run on one pabyte
of observations. That is more than 20
of observations. That is more than 20
times the amount of data used for
times the amount of data used for
training all of GPT4 and we did that on
training all of GPT4 and we did that on
one server that is sitting right behind
one server that is sitting right behind
me over there.
Do we need better reward specific? I
Do we need better reward specific? I
mean, there are a lot of things we
mean, there are a lot of things we
potentially need. You can read actually
potentially need. You can read actually
I released an article today about what
I released an article today about what
we did on the algorithm side for 3
we did on the algorithm side for 3
that's on X.
that's on X.
But um
But um
there's like some technique stuff on how
there's like some technique stuff on how
to better define observations and
to better define observations and
rewards, but I think a lot of it is
rewards, but I think a lot of it is
going to be like sane uh sane algorithm
going to be like sane uh sane algorithm
work. I would think like there's
work. I would think like there's
actually quite a bit to do on the
actually quite a bit to do on the
algorithm side and the thing is like the
algorithm side and the thing is like the
algorithm side was very very heavily
algorithm side was very very heavily
explored in RL research. There are
explored in RL research. There are
hundreds and hundreds of papers but all
hundreds and hundreds of papers but all
the experiments sucked. So like we
the experiments sucked. So like we
literally don't know if any of that
literally don't know if any of that
stuff works. Uh that was the issue. So
stuff works. Uh that was the issue. So
it's not necessarily that like oh it's
it's not necessarily that like oh it's
already all been tried. I think it's the
already all been tried. I think it's the
problem is just like nobody actually

carefully controlled anything and uh all
carefully controlled anything and uh all
the results are just invalid.
the results are just invalid.
How did you get such a huge improvement?
How did you get such a huge improvement?
We rewrote the entire RL stack from the
We rewrote the entire RL stack from the
ground up.
ground up.
That's what we did. We have our own
That's what we did. We have our own
vectorzation for parallel simulation. We

have our own optimized environment
have our own optimized environment
format. All our environments are C and
format. All our environments are C and
use that. We have our own C API to make
use that. We have our own C API to make
it easier to write that. We have like 25
it easier to write that. We have like 25
different environments now where like
different environments now where like
we've gone through the process of making
we've gone through the process of making
it really really fast and easy and
it really really fast and easy and
simple to make tons of different types
simple to make tons of different types
of sims. Um we have our own trainer
of sims. Um we have our own trainer
where like we rewrote all that from the
where like we rewrote all that from the
ground up. I it's literally you had to
ground up. I it's literally you had to
just redo the whole field.
I mean, I've this has been like I've
I mean, I've this has been like I've
been working way harder than I worked in
been working way harder than I worked in
my PhD over this. And uh it's been a bit
my PhD over this. And uh it's been a bit
over a year of just like really working
over a year of just like really working
on this to make this happen.
And that was a year that's like
And that was a year that's like
basically been informed by seven years
basically been informed by seven years
of being an RL and seeing what the field
of being an RL and seeing what the field
was like and trying to push the envelope
was like and trying to push the envelope
in academia before that.
Is there like a settings thing.
Do you have any thought on adaptive
Do you have any thought on adaptive
clip?
clip?
Adaptive clip po.
Um,
let me check for you real quick.
let me check for you real quick.
I think I do have thoughts. This is
I think I do have thoughts. This is
probably the best one that the best set
probably the best one that the best set
of experiments to use for you.
of experiments to use for you.
Let me see if I find it.
Let me see if I find it.
We'll give you thoughts informed by like
We'll give you thoughts informed by like
actually good data
actually good data
instead of just me guessing.
Okay. So, here you have it. Um,
yeah. So, I'm pretty sure, and it
yeah. So, I'm pretty sure, and it
depends on your environment, but like I
depends on your environment, but like I
don't think that you actually get that
don't think that you actually get that
much out of adaptive like adaptive
much out of adaptive like adaptive
clipping coefficient. I think that the
clipping coefficient. I think that the
main thing is that you need to have some
main thing is that you need to have some
clipping because otherwise you corrupt
clipping because otherwise you corrupt
the policy. Uh, and the amount that you
the policy. Uh, and the amount that you
have to be careful with that depends on
have to be careful with that depends on
the environment and other settings, but
the environment and other settings, but
like
like
on some like on our harder environments
on some like on our harder environments
like anything from 02 to 6ish was kind
like anything from 02 to 6ish was kind
of fine.
There's not like a very sharp peak I
There's not like a very sharp peak I
would say where it's like, oh yeah, it
would say where it's like, oh yeah, it
has to be almost exactly 02 or something
has to be almost exactly 02 or something
like that or like it could change over
like that or like it could change over
the course of training. Um, I don't
the course of training. Um, I don't
think that there's too much in that
think that there's too much in that
parameter specifically you have to worry
parameter specifically you have to worry
about.
Let me see. Is there a parameter where
Let me see. Is there a parameter where
I mean honestly stuff like the Atom
I mean honestly stuff like the Atom
betas which are like sharper could even
betas which are like sharper could even
be a reason for that. Or actually the
be a reason for that. Or actually the
one that's really important if you want
one that's really important if you want
adaptive anything it's adaptive gamma.
adaptive anything it's adaptive gamma.
All right, adaptive gamma or like better
All right, adaptive gamma or like better
yet some way to replace generalized

automatically adapts would be way way

way better.
Self-organizing approaches. Um, so stuff
Self-organizing approaches. Um, so stuff
that's like genetics inspired has
that's like genetics inspired has
traditionally been really bad and uh
traditionally been really bad and uh
yeah, it just has not worked at all. Uh,
yeah, it just has not worked at all. Uh,
but I think with Puffer now it could
but I think with Puffer now it could
kind of work. you'd at least get
kind of work. you'd at least get
something interesting. And the reason is
something interesting. And the reason is
that we can train like genetic stuff. We
that we can train like genetic stuff. We
should absolutely be able to train 10
should absolutely be able to train 10
million plus steps per second.
million plus steps per second.
So when you can do that, like we could
So when you can do that, like we could
probably do something like simulate a
probably do something like simulate a
100,000 years worth of experience or
100,000 years worth of experience or
something and then you should actually
something and then you should actually
be able to get some cool stuff out of

Um, the Rich Richard Sutton's the stuff
Um, the Rich Richard Sutton's the stuff
he's doing at Keen at the moment. I
he's doing at Keen at the moment. I
don't know what he's doing. Like the
don't know what he's doing. Like the
like the Atari robot, like the robot
like the Atari robot, like the robot
controlling Atari stuff is pretty
controlling Atari stuff is pretty
diametrically opposed from what I do and
diametrically opposed from what I do and
how I think that RL's going to be

advanced. Um, yeah,
advanced. Um, yeah,
defining their own step sizes when uh
defining their own step sizes when uh
that's kind of done implicitly.
that's kind of done implicitly.
So if you look at any of the optimizer
So if you look at any of the optimizer
work like we have muon added in that's
work like we have muon added in that's
kind of what you're doing
like you're using like you're using like
like you're using like you're using like
uh very loose curvature estimates right
uh very loose curvature estimates right
to adjust step size.
So I don't think that you need like the
So I don't think that you need like the
agent sets its own step. That's like
agent sets its own step. That's like
part of the optimizer basically and I
part of the optimizer basically and I
don't think it's specific to RL. It's
don't think it's specific to RL. It's
just generally good. And that's in the
just generally good. And that's in the
article as well. Like Muan was a big
article as well. Like Muan was a big
part of uh of 3, like changing our
part of uh of 3, like changing our
optimizer to muon.
Does anybody know how to make WebGPU

just invalid AI garbage?
Oh, it works.
Oh, it works.
Cool.
Well, it had to relaunch my chat, so I

params. Yeah, Finn. The big one right
params. Yeah, Finn. The big one right
now, the one that I'm telling you is
now, the one that I'm telling you is
like legitimately a big problem in RL is
like legitimately a big problem in RL is
the gamma lambda in uh generalized
the gamma lambda in uh generalized
advantage estimation. And gamma is way a
advantage estimation. And gamma is way a
bigger of a problem than lambda. Uh
bigger of a problem than lambda. Uh
that's adaptive horizon is what you
that's adaptive horizon is what you
need, not adaptive clipping.
need, not adaptive clipping.
All right. And like the way that gamma
All right. And like the way that gamma
does credit assignment, like
does credit assignment, like
it's like obviously really bad, but
it's like obviously really bad, but
empirically it's really hard to beat.
empirically it's really hard to beat.
That's the issue with it.

The heck?
I have a reason Chrome

Oh, I guess that works.
Cool.
Okay.
Okay.
So this is um
Still failed.
you ever considered tackling arc AGI

diametrically opposed from what I'm
diametrically opposed from what I'm
doing. You can't learn to solve those
doing. You can't learn to solve those

rely on your built-in pattern
rely on your built-in pattern
recognition from like all of your

Okay,
these all work and these are fine,
these all work and these are fine,
right? And then
right? And then
if I grab this thing.
Yay, it works.
This is ridiculously laggy.
need this image and then we will figure

out what's this end is doing.
This thing's lagging my whole PC,

If you spawn all the puffers in the
If you spawn all the puffers in the

all going to a target.
Basically, what I'm trying to figure
Basically, what I'm trying to figure
out, and we're probably going to have to
out, and we're probably going to have to
make them like all the same color or
make them like all the same color or
something.
something.
what we're basically trying to figure
what we're basically trying to figure
out to give you the idea here.
out to give you the idea here.
Let's say that there are like a bunch of
Let's say that there are like a bunch of
different easily reachable goals,
different easily reachable goals,
right? So like you could essentially you
right? So like you could essentially you
can get you can get a reward by going to
can get you can get a reward by going to
one of many goals. RL will tend to like
one of many goals. RL will tend to like
send all the agents to the first goal it
send all the agents to the first goal it
happens to find and then it won't ever
happens to find and then it won't ever
find any of the other ones. So we
find any of the other ones. So we
basically we want to play with that a
basically we want to play with that a
little bit.
Okay, be right back. I'm going use a
Okay, be right back. I'm going use a
restroom real quick and then we will
restroom real quick and then we will
figure out how this environment works.
figure out how this environment works.
I'll hook this up to hopefully print out
I'll hook this up to hopefully print out
rewards and uh yeah, we'll go from
rewards and uh yeah, we'll go from
there. I'll be right back though.
Oh, I was going to get more coffee, but
That's okay.
That's okay.
I will just suffer for the next couple
I will just suffer for the next couple
of hours without any more coffee.
You know, one of the things I've
You know, one of the things I've
noticed, I've been on like probably the

most consistent healthy schedule I've
most consistent healthy schedule I've
been on in quite a while with exercise

um it works great, but when something

gets thrown off, it's like awful.

So, fire alarm or smoke detector, I
So, fire alarm or smoke detector, I
mean, woke me up at 4 in the morning. I
mean, woke me up at 4 in the morning. I
had to go to the other building because
had to go to the other building because
it wouldn't shut up. Um,
it wouldn't shut up. Um,
and yeah, I just feel freaking exhausted
and yeah, I just feel freaking exhausted
today.
today.
That's okay.
All right.
All right.
So,
what agent is this?
Let's get some info maybe
agents.
Okay.
I don't know what agent ID I'm on.
Okay. So, this is take a heart.
Yeah.
Where's the freaking converter?
Lab red
Lab red

Would
you mind building and pushing drone?
you mind building and pushing drone?
Yeah. One second then.
Did this not push?
Oh no, it did.
the heck.
the heck.
What's wrong with this?
Wrong repo.
It looks good locally. Let's see on the
It looks good locally. Let's see on the

I think.
[Music]
I have to go grab credentials.
That that
Okay, there is your uh your push.
Okay, there is your uh your push.
Enjoy.
Enjoy.
Be live in a minute or two.
Okay, that should give me some reward,
Okay, that should give me some reward,
right?
Or does it need three hearts?
just GitHub's official CLI for O.
What do you mean?
What ends up happening is I can't it
What ends up happening is I can't it
won't cache my credentials because I do
won't cache my credentials because I do
all my dev directly in Docker. So every

time I make a new Docker container, it
time I make a new Docker container, it

I mean, technically, I could just put my

That would probably work.
That would probably work.
I think it'll like make a million

Yeah, I can work with this 100% now.
Let's do this.

Looks like you can build really fast
Looks like you can build really fast
drones for 200 bucks.
That sounds fun.
So, I am thinking about um like form
So, I am thinking about um like form
factors. I don't know how interesting

that is to you guys. And I don't know
that is to you guys. And I don't know
how like actually producing hardware at
how like actually producing hardware at
scale is quite difficult if we want to
scale is quite difficult if we want to
go that route. Um but that would
go that route. Um but that would
basically guarantee us that uh we do
basically guarantee us that uh we do
something valuable enough that we never
something valuable enough that we never
need to worry about research funding
need to worry about research funding
again and everybody involved would be
again and everybody involved would be
very happy. Um because basically like if
very happy. Um because basically like if
you got like a a decent form factor
you got like a a decent form factor
that's more agile than a quadcopter.
that's more agile than a quadcopter.
Like you just control it with cracked

Actually, I literally saw a thing on X
Actually, I literally saw a thing on X
where China has like mosquito drones now
where China has like mosquito drones now
which are horrifying. So I don't know.
which are horrifying. So I don't know.
Maybe we build some like what what eats
Maybe we build some like what what eats
mosquitoes that's fast? Hummingbirds.
mosquitoes that's fast? Hummingbirds.
Maybe hummingbirds eat mosquitoes. I
Maybe hummingbirds eat mosquitoes. I
don't know. They probably don't. We'll
don't know. They probably don't. We'll
come up with something.
Small racing drums.
Small racing drums.
Yeah. Are there any like reasonable
Yeah. Are there any like reasonable
things I can just buy that will have um
things I can just buy that will have um
like the API connectivity is important,
like the API connectivity is important,
right?
If there's like a $500 drone or
If there's like a $500 drone or
whatever, I can like
whatever, I can like
like I can like send you guys one, send
like I can like send you guys one, send
Spencer one, and buy one for myself, and
Spencer one, and buy one for myself, and
then we can just try stuff.
How will you know when your work is
How will you know when your work is
done? What is the end goal? we're going
done? What is the end goal? we're going
to make RL really, really, really good.
to make RL really, really, really good.
And then my hope is that that's going to
And then my hope is that that's going to
be very important for long-term general
be very important for long-term general
intelligence. Um,
and if it isn't, then we'll figure out
and if it isn't, then we'll figure out
what else to do. But at the very least,
what else to do. But at the very least,
we're going to have really, really good
we're going to have really, really good
reinforcement learning in a very wide
reinforcement learning in a very wide
variety of domains. It's going to be

directly useful, and we're going to
directly useful, and we're going to
apply it in a a bunch of different
apply it in a a bunch of different
domains, and then we'll go from there.
Hummingbird would be a cool prototype
Hummingbird would be a cool prototype
name. Yeah.
research parts. Yeah. I So, the thing is
research parts. Yeah. I So, the thing is
like I don't really care about like
like I don't really care about like
saving a couple hundred bucks and like
saving a couple hundred bucks and like
making you guys do a bunch of soldering.
making you guys do a bunch of soldering.
That's kind of dumb. Um
That's kind of dumb. Um
the like parts thing like building your
the like parts thing like building your
own stuff would be if we want to explore
own stuff would be if we want to explore
different form factors basically
different form factors basically
and then that would be super cool.
My hope is we can at least um
My hope is we can at least um
at least get like some like basic small
at least get like some like basic small
thing signed and then that'll be enough
thing signed and then that'll be enough
that I can like at least be send you
that I can like at least be send you
guys a stipend or whatever for this
guys a stipend or whatever for this
stuff and then if we land something
stuff and then if we land something
bigger here. We can uh figure out
bigger here. We can uh figure out
something bigger
something bigger
cuz you guys are doing really good work
cuz you guys are doing really good work
on the uh the drone end and uh you know
on the uh the drone end and uh you know
I want to make sure you get some value
I want to make sure you get some value
out of it.
Start by sending you some drones maybe.
That' be fun
across the pond if we need any inerson
across the pond if we need any inerson
jobs.
jobs.
That'd be cool.
We'll have to set up something big for
We'll have to set up something big for
that, right? Like we got so we basically
that, right? Like we got so we basically
the way puffer works, right? Puffer is
the way puffer works, right? Puffer is
not VC funded. So I have some money that
not VC funded. So I have some money that
I can fund small stuff with, but then
I can fund small stuff with, but then
bigger stuff is gota be essentially
bigger stuff is gota be essentially
directly tied to revenue, right? If we
directly tied to revenue, right? If we
get something signed where a client is
get something signed where a client is
paying us to do stuff, then I can
paying us to do stuff, then I can
actually bring people on full-time or
actually bring people on full-time or
for internships or whatever. and that
for internships or whatever. and that
can be larger.
The upside to this is I don't have VCs
The upside to this is I don't have VCs
breathing down my neck constantly, so I
breathing down my neck constantly, so I
actually get to be involved with all the
actually get to be involved with all the
cool tech.
Get rid of that bot.
No VCs is the strate. Yeah. I mean, it's
No VCs is the strate. Yeah. I mean, it's
just like look, if I were if I had to
just like look, if I were if I had to
deal with VCs, I would have collectively
deal with VCs, I would have collectively
probably spent several months raising
probably spent several months raising

Honestly, our most successful stuff,
Honestly, our most successful stuff,
like we've mostly just been doing cold
like we've mostly just been doing cold
outreach at the moment and it like it
outreach at the moment and it like it
works pretty well because like our RL
works pretty well because like our RL
stuff is getting to be decently well
stuff is getting to be decently well
known and like just the credentials are

kind of enough if people don't know any
kind of enough if people don't know any
RL stuff to at least get you a meeting
RL stuff to at least get you a meeting
and then when they see our tech, they're
and then when they see our tech, they're
pretty darn happy and then they want to
pretty darn happy and then they want to
follow up. Like we've had a bunch of
follow up. Like we've had a bunch of
meetings. It's just about finding like
meetings. It's just about finding like
good problem fits.
Man, they're doing something screwy
Man, they're doing something screwy
here, I'm sure.
So this should not get any reward and if
So this should not get any reward and if
it does something is
It took Puffer live. Yeah,
it took Puff for Live to convince them.
It's cool to see that this like more
It's cool to see that this like more
technical article is doing kind of
technical article is doing kind of
decently as well.
Okay. So,
Okay. So,
we can confidently say
we can confidently say
this thing is not doing anything, which
this thing is not doing anything, which
is good in this case.
See, there's a little bit of red
See, there's a little bit of red
battery, a little bit of red ore, bit of
battery, a little bit of red ore, bit of
heart gained, and nothing, which is
heart gained, and nothing, which is
good. But it should be
Now, can they learn to gather lots of
Now, can they learn to gather lots of
ore?
ore?
Very interesting questions that we
Very interesting questions that we
answer here.
answer here.
Low runs.
Ward goes up.
Ward goes up.
Word goes up nice and quick.
This should go up a lot because it
This should go up a lot because it
basically can just spam the button and
basically can just spam the button and
keep getting more reward. So, if it
keep getting more reward. So, if it
can't do this, it is very dumb.
Yeah, this should just keep going
Yeah, this should just keep going
straight up for basically the whole
straight up for basically the whole
episode.
Once it gets to above uh what's that 22
Once it gets to above uh what's that 22
or whatever? 24,
we'll know there isn't some weird cap.
we'll know there isn't some weird cap.
Oh, is there some weird cap?
Oh, is there some weird cap?
Huh?
Huh?
I think there's a weird cap.
I think there's a weird cap.
Probably the inventory size, right?
It's probably the inventory.
[Music]
I'll use the restroom and then we will
I'll use the restroom and then we will
be figuring out that what this is. It's
be figuring out that what this is. It's
very convinced this is all the ore you
very convinced this is all the ore you
can get.
Okay, there's definitely some sort of
Okay, there's definitely some sort of
fundamental limit here.
fundamental limit here.
This is a trivial trivial task.
This is a trivial trivial task.
I bet it's the inventory size, right?
We'll double check, but I bet that's
We'll double check, but I bet that's
what it is. So, this or this like
what it is. So, this or this like
metrics probably just scaled wrong.
Okay, so this worked immediately.
Okay, so this worked immediately.
So this is scaled wrong
So this is scaled wrong
by 24 maybe.
by 24 maybe.
Not quite.
But this red ore thing
But this red ore thing
We can see here we get 45
We can see here we get 45
reward. So this sum
reward. So this sum
is the correct thing.
And the reason for this by the way is
And the reason for this by the way is
0.5 times 100
0.5 times 100
item max. You can get up to 50 items.
item max. You can get up to 50 items.
We're very close to that. Let me see.
I think technically it starts out with a
I think technically it starts out with a
couple in it inventory.
Okay. So
next step
can we just do this
can we just do this
and have it get hearts?
and have it get hearts?
Simple question.
Oh, interestingly, it was kind of
Oh, interestingly, it was kind of
starting to like learn, I guess, to get
starting to like learn, I guess, to get
rid of hearts
or to use hearts, I guess, to get rid of
or to use hearts, I guess, to get rid of
inventory items, maybe.
I mean hopefully for the folks watching
I mean hopefully for the folks watching
you get the general gist of what I'm
you get the general gist of what I'm
trying to do here. I'm kind of sleepy
trying to do here. I'm kind of sleepy
today, but let me just sort of explain,
today, but let me just sort of explain,
right? We have this hideously
right? We have this hideously
complicated environment where like I
complicated environment where like I
think that RL should solve it very
think that RL should solve it very
easily. And in fact, I have solved it
easily. And in fact, I have solved it
with uh earlier versions of puffer lib
with uh earlier versions of puffer lib
on earlier versions of the environment,
on earlier versions of the environment,
but somehow they've like some stuff is
but somehow they've like some stuff is
just broken and it's not working
just broken and it's not working
correctly. So, uh there essentially
correctly. So, uh there essentially
there are a bunch of intermediate
there are a bunch of intermediate
objectives
objectives
and they kind of just have them all
and they kind of just have them all
thrown together. So, I'm changing it so
thrown together. So, I'm changing it so
that it only rewards for like the first
that it only rewards for like the first
really easy objective and then what if
really easy objective and then what if
we just reward for the last objective.
we just reward for the last objective.
So, like can it figure out everything
So, like can it figure out everything
end to end? I'm trying basic little
end to end? I'm trying basic little
stuff like this and I'm making sure that
stuff like this and I'm making sure that
the uh expected rewards that we should
the uh expected rewards that we should
be getting match up with the metrics and
be getting match up with the metrics and
they only seem to match up with this
they only seem to match up with this
rewards.mme. They don't actually match
rewards.mme. They don't actually match
the uh the other ones. So, I think the
the uh the other ones. So, I think the
other ones are scaled wrong and we have
other ones are scaled wrong and we have
to go off of this reward mean. And then
to go off of this reward mean. And then
basically we see from here
we see from here whether training is
we see from here whether training is
still stuck in the same spot as before.
Okay. So,
the reward mean metric is stuck, but the
the reward mean metric is stuck, but the
heart get metric goes up.
Interesting.
threeish.
These all like just stop collecting ore,
These all like just stop collecting ore,
right?
right?
This goes up and then it goes back down.
This goes up and then it goes back down.
This goes the batteries keep going up
This goes the batteries keep going up
but only to like 35 or whatever.
probably doing some like very locally
probably doing some like very locally
optimal thing.
We should probably just get the policy
We should probably just get the policy
renderer working now.
renderer working now.
We'll do that next.
Okay. 32ish
Okay. 32ish
hearts. Not very good.
Definitely do better than that.
Play done.
You done taking forever?
You done taking forever?
No.
this actually run or do they just break
this actually run or do they just break
my stuff
So dumb
Yes.
Like with the mechanics that are in this
Like with the mechanics that are in this
environment now, I could literally
environment now, I could literally
reimplement this thing in less than a
reimplement this thing in less than a
thousand lines. have it train like three
thousand lines. have it train like three
million plus steps per second and it
million plus steps per second and it
would be fine.
Noise me man.
I have to pull latest meta. So,
I have to pull latest meta. So,
literally all this does is make my life
literally all this does is make my life
harder.
Okay, I got it running again.
Make sure it's still the same.
Replay writer thing.
Replay writer.
That's Super
probably this right.
See what's in here.
See what's in here.
Right. Replay.
We back.
We back.
Oh, yeah. It's literally just the web
Oh, yeah. It's literally just the web
app. It just I guess it eats all your
app. It just I guess it eats all your
memory and dies. Very cool.
memory and dies. Very cool.
Hopefully stream is good
Hopefully stream is good
like it
Okay, it's just a compressed file.
Okay, it's just a compressed file.
That's fine.
That's fine.
So, we'll just do
So, we'll just do
puffer tank docker
puffer tank docker
and uh
and uh
replay
We'll do like this.
Dream good as always. How's it going,
Dream good as always. How's it going,
man? Hey, how you doing?
We're debugging crazy environment things
We're debugging crazy environment things
on a very difficult to figure out code.
Okay,
Okay,
I was
I was
Dang it. Now the mic is picking up my
Dang it. Now the mic is picking up my
typing since I moved it. Right, I'll
typing since I moved it. Right, I'll

Okay.
So this is web GPU.
What do you think
What do you think
we have to do to reach AGI?
We need to get rid of episodic training,

Um, not really. It's not like episodes
Um, not really. It's not like episodes
or the problem or like any it's just

complexity in general, right? We need to
scale this stuff to more complex and

algorithmic changes that we make along

isolate each potential thing that's

just like actual learning at scale on

actually I mostly mean data scale. Uh a

really big problem with RL was just
really big problem with RL was just
everything is so slow you couldn't do
everything is so slow you couldn't do
research without thousands of GPUs. That
research without thousands of GPUs. That
is now fixed with Puffer. Uh we can do
is now fixed with Puffer. Uh we can do
research very very fast. So there's
research very very fast. So there's
algorithms work to be done. You know
algorithms work to be done. You know
there's uh there's simulator work to be
there's uh there's simulator work to be
done. Uh the road ahead is actually
done. Uh the road ahead is actually
fairly clear though now. Whereas before
fairly clear though now. Whereas before
it was just kind of a mess. Now stuff is
it was just kind of a mess. Now stuff is
pretty sane and stable and RL is like no
pretty sane and stable and RL is like no
longer cursed. RL is just a field that
longer cursed. RL is just a field that
needs progress on it now. Before it was
needs progress on it now. Before it was
like we have no idea what to do. Nothing
like we have no idea what to do. Nothing
works. All the papers are wrong. Now at
works. All the papers are wrong. Now at
least we have a basis for making

progress.
progress.
Was it that slow? Yes, Puffer Lib is
Was it that slow? Yes, Puffer Lib is
literally more than a thousand times
literally more than a thousand times

I like that seems like a joke or an
I like that seems like a joke or an
exaggeration, but it's not.
We trained puffer lib for 10 I mean for
We trained puffer lib for 10 I mean for
30. We have a training run on one pabyte

of observations. That is more than 20

times the amount of data used for
times the amount of data used for
training all of GPT4 and we did that on
training all of GPT4 and we did that on
one server that is sitting right behind
one server that is sitting right behind
me over there.
Do we need better reward specific? I
Do we need better reward specific? I
mean, there are a lot of things we
mean, there are a lot of things we
potentially need. You can read actually

I released an article today about what
I released an article today about what
we did on the algorithm side for 3

that's on X.
that's on X.
But um
But um
there's like some technique stuff on how
there's like some technique stuff on how
to better define observations and
to better define observations and
rewards, but I think a lot of it is
rewards, but I think a lot of it is
going to be like sane uh sane algorithm
going to be like sane uh sane algorithm
work. I would think like there's
work. I would think like there's
actually quite a bit to do on the
actually quite a bit to do on the
algorithm side and the thing is like the
algorithm side and the thing is like the
algorithm side was very very heavily
algorithm side was very very heavily
explored in RL research. There are
explored in RL research. There are
hundreds and hundreds of papers but all
hundreds and hundreds of papers but all
the experiments sucked. So like we
the experiments sucked. So like we
literally don't know if any of that
literally don't know if any of that
stuff works. Uh that was the issue. So
stuff works. Uh that was the issue. So
it's not necessarily that like oh it's
it's not necessarily that like oh it's
already all been tried. I think it's the
already all been tried. I think it's the

How did you get such a huge improvement?

We rewrote the entire RL stack from the

That's what we did. We have our own

we've gone through the process of making

just redo the whole field.
I mean, I've this has been like I've
I mean, I've this has been like I've
been working way harder than I worked in
been working way harder than I worked in
my PhD over this. And uh it's been a bit
my PhD over this. And uh it's been a bit
over a year of just like really working
over a year of just like really working
on this to make this happen.
And that was a year that's like
And that was a year that's like
basically been informed by seven years

of being an RL and seeing what the field

Is there like a settings thing.
Do you have any thought on adaptive

Adaptive clip po.
Um,
let me check for you real quick.
let me check for you real quick.
I think I do have thoughts. This is

Let me see if I find it.
Let me see if I find it.
We'll give you thoughts informed by like
We'll give you thoughts informed by like
actually good data

instead of just me guessing.
Okay. So, here you have it. Um,
yeah. So, I'm pretty sure, and it
yeah. So, I'm pretty sure, and it
depends on your environment, but like I
depends on your environment, but like I
don't think that you actually get that
don't think that you actually get that
much out of adaptive like adaptive

main thing is that you need to have some

There's not like a very sharp peak I
There's not like a very sharp peak I
would say where it's like, oh yeah, it
would say where it's like, oh yeah, it
has to be almost exactly 02 or something

like that or like it could change over
like that or like it could change over

think that there's too much in that

about.
Let me see. Is there a parameter where

I mean honestly stuff like the Atom

betas which are like sharper could even

be a reason for that. Or actually the

one that's really important if you want

adaptive anything it's adaptive gamma.

All right, adaptive gamma or like better

Self-organizing approaches. Um, so stuff

that's like genetics inspired has

traditionally been really bad and uh

yeah, it just has not worked at all. Uh,
yeah, it just has not worked at all. Uh,
but I think with Puffer now it could
but I think with Puffer now it could
kind of work. you'd at least get
kind of work. you'd at least get
something interesting. And the reason is
something interesting. And the reason is
that we can train like genetic stuff. We
that we can train like genetic stuff. We
should absolutely be able to train 10
should absolutely be able to train 10
million plus steps per second.
million plus steps per second.
So when you can do that, like we could
So when you can do that, like we could
probably do something like simulate a
probably do something like simulate a
100,000 years worth of experience or
100,000 years worth of experience or
something and then you should actually
something and then you should actually
be able to get some cool stuff out of

defining their own step sizes when uh

that's kind of done implicitly.
So if you look at any of the optimizer
So if you look at any of the optimizer
work like we have muon added in that's
work like we have muon added in that's
kind of what you're doing
like you're using like you're using like
like you're using like you're using like
uh very loose curvature estimates right
uh very loose curvature estimates right
to adjust step size.
So I don't think that you need like the
So I don't think that you need like the
agent sets its own step. That's like
agent sets its own step. That's like
part of the optimizer basically and I
part of the optimizer basically and I
don't think it's specific to RL. It's
don't think it's specific to RL. It's
just generally good. And that's in the
just generally good. And that's in the
article as well. Like Muan was a big
article as well. Like Muan was a big
part of uh of 3, like changing our

now, the one that I'm telling you is
now, the one that I'm telling you is
like legitimately a big problem in RL is
like legitimately a big problem in RL is
the gamma lambda in uh generalized

bigger of a problem than lambda. Uh
bigger of a problem than lambda. Uh
that's adaptive horizon is what you

need, not adaptive clipping.

All right. And like the way that gamma

it's like obviously really bad, but

Why do you think it's so popular in

I mean it doesn't work for everything

Like if I want to train um like my drone

let let me think of something for you

here. Um,
here. Um,
cuz there actually there are a few
cuz there actually there are a few
simple things.
Okay, this one's I have one that's

really simple. Let me think next.
Okay, this is something really basic.

Um, but this would actually be helpful

for research. And if you're interested
for research. And if you're interested
in contributing to contributing to

research, this would be like a really
nice first step. Uh, making an basically

take my convert environment, which just
take my convert environment, which just
has all the puffers going to different

And, uh, just make the target spawn at a
And, uh, just make the target spawn at a
fixed radius from the center of the
fixed radius from the center of the
screen.
screen.
Make that radius configurable through
Make that radius configurable through
Python. So you can make it like wider or
Python. So you can make it like wider or
shallower. Um, and then have it have the
shallower. Um, and then have it have the
option to either put them at like fixed
option to either put them at like fixed
angle intervals so they're evenly spaced

in a circle around you or like randomly

place them at that same fixed radius.
place them at that same fixed radius.
The point of this is going to be we

basically we want to see if you train

to always learn to go to the same target

there's like this diversity is all you
there's like this diversity is all you
need paper thing that we were trying to
need paper thing that we were trying to
replicate and we needed like a basic
replicate and we needed like a basic
environment like this. So that would be
environment like this. So that would be
like one probe environment and then I
like one probe environment and then I
think generally we have like there's
think generally we have like there's
several of these that we would like to

have which are like environments devoted

In fact, to make it simpler, instead of
In fact, to make it simpler, instead of
randomizing the position, you can just
randomizing the position, you can just
have the flag randomize the order. That
have the flag randomize the order. That
might even be better. So then we'd see
might even be better. So then we'd see
if it's if they always go to the same
if it's if they always go to the same

you can contribute effectively.
The heck is wrong with this thing?
This thing doesn't have a setup.py Pi or

if I grab this thing.
Yay, it works.
This is ridiculously laggy.

all going to a target.
Basically, what I'm trying to figure

make them like all the same color or

Let's say that there are like a bunch of

different easily reachable goals,
different easily reachable goals,
right? So like you could essentially you
right? So like you could essentially you
can get you can get a reward by going to
can get you can get a reward by going to
one of many goals. RL will tend to like
one of many goals. RL will tend to like
send all the agents to the first goal it
send all the agents to the first goal it
happens to find and then it won't ever
happens to find and then it won't ever
find any of the other ones. So we
find any of the other ones. So we
basically we want to play with that a
basically we want to play with that a
little bit.
Okay, be right back. I'm going use a
Okay, be right back. I'm going use a
restroom real quick and then we will
restroom real quick and then we will
figure out how this environment works.
figure out how this environment works.
I'll hook this up to hopefully print out
I'll hook this up to hopefully print out
rewards and uh yeah, we'll go from
rewards and uh yeah, we'll go from
there. I'll be right back though.
Oh, I was going to get more coffee, but
That's okay.
That's okay.
I will just suffer for the next couple
I will just suffer for the next couple
of hours without any more coffee.
You know, one of the things I've

today.
today.
That's okay.
All right.
All right.
So,
what agent is this?
Let's get some info maybe
agents.
Okay.
I don't know what agent ID I'm on.
Okay. So, this is take a heart.
Yeah.
Where's the freaking converter?

Would
you mind building and pushing drone?
you mind building and pushing drone?
Yeah. One second then.
Did this not push?
Oh no, it did.
the heck.
the heck.
What's wrong with this?
Wrong repo.
It looks good locally. Let's see on the
It looks good locally. Let's see on the

I have to go grab credentials.
That that
Okay, there is your uh your push.
Okay, there is your uh your push.
Enjoy.

Be live in a minute or two.
Okay, that should give me some reward,
Okay, that should give me some reward,
right?
Or does it need three hearts?
just GitHub's official CLI for O.
What do you mean?
What ends up happening is I can't it
What ends up happening is I can't it
won't cache my credentials because I do
won't cache my credentials because I do
all my dev directly in Docker. So every

how like actually producing hardware at

go that route. Um but that would
go that route. Um but that would
basically guarantee us that uh we do
basically guarantee us that uh we do
something valuable enough that we never
something valuable enough that we never
need to worry about research funding
need to worry about research funding
again and everybody involved would be
again and everybody involved would be
very happy. Um because basically like if
very happy. Um because basically like if

don't know. They probably don't. We'll
come up with something.

Yeah. Are there any like reasonable

whatever, I can like
like I can like send you guys one, send
like I can like send you guys one, send
Spencer one, and buy one for myself, and
Spencer one, and buy one for myself, and
then we can just try stuff.
How will you know when your work is
How will you know when your work is
done? What is the end goal? we're going
done? What is the end goal? we're going
to make RL really, really, really good.
to make RL really, really, really good.
And then my hope is that that's going to
And then my hope is that that's going to
be very important for long-term general
be very important for long-term general
intelligence. Um,
and if it isn't, then we'll figure out
and if it isn't, then we'll figure out
what else to do. But at the very least,
what else to do. But at the very least,
we're going to have really, really good
we're going to have really, really good

apply it in a a bunch of different

Hummingbird would be a cool prototype
Hummingbird would be a cool prototype

research parts. Yeah. I So, the thing is
research parts. Yeah. I So, the thing is
like I don't really care about like
like I don't really care about like
saving a couple hundred bucks and like
saving a couple hundred bucks and like
making you guys do a bunch of soldering.
making you guys do a bunch of soldering.
That's kind of dumb. Um
That's kind of dumb. Um
the like parts thing like building your
the like parts thing like building your
own stuff would be if we want to explore
own stuff would be if we want to explore
different form factors basically
different form factors basically
and then that would be super cool.
My hope is we can at least um
My hope is we can at least um
at least get like some like basic small
at least get like some like basic small
thing signed and then that'll be enough
thing signed and then that'll be enough
that I can like at least be send you
that I can like at least be send you
guys a stipend or whatever for this
guys a stipend or whatever for this
stuff and then if we land something
stuff and then if we land something
bigger here. We can uh figure out
bigger here. We can uh figure out
something bigger
something bigger
cuz you guys are doing really good work
cuz you guys are doing really good work
on the uh the drone end and uh you know
on the uh the drone end and uh you know
I want to make sure you get some value
I want to make sure you get some value
out of it.
Start by sending you some drones maybe.
That' be fun
across the pond if we need any inerson
across the pond if we need any inerson
jobs.
jobs.
That'd be cool.
We'll have to set up something big for
We'll have to set up something big for
that, right? Like we got so we basically
that, right? Like we got so we basically
the way puffer works, right? Puffer is
the way puffer works, right? Puffer is
not VC funded. So I have some money that
not VC funded. So I have some money that
I can fund small stuff with, but then
I can fund small stuff with, but then
bigger stuff is gota be essentially
bigger stuff is gota be essentially
directly tied to revenue, right? If we
directly tied to revenue, right? If we
get something signed where a client is
get something signed where a client is
paying us to do stuff, then I can
paying us to do stuff, then I can
actually bring people on full-time or
actually bring people on full-time or
for internships or whatever. and that
for internships or whatever. and that
can be larger.
The upside to this is I don't have VCs
The upside to this is I don't have VCs
breathing down my neck constantly, so I
breathing down my neck constantly, so I
actually get to be involved with all the

Get rid of that bot.
No VCs is the strate. Yeah. I mean, it's

works pretty well because like our RL

and then when they see our tech, they're
and then when they see our tech, they're
pretty darn happy and then they want to
pretty darn happy and then they want to
follow up. Like we've had a bunch of
follow up. Like we've had a bunch of
meetings. It's just about finding like
meetings. It's just about finding like
good problem fits.
Man, they're doing something screwy
Man, they're doing something screwy
here, I'm sure.
So this should not get any reward and if
So this should not get any reward and if
it does something is
It took Puffer live. Yeah,
it took Puff for Live to convince them.
It's cool to see that this like more
It's cool to see that this like more
technical article is doing kind of
technical article is doing kind of
decently as well.
Okay. So,
Okay. So,
we can confidently say
we can confidently say
this thing is not doing anything, which
this thing is not doing anything, which
is good in this case.
See, there's a little bit of red
See, there's a little bit of red
battery, a little bit of red ore, bit of
battery, a little bit of red ore, bit of
heart gained, and nothing, which is
heart gained, and nothing, which is
good. But it should be
Now, can they learn to gather lots of
Now, can they learn to gather lots of
ore?
ore?
Very interesting questions that we
Very interesting questions that we
answer here.
answer here.
Low runs.
Ward goes up.
Ward goes up.
Word goes up nice and quick.
This should go up a lot because it
This should go up a lot because it
basically can just spam the button and
basically can just spam the button and
keep getting more reward. So, if it
keep getting more reward. So, if it
can't do this, it is very dumb.
Yeah, this should just keep going
Yeah, this should just keep going
straight up for basically the whole
straight up for basically the whole
episode.
Once it gets to above uh what's that 22
Once it gets to above uh what's that 22
or whatever? 24,
we'll know there isn't some weird cap.
we'll know there isn't some weird cap.
Oh, is there some weird cap?
Oh, is there some weird cap?
Huh?
Huh?
I think there's a weird cap.
I think there's a weird cap.
Probably the inventory size, right?
It's probably the inventory.
[Music]
I'll use the restroom and then we will
I'll use the restroom and then we will
be figuring out that what this is. It's
be figuring out that what this is. It's
very convinced this is all the ore you
very convinced this is all the ore you
can get.
Okay, there's definitely some sort of
Okay, there's definitely some sort of
fundamental limit here.
fundamental limit here.
This is a trivial trivial task.
This is a trivial trivial task.
I bet it's the inventory size, right?
We'll double check, but I bet that's
We'll double check, but I bet that's
what it is. So, this or this like
what it is. So, this or this like
metrics probably just scaled wrong.
Okay, so this worked immediately.
Okay, so this worked immediately.
So this is scaled wrong
So this is scaled wrong
by 24 maybe.
by 24 maybe.
Not quite.
But this red ore thing
But this red ore thing
We can see here we get 45
We can see here we get 45
reward. So this sum
reward. So this sum
is the correct thing.
And the reason for this by the way is
And the reason for this by the way is
0.5 times 100
0.5 times 100
item max. You can get up to 50 items.
item max. You can get up to 50 items.
We're very close to that. Let me see.
I think technically it starts out with a
I think technically it starts out with a
couple in it inventory.
Okay. So
next step
can we just do this
can we just do this
and have it get hearts?
and have it get hearts?
Simple question.
Oh, interestingly, it was kind of
Oh, interestingly, it was kind of
starting to like learn, I guess, to get
starting to like learn, I guess, to get
rid of hearts
or to use hearts, I guess, to get rid of
or to use hearts, I guess, to get rid of
inventory items, maybe.
I mean hopefully for the folks watching
I mean hopefully for the folks watching
you get the general gist of what I'm
you get the general gist of what I'm
trying to do here. I'm kind of sleepy
trying to do here. I'm kind of sleepy
today, but let me just sort of explain,
today, but let me just sort of explain,
right? We have this hideously
right? We have this hideously
complicated environment where like I
complicated environment where like I
think that RL should solve it very
think that RL should solve it very
easily. And in fact, I have solved it
easily. And in fact, I have solved it
with uh earlier versions of puffer lib
with uh earlier versions of puffer lib
on earlier versions of the environment,
on earlier versions of the environment,
but somehow they've like some stuff is
but somehow they've like some stuff is
just broken and it's not working
just broken and it's not working
correctly. So, uh there essentially
correctly. So, uh there essentially
there are a bunch of intermediate
there are a bunch of intermediate
objectives
objectives
and they kind of just have them all
and they kind of just have them all
thrown together. So, I'm changing it so
thrown together. So, I'm changing it so
that it only rewards for like the first
that it only rewards for like the first
really easy objective and then what if
really easy objective and then what if
we just reward for the last objective.
we just reward for the last objective.
So, like can it figure out everything
So, like can it figure out everything
end to end? I'm trying basic little
end to end? I'm trying basic little
stuff like this and I'm making sure that
stuff like this and I'm making sure that
the uh expected rewards that we should
the uh expected rewards that we should
be getting match up with the metrics and
be getting match up with the metrics and
they only seem to match up with this
they only seem to match up with this
rewards.mme. They don't actually match
rewards.mme. They don't actually match
the uh the other ones. So, I think the
the uh the other ones. So, I think the
other ones are scaled wrong and we have
other ones are scaled wrong and we have
to go off of this reward mean. And then
to go off of this reward mean. And then
basically we see from here
we see from here whether training is
we see from here whether training is
still stuck in the same spot as before.
Okay. So,
the reward mean metric is stuck, but the
the reward mean metric is stuck, but the
heart get metric goes up.
Interesting.
threeish.
These all like just stop collecting ore,
These all like just stop collecting ore,
right?

This goes up and then it goes back down.

would be fine.
