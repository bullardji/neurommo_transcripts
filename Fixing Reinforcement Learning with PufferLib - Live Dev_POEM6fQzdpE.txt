up
um oh one
row chat
thingy okay this was what I was looking
thingy okay this was what I was looking
at this function
here e
better
right and how does it look locally if we
right and how does it look locally if we
go from like
say -2 to status on neoc carbs yeah
say -2 to status on neoc carbs yeah
figuring out ideal transforms mostly
figuring out ideal transforms mostly
um the
issue is that with certain types of
issue is that with certain types of
data you need a meaningful
data you need a meaningful
interpretation of absolute Improvement
interpretation of absolute Improvement
of score but like your data could be
of score but like your data could be
percentile it could be log distributed
percentile it could be log distributed
it could be linear so uh I'm looking for
it could be linear so uh I'm looking for
something here that we can that we can
something here that we can that we can
use
it's locally pretty nice and
linear what transform they use their
linear what transform they use their
quanti transform doesn't work with
quanti transform doesn't work with
percentile data and also it's a pain in
percentile data and also it's a pain in
the ass it's like ridiculously overly
the ass it's like ridiculously overly
complicated for what it
is also a lot of their stuff just
is also a lot of their stuff just
doesn't work
doesn't work
so
yeah I think that they like the thing is
yeah I think that they like the thing is
they mostly got the result that they did
they mostly got the result that they did
because they were the first ones to run
because they were the first ones to run
a
a
um a large scale hyper parameter sweep
um a large scale hyper parameter sweep
on proen at all um the algorithm was
on proen at all um the algorithm was
like okay but it was more that the idea
like okay but it was more that the idea
is very good and there's a lot that
is very good and there's a lot that
needed improving on
needed improving on
it
it
yeah well because here this is the type
yeah well because here this is the type
of thing that happens right stupid
of thing that happens right stupid
researchers say that like oh here's
researchers say that like oh here's
proin you're supposed to solve it with
proin you're supposed to solve it with
one set of hyper parameters and then
one set of hyper parameters and then
nobody bothers to like think that wait a
nobody bothers to like think that wait a
second we're using Po and like all these
second we're using Po and like all these
other algorithms that have time
other algorithms that have time
dependent hyperparameters like gamma and
dependent hyperparameters like gamma and
Lambda and these inherently are
Lambda and these inherently are
different for environment and we're
different for environment and we're
trying to force one set to solve all the
trying to force one set to solve all the
environments which is never going to
environments which is never going to
work so we're just going to sit here and
work so we're just going to sit here and
like say oh it's hard we can't solve it
like say oh it's hard we can't solve it
instead of just tuning the damn hyper
instead of just tuning the damn hyper
parameters right so it's like
parameters right so it's like
ridiculous well also proen is uh the
ridiculous well also proen is uh the
like here's the other annoying thing
like here's the other annoying thing
procgen the environment is quite fast
procgen the environment is quite fast
procgen the base model that everyone
procgen the base model that everyone
uses for it is very slow so basically
uses for it is very slow so basically
even if you give researchers nice things
even if you give researchers nice things
they will find a way to ruin
them yeah this is pretty good it's like
them yeah this is pretty good it's like
close to linear
close to linear
locally yep pixels is
locally yep pixels is
inputs we have to learn from pixels oh
inputs we have to learn from pixels oh
so you have compute right no we're
so you have compute right no we're
Academia we have uh we have $500,000
Academia we have uh we have $500,000
budget for compute oh that's pretty good
budget for compute oh that's pretty good
so you're going to buy like you know a
so you're going to buy like you know a
bunch of desktops or something right oh
bunch of desktops or something right oh
no we're going to buy h00 and then we're
no we're going to buy h00 and then we're
going to run them at 10% utilization and
going to run them at 10% utilization and
like
like
it's it's just like lighting money on
it's it's just like lighting money on
fire like they light performance on fire
fire like they light performance on fire
they light money on fire drives me
they light money on fire drives me
absolutely
insane how did I get puffer off the
insane how did I get puffer off the
ground by buying some desktops putting
ground by buying some desktops putting
them in a
garage it drives me insane
man isn't seeing like humans are what's
man isn't seeing like humans are what's
the point what are we even doing
the point what are we even doing
exactly if it isn't see like humans
are after all us humans are so smart
are after all us humans are so smart
we're the only species capable of

building amazing things then utilizing
building amazing things then utilizing
them at 1 10,000 deficiency
all this is a pretty good
transform you got to at 11,000
efficiency e
let's try this
out and then my favorite part is that
out and then my favorite part is that
then the scientists
then the scientists
decid the science positions are more
decid the science positions are more
prestigious than the engineering
prestigious than the engineering
positions it's like what are you guys
positions it's like what are you guys
doing
my favorite thing is now because I'm the
my favorite thing is now because I'm the
scientist I get to complain about this
scientist I get to complain about this
and it's not even lame
and it's not even lame
anymore it's like lame when it's like
anymore it's like lame when it's like
the engineer complains why the scientist
the engineer complains why the scientist
think they're so cool but now it's like
think they're so cool but now it's like
I can actually say stuff and it's like
I can actually say stuff and it's like
it
it
works it's the best part
and I can be like hey a scientist write
and I can be like hey a scientist write
code that doesn't make my eyes
bed this makes my eyes bleed for

diminish
diminish
results it's the
opposite you see what happens
is so eight
is so eight
19 or was it here 15 - 14 = 1 right 20 -
19 or was it here 15 - 14 = 1 right 20 -
19 is also equal to one but going from
19 is also equal to one but going from
19 to 20 is you're solving the task and
19 to 20 is you're solving the task and
going from 15 to 14 is a very small
going from 15 to 14 is a very small
Improvement and the same exact thing
Improvement and the same exact thing
happens with percentile data right going
happens with percentile data right going
from 0.9 to 0.999 is huge going from
from 0.9 to 0.999 is huge going from
like 08 to 0.9 is not as huge
for
for
e e
uh well that's because Claude is very
stupid oh did you see there was a
stupid oh did you see there was a
hilarious thing in one of the uh the
hilarious thing in one of the uh the
Twitter chats where
like somebody put in the uh the US
like somebody put in the uh the US
tariffs plan and Claude like could not
tariffs plan and Claude like could not
fathom how it would even be possible and
fathom how it would even be possible and
was like predicting that you know the US
was like predicting that you know the US
Supply would be replaced by like the
Supply would be replaced by like the
farm supply would be replaced by
farm supply would be replaced by
products from Asia and the US would
products from Asia and the US would
crumble and whatever and 24 hours
crumble and whatever and 24 hours
later 24 hours later it's like yeah nope
later 24 hours later it's like yeah nope
that
that
worked oh it's
ridiculous CL is not very
ridiculous CL is not very
smart for
okay so this gives you transforms for
okay so this gives you transforms for
but I need to have like
like
this we
normalize Twitter is not good for you
normalize Twitter is not good for you
it's very bad for
you R1 you talk about H
code he sends all the data straight to

China
China
unless you're running it
locally of course open uh chat GPT sends
locally of course open uh chat GPT sends
all the data to open AI I don't know
all the data to open AI I don't know
which one is
worse me a data Hogs I have to set up
worse me a data Hogs I have to set up
our own private puffer cluster for

training on puffer code I'm just going
training on puffer code I'm just going
to like find and extract bits of puffer
to like find and extract bits of puffer
code and be like hey see the coding

finally trained on some good code you're
welcome for
I think I did this right
activations in
place are you sure that's not for
place are you sure that's not for
inference
I guess you could use it in the roll out
I guess you could use it in the roll out
collection
stage yeah cuz it'll destroy your

gradients if you use it for training
well you're free to investigate anything
well you're free to investigate anything
but I suggest uh what you do is you know
but I suggest uh what you do is you know
you make a table in science what you do
you make a table in science what you do
is you make a table
is you make a table
of things that are likely to be useful
of things that are likely to be useful
and then you rank them from by How
and then you rank them from by How
likely they are to be useful and how
likely they are to be useful and how
useful they're likely to be
useful they're likely to be
morning and then you do them in
morning and then you do them in
approximately that
order modu what you find
interesting for
redo my web server that's obnoxious
H so it's not
H so it's not
happy it should
happy it should
be oh because I have the wrong Max in
be oh because I have the wrong Max in
there okay so yeah this is what it is
there okay so yeah this is what it is
with a completely screw a Max and then
with a completely screw a Max and then
the max should actually here be
one
1.0 let's try this
oh even
lower oh we'll have to look at this
oh wait we don't want untransformed
oh wait we don't want untransformed
squore me we want a normalized square
yeah we don't want to undo the transform
yeah we don't want to undo the transform
the whole point is to have the
transform okay so this thing doesn't
transform okay so this thing doesn't
work either right here now what about
this invalid value
it's a little
better uh it's breaking because the
better uh it's breaking because the
predicted score is um
mhm yeah it's breaking with the
mhm yeah it's breaking with the
predicted
score CL are a little
score CL are a little
better little better than before
raw scores come
raw scores come
in you get the transform
in you get the transform
scores want five is probably good
the suggestions come in
okay so this is a little better you see
okay so this is a little better you see
we actually have some points out
we actually have some points out
here we don't go out to here
though reason being the predictions are
though reason being the predictions are
all
all
one predictions should not all be
one these should be very nicely
one these should be very nicely
separated in latent space
let me see if I I'm undoing it
wrong and we want to log untransformed
wrong and we want to log untransformed
work me
right e
the
heck it's
weird um a normalized
let's put a break point like here
me double check
me double check
uh some
uh some
messages
messages
oops I love when auntu can't update
oops I love when auntu can't update
itself
normally not that bad to update at least
so I'm good I don't have anything for a
so I'm good I don't have anything for a
few
hours
hours
puff Puffer
okay normalized score
okay normalized score
mean
mean so it's scan carbs today work today
mean so it's scan carbs today work today
various work I'm basically just stealing
various work I'm basically just stealing
time to work on this whenever I can cuz
time to work on this whenever I can cuz
I have a million other projects um that
I have a million other projects um that
need to get done but this one is very
need to get done but this one is very
very very important to RL progress so
very very important to RL progress so
whenever I can I work on this and
whenever I can I work on this and
um I have some robotic stuff that has to
um I have some robotic stuff that has to
get done I got some other client stuff
get done I got some other client stuff
that's got to get done today but uh you
that's got to get done today but uh you
know whenever I can do
know whenever I can do
this I do
this this is like the thing that in my
this this is like the thing that in my
mind at the moment this needs to happen
mind at the moment this needs to happen
so RL moves forward if this does not
so RL moves forward if this does not
happen RL does not move forward period
happen RL does not move forward period
so that's
simple I think in those sorts of terms
simple I think in those sorts of terms
you
know all right so something screwing
know all right so something screwing
here
because what we do transform
scores did I undo it wrong hang on I
scores did I undo it wrong hang on I
think I undid it
wrong you take
wrong you take
unnormalized but this is the transform
unnormalized but this is the transform
right so negative
right so negative
log so you
log so you
dox
dox
right and then this gives you minus
this oh so yeah I'm just
this oh so yeah I'm just
trolling my
bad and then what you have to do is you
bad and then what you have to do is you
do this minus what is
do this minus what is
it -1 +
it -1 +
x and then you
x and then you
multiply Max score
I don't know why it is that the
I don't know why it is that the
autocomplete just breaks sometimes like
autocomplete just breaks sometimes like
it should be completing this right and
it should be completing this right and
it's just not it's like come on I'm
it's just not it's like come on I'm
paying for auto complete you going to
paying for auto complete you going to
make me type
this does it just stop yeah
let me do this before I uh at them on
let me do this before I uh at them on

supposed to
supposed to
be it's like instant when it

transform space isn't it
no no no no something's screwy here let
no no no no something's screwy here let
me see

course there we
course there we

do man
we're going to start cleaning this up at
we're going to start cleaning this up at
some point very soon here so I stop
some point very soon here so I stop
making these dumb
mistakes for

go that looks way
better and I think I missed a negative
better and I think I missed a negative

how did I miss a negative

it isn't you come tell me and I fix
it uh you can't use puffer tank is the

right here there's like I don't know 50
right here there's like I don't know 50
lines of log code just use

enough then yes I can look at code
enough then yes I can look at code

Also let's see did we get anything from
um want to see if I got
um want to see if I got
any oh
any oh
yeah at this did anybody actually go
yeah at this did anybody actually go
Star
it why is this thing not
load I think we got a few
every so often you got to do the star
promo invalid and log
promo invalid and log
ah so how's there an invalid and log
ah so how's there an invalid and log
here anything think
oh wait log of zero is
one then what was I afraa of
one then what was I afraa of
here is this plus
apps I think it a plus apps isn't
it
it
mm so that's got to be minus Epsilon
solid
these look way
better 998 score 998
it's overconfident in a couple
places why is it let the predicted score
places why is it let the predicted score
get up that high
ideally it should get
clipped but I think this is way better
clipped but I think this is way better
already
let's
see hey look at that so we've
see hey look at that so we've
got
got
603s still doesn't go that far
603s still doesn't go that far
out look at this curve though look how
out look at this curve though look how
nicely it filled this in holy look at
nicely it filled this in holy look at
this
this
where's
this look at this right here you see
this look at this right here you see
this perfect
fill that's a perfect parito front right
fill that's a perfect parito front right
there
setup docs puffer
doai all our
stuff single page super
easy yeah this synthetic test
easy yeah this synthetic test
man but we're we're looking at different
man but we're we're looking at different
common data distributions and making
common data distributions and making
sure that it can actually work because
sure that it can actually work because
here's the thing base carbs horribly
here's the thing base carbs horribly
fails the synthetic test as do most
fails the synthetic test as do most
other
other
algorithms so if it can't freaking
algorithms so if it can't freaking
figure it out in the case where it has
figure it out in the case where it has
perfect data and a very good model then
perfect data and a very good model then
what's it going to do
i' like to rescale the percentile test
i' like to rescale the percentile test
just a little bit
here need to be just a little shallower
plus wait
score one plus how's this
work how the heck does this percentile
work how the heck does this percentile
task work am I dumb
okay so this is 0 to
one oh I see
let me see how this
looks that it's just there are some
looks that it's just there are some
optimal hyper prams they're not
optimal hyper prams they're not
randomized and I'm fitting it to a curve
randomized and I'm fitting it to a curve
so I have like a uh there's like a
so I have like a uh there's like a
linear one a log one and a percentile
linear one a log one and a percentile
one this is strictly to test out um the
one this is strictly to test out um the
interaction of various terms in the
interaction of various terms in the
objective
function there we go that's way more
function there we go that's way more
reasonable
and then what's Happening Here is it's
and then what's Happening Here is it's
not getting
not getting
perfect even at high cost because the
perfect even at high cost because the
model
model
is oh no this one's decent hold
is oh no this one's decent hold
on plus 30
yeah okay look at that that's there
yeah okay look at that that's there
we're
good okay so I rescaled it just so it
good okay so I rescaled it just so it
wouldn't all Bunch up here so much um
wouldn't all Bunch up here so much um
it's still a good test
right I might have gone a little too
right I might have gone a little too
heavy on
heavy on
it we do cost over 10
it we do cost over 10
instead that cuz I want to see that it
instead that cuz I want to see that it
can like fill in this steep Reg in
here so I mean but this is still pretty
here so I mean but this is still pretty
good here
good here
like here's all the random data and you
like here's all the random data and you
see that it actually it filled in mostly
see that it actually it filled in mostly
what we would
want so it filled in right here and it
want so it filled in right here and it
filled in even over here these points
I especially like how it's got like this
I especially like how it's got like this
dense coverage of the elbow
here and there's there are a couple
here and there's there are a couple
points like down here and stuff as well
points like down here and stuff as well
so like it is actually going to cover
so like it is actually going to cover
the lower regions but yeah yeah this is
good and if we make the task a little
good and if we make the task a little
more aggressively uh cut
off actually works
better I guess it makes sense they just
better I guess it makes sense they just
didn't have support before and here I
didn't have support before and here I
see that there are a couple higher
see that there are a couple higher
samples okay
see so we did this we did this and now
see so we did this we did this and now
we do
we do
whoops we do
this oh
yeah look at that
check the logging against pong would you
check the logging against pong would you
mind taking a look
mind taking a look
y uh let me know what is wrong with it
y uh let me know what is wrong with it
and I assume the changes are pushed to

the same place as
the same place as
before and go find
it looking where' It
it looking where' It

yeah you just paste the logging

far is it not working for
far is it not working for
you you got log buffer added
you you got log buffer added
in here's your log
in here's your log
buffer there
yeah so I mean that all looks
yeah so I mean that all looks
fine um is something not working
back go
score and reward are always the
score and reward are always the
same and the values keep
same and the values keep
disappearing well that's log frequency
disappearing well that's log frequency
values disappearing is just they're not
values disappearing is just they're not
getting logged frequently enough most
getting logged frequently enough most
likely uh but which would be very weird
likely uh but which would be very weird
with a report interval of one but if you
with a report interval of one but if you
have a very small batch size that's
have a very small batch size that's
still
still
possible and like you have config any
h no you have a reasonable batch I don't
h no you have a reasonable batch I don't
know where you got these parameters from
know where you got these parameters from
these are moderately unhinged
these are moderately unhinged
parameters um the 4 d96 mini batch is
parameters um the 4 d96 mini batch is
Tiny compared to the batch size in
Tiny compared to the batch size in
particular uh let me see science
have you rendered
it is there a
it is there a
render oh you guys didn't add a
render oh you guys didn't add a
renderer you should add a renderer it
renderer you should add a renderer it
won't be very much code um because
won't be very much code um because
usually my debugging routine for this
usually my debugging routine for this
stuff is like there's a c build where
stuff is like there's a c build where
you just build it and see right so it's
you just build it and see right so it's
a standalone and then I just will watch
a standalone and then I just will watch
what the agent is doing and I'll print
what the agent is doing and I'll print
out the rewards it's doing stuff and see
out the rewards it's doing stuff and see
if it's
if it's
correct so I would add like a little
renderer it's just like a point in 3D
renderer it's just like a point in 3D
space
right mm and
any that's probably confusing
any that's probably confusing
huh all right because you're using the
huh all right because you're using the
ocean you're using ocean you have a
ocean you're using ocean you have a
native environment uh this is when you
native environment uh this is when you
make your environment class right your
make your environment class right your
like drone end in internally it's going
like drone end in internally it's going
to have
to have
1,24 different
1,24 different
environments uh regardless of whether
environments uh regardless of whether
you're using Ocean or you're using like
you're using Ocean or you're using like
Atari that doesn't have the ability to
Atari that doesn't have the ability to
do this the number of environments here
do this the number of environments here
is the number of these whole things that
is the number of these whole things that
it's going to spawn so if you set this
it's going to spawn so if you set this
to two now you have 20 48
to two now you have 20 48
environments and the cool thing is
environments and the cool thing is
technically like let's say that your m
technically like let's say that your m
is fast but not quite fast enough you
is fast but not quite fast enough you
can set this to two you can keep this at
can set this to two you can keep this at
one and then it's asynchronous so it
one and then it's asynchronous so it
actually will trade off between blocks
actually will trade off between blocks
of 1040 ,24
environments but I'd add a basic little
environments but I'd add a basic little
render dis Spenser
render dis Spenser
[Music]
around let me link you his
thing he's he has some example code
let me find an older version before he
let me find an older version before he
made all these changes for you
okay here is your
okay here is your
link it's in the Discord uh that gives
link it's in the Discord uh that gives
you a very very basic example on 3D
you a very very basic example on 3D
rendering you literally just need like
rendering you literally just need like
an empty
an empty
scene with you know a sphere for your
scene with you know a sphere for your
drone and if there objectives or places
drone and if there objectives or places
that it's going to go to put a sphere
that it's going to go to put a sphere
over there as well and you'll be able to
over there as well and you'll be able to
see what's going on there you go
so this thing here
speeding up the
ball that would be an environment
config that would change the way the
config that would change the way the
game plays
okay
okay
171 so this point yeah right here this
171 so this point yeah right here this
is the best
point and this gets high
rating it's over predicting a little
bit should cap it at
bit should cap it at
least does that even
least does that even
help maybe helps a little bit
I guess it is factored into Epsilon with
I guess it is factored into Epsilon with
the
Epsilon Transformers are pretty
good Transformers are pretty
good Transformers are pretty
good I mean there's still a lot to do
here try this on log real quick
not 200 right
hang
on log
2.3 for
it does somewhat bother me that it's
it does somewhat bother me that it's
chosen not to fill out this area but the
chosen not to fill out this area but the
thing is I think that this is so densely
thing is I think that this is so densely
Filled from the initial Point estimates
Filled from the initial Point estimates
that this should be fine and I saw it
that this should be fine and I saw it
fill this point in uh this portion in
before so I think it's probably fine and
before so I think it's probably fine and
actually these points here are from I
actually these points here are from I
think these points here are from uh the
think these points here are from uh the
algorithm right yeah yeah these points
algorithm right yeah yeah these points
here as well so it is doing
here as well so it is doing
it okay so this is very good there's
it okay so this is very good there's
even one over
here
nams
nams oh I think you have to go you have
nams oh I think you have to go you have
to overestimate not underestimate that's
to overestimate not underestimate that's
why if you're going to
why if you're going to
estimate it again
the next thing captain on this is going
the next thing captain on this is going
to be to figure out
to be to figure out
um why the variance of the predictions
um why the variance of the predictions
is significantly overestimating the
is significantly overestimating the
confidence of these models like these
confidence of these models like these
models are way too confident even when
models are way too confident even when
they're very wrong and then uh
they're very wrong and then uh
incorporating conservative bounds
because basically I have it here this
because basically I have it here this
just works when there's no noise and um
just works when there's no noise and um
you have a good gussian process model of
you have a good gussian process model of
Cl for or at least a pretty good
Cl for or at least a pretty good
one so we have to figure out
one so we have to figure out
why uh why these are so overly
confident e
hey that's pretty
hey that's pretty
nice introduce some noise
but the thing is it's wrong
but the thing is it's wrong
so
so
yeah this pretty good though look at
this this is
solid let's see if linear screws it up
solid let's see if linear screws it up
now because of the transform that we
now because of the transform that we
applied
I think this is a good Transformer I
I think this is a good Transformer I
think we finally found the good
transform
e e
okay this is
okay this is
suspicious I think we broke linear
hang on I think we broke the easy test
hang on I think we broke the easy test
by solving the hard
test don't you love it when you do that
test don't you love it when you do that
now you have the harder
now you have the harder
one yeah freaking
thing
thing
well and not terrible to be
honest it's actually come to think of it
honest it's actually come to think of it
this is not a bad outcome
because hold on maybe this is a feature
because hold on maybe this is a feature
not a
not a
bug all right maybe this is a feature
bug all right maybe this is a feature
not a
bug can we sell this as a
feature I think we canell this is a
feature I think we canell this is a
feature so hear me out all right you
feature so hear me out all right you
almost never see this
almost never see this
curve um in reinforcement learning like
ever the only time you see this curve is
ever the only time you see this curve is
basically when you like you learn a
basically when you like you learn a
perfect policy or whatever and you just
perfect policy or whatever and you just
have to run it for longer uh in order to
have to run it for longer uh in order to
like get the higher and higher
like get the higher and higher
score and maybe you make very small
score and maybe you make very small
refinements along the way I've only ever
refinements along the way I've only ever
seen this in
seen this in
Enduro now if that is the
Enduro now if that is the
case then there's absolutely no reason
case then there's absolutely no reason
to explore the lower cost hyper pram
to explore the lower cost hyper pram
space here as
space here as
much in fact the only reason to explore
much in fact the only reason to explore
it is if your model is not
it is if your model is not
confident in its predictions so you use
confident in its predictions so you use
it to bootstrap the uh the confidence
it to bootstrap the uh the confidence
up so uh and then in reality here this
up so uh and then in reality here this
cost this Max this score what would this
be how would you set a Max score on
be how would you set a Max score on
something like
that we're probably going to have to
that we're probably going to have to
come up with something where like if you
come up with something where like if you
don't give it a Max score we come up
don't give it a Max score we come up
with
one maybe it's double your current Max
I mean this isn't even bad like you fill
I mean this isn't even bad like you fill
out some points it misses a couple but
out some points it misses a couple but
this is a model quality problem so we'll
this is a model quality problem so we'll
handle that
handle that
separately it's generally pretty
separately it's generally pretty
good did it have any really bad misses
here 140 at
125 wait how' it do that
that shouldn't be possible
right we log
right we log
him untransformed
oh no no we're good we're good that's
oh no no we're good we're good that's
possible yeah yeah because look the
possible yeah yeah because look the
prediction is just wrong by a bit see we
prediction is just wrong by a bit see we
actually it's cost 120 and we only get
actually it's cost 120 and we only get
119 was fine this is actually even a
119 was fine this is actually even a
good this is actually even a a good
good this is actually even a a good
point this doesn't miss too bad so none
point this doesn't miss too bad so none
of these are really bad misses some of
of these are really bad misses some of
them off by a bit but none of them are
them off by a bit but none of them are
like really bad
like really bad
misses it's about like this distance
misses it's about like this distance
it's fine
it's fine
all right um nearby distant rating mean
all right um nearby distant rating mean
so rating is the overall score where
so rating is the overall score where
highest rating is the one that gets
highest rating is the one that gets
picked to be sampled and um the nearby
picked to be sampled and um the nearby
distance we're evaluating distance to
distance we're evaluating distance to
nearest Paro point and using that as
nearest Paro point and using that as
part of our uh our search
criteria I happy with this
so we fixed uh we have fixed output
so we fixed uh we have fixed output
scaling
now I think we just look at model
now I think we just look at model
variants model variants will be the next
variants model variants will be the next
topic but I'm going to go get breakfast

go get breakfast go for a run do some

row chat
thingy okay this was what I was looking
thingy okay this was what I was looking
at this function
here e
better
right and how does it look locally if we
right and how does it look locally if we
go from like
say -2 to status on neoc carbs yeah
say -2 to status on neoc carbs yeah
figuring out ideal transforms mostly
figuring out ideal transforms mostly
um the
issue is that with certain types of
issue is that with certain types of
data you need a meaningful
data you need a meaningful
interpretation of absolute Improvement
interpretation of absolute Improvement
of score but like your data could be
of score but like your data could be
percentile it could be log distributed
percentile it could be log distributed
it could be linear so uh I'm looking for
it could be linear so uh I'm looking for
something here that we can that we can
something here that we can that we can
use
it's locally pretty nice and
linear what transform they use their
linear what transform they use their
quanti transform doesn't work with
quanti transform doesn't work with
percentile data and also it's a pain in
percentile data and also it's a pain in
the ass it's like ridiculously overly
the ass it's like ridiculously overly
complicated for what it
is also a lot of their stuff just
is also a lot of their stuff just
doesn't work
doesn't work
so
yeah I think that they like the thing is
yeah I think that they like the thing is
they mostly got the result that they did
they mostly got the result that they did
because they were the first ones to run
because they were the first ones to run
a
a
um a large scale hyper parameter sweep
um a large scale hyper parameter sweep
on proen at all um the algorithm was
on proen at all um the algorithm was
like okay but it was more that the idea
like okay but it was more that the idea
is very good and there's a lot that
is very good and there's a lot that
needed improving on
needed improving on
it
it
yeah well because here this is the type
yeah well because here this is the type
of thing that happens right stupid
of thing that happens right stupid
researchers say that like oh here's
researchers say that like oh here's
proin you're supposed to solve it with
proin you're supposed to solve it with
one set of hyper parameters and then
one set of hyper parameters and then
nobody bothers to like think that wait a
nobody bothers to like think that wait a
second we're using Po and like all these
second we're using Po and like all these
other algorithms that have time
other algorithms that have time
dependent hyperparameters like gamma and
dependent hyperparameters like gamma and
Lambda and these inherently are
Lambda and these inherently are
different for environment and we're
different for environment and we're
trying to force one set to solve all the
trying to force one set to solve all the
environments which is never going to
environments which is never going to
work so we're just going to sit here and
work so we're just going to sit here and
like say oh it's hard we can't solve it
like say oh it's hard we can't solve it
instead of just tuning the damn hyper
instead of just tuning the damn hyper
parameters right so it's like
parameters right so it's like
ridiculous well also proen is uh the
ridiculous well also proen is uh the
like here's the other annoying thing
like here's the other annoying thing
procgen the environment is quite fast
procgen the environment is quite fast
procgen the base model that everyone
procgen the base model that everyone
uses for it is very slow so basically
uses for it is very slow so basically
even if you give researchers nice things
even if you give researchers nice things
they will find a way to ruin
them yeah this is pretty good it's like
them yeah this is pretty good it's like
close to linear
close to linear
locally yep pixels is
locally yep pixels is
inputs we have to learn from pixels oh
inputs we have to learn from pixels oh
so you have compute right no we're
so you have compute right no we're
Academia we have uh we have $500,000
Academia we have uh we have $500,000
budget for compute oh that's pretty good
budget for compute oh that's pretty good
so you're going to buy like you know a
so you're going to buy like you know a
bunch of desktops or something right oh
bunch of desktops or something right oh
no we're going to buy h00 and then we're
no we're going to buy h00 and then we're
going to run them at 10% utilization and
going to run them at 10% utilization and
like

absolutely
insane how did I get puffer off the

them at 1 10,000 deficiency
all this is a pretty good
transform you got to at 11,000
efficiency e
let's try this
out and then my favorite part is that
out and then my favorite part is that
then the scientists
then the scientists
decid the science positions are more
decid the science positions are more
prestigious than the engineering
prestigious than the engineering
positions it's like what are you guys

doing
my favorite thing is now because I'm the
my favorite thing is now because I'm the
scientist I get to complain about this
scientist I get to complain about this
and it's not even lame
and it's not even lame
anymore it's like lame when it's like

the engineer complains why the scientist

is so eight
is so eight
19 or was it here 15 - 14 = 1 right 20 -
19 or was it here 15 - 14 = 1 right 20 -
19 is also equal to one but going from
19 is also equal to one but going from
19 to 20 is you're solving the task and
19 to 20 is you're solving the task and
going from 15 to 14 is a very small
going from 15 to 14 is a very small
Improvement and the same exact thing
Improvement and the same exact thing
happens with percentile data right going
happens with percentile data right going
from 0.9 to 0.999 is huge going from
from 0.9 to 0.999 is huge going from
like 08 to 0.9 is not as huge
for
for
e e
uh well that's because Claude is very
stupid oh did you see there was a
stupid oh did you see there was a
hilarious thing in one of the uh the
hilarious thing in one of the uh the
Twitter chats where
like somebody put in the uh the US
like somebody put in the uh the US
tariffs plan and Claude like could not
tariffs plan and Claude like could not
fathom how it would even be possible and
fathom how it would even be possible and
was like predicting that you know the US
was like predicting that you know the US
Supply would be replaced by like the
Supply would be replaced by like the
farm supply would be replaced by

crumble and whatever and 24 hours
crumble and whatever and 24 hours
later 24 hours later it's like yeah nope
later 24 hours later it's like yeah nope
that
that
worked oh it's
ridiculous CL is not very
ridiculous CL is not very
smart for
okay so this gives you transforms for
okay so this gives you transforms for
but I need to have like
like
this we
normalize Twitter is not good for you
normalize Twitter is not good for you
it's very bad for

training on puffer code I'm just going
training on puffer code I'm just going
to like find and extract bits of puffer
to like find and extract bits of puffer
code and be like hey see the coding

capabilities got so much better cuz it
capabilities got so much better cuz it
finally trained on some good code you're
welcome for
I think I did this right
activations in
place are you sure that's not for
place are you sure that's not for
inference
I guess you could use it in the roll out
I guess you could use it in the roll out
collection
stage yeah cuz it'll destroy your
stage yeah cuz it'll destroy your
gradients if you use it for training
well you're free to investigate anything
well you're free to investigate anything
but I suggest uh what you do is you know
but I suggest uh what you do is you know
you make a table in science what you do
you make a table in science what you do
is you make a table
is you make a table
of things that are likely to be useful
of things that are likely to be useful
and then you rank them from by How
and then you rank them from by How
likely they are to be useful and how
likely they are to be useful and how
useful they're likely to be
useful they're likely to be
morning and then you do them in
morning and then you do them in
approximately that
order modu what you find
interesting for
redo my web server that's obnoxious
H so it's not
H so it's not
happy it should
happy it should
be oh because I have the wrong Max in
be oh because I have the wrong Max in
there okay so yeah this is what it is
there okay so yeah this is what it is
with a completely screw a Max and then
with a completely screw a Max and then
the max should actually here be
one
1.0 let's try this
oh even
lower oh we'll have to look at this
oh wait we don't want untransformed
oh wait we don't want untransformed
squore me we want a normalized square
yeah we don't want to undo the transform
yeah we don't want to undo the transform
the whole point is to have the
transform okay so this thing doesn't
transform okay so this thing doesn't
work either right here now what about
this invalid value
it's a little
better uh it's breaking because the
better uh it's breaking because the
predicted score is um
mhm yeah it's breaking with the
mhm yeah it's breaking with the
predicted
score CL are a little
score CL are a little
better little better than before
raw scores come
raw scores come
in you get the transform
in you get the transform
scores want five is probably good
the suggestions come in
okay so this is a little better you see
okay so this is a little better you see
we actually have some points out
we actually have some points out
here we don't go out to here
though reason being the predictions are
though reason being the predictions are
all
all
one predictions should not all be
one these should be very nicely
one these should be very nicely
separated in latent space
let me see if I I'm undoing it
wrong and we want to log untransformed
wrong and we want to log untransformed
work me
right e
the
heck it's
weird um a normalized
let's put a break point like here
me double check
me double check
uh some
uh some
messages
messages
oops I love when auntu can't update
oops I love when auntu can't update
itself
normally not that bad to update at least
so I'm good I don't have anything for a
so I'm good I don't have anything for a
few
hours
hours
puff Puffer
okay normalized score
okay normalized score
mean
mean so it's scan carbs today work today
mean so it's scan carbs today work today
various work I'm basically just stealing
various work I'm basically just stealing
time to work on this whenever I can cuz
time to work on this whenever I can cuz
I have a million other projects um that
I have a million other projects um that
need to get done but this one is very
need to get done but this one is very
very very important to RL progress so
very very important to RL progress so
whenever I can I work on this and
whenever I can I work on this and
um I have some robotic stuff that has to
um I have some robotic stuff that has to
get done I got some other client stuff
get done I got some other client stuff
that's got to get done today but uh you
that's got to get done today but uh you
know whenever I can do
know whenever I can do
this I do
this this is like the thing that in my
this this is like the thing that in my
mind at the moment this needs to happen
mind at the moment this needs to happen
so RL moves forward if this does not
so RL moves forward if this does not
happen RL does not move forward period
happen RL does not move forward period
so that's
simple I think in those sorts of terms
simple I think in those sorts of terms
you
know all right so something screwing
know all right so something screwing
here
because what we do transform
scores did I undo it wrong hang on I
scores did I undo it wrong hang on I
think I undid it
wrong you take
wrong you take
unnormalized but this is the transform
unnormalized but this is the transform
right so negative
right so negative
log so you
log so you
dox
dox
right and then this gives you minus
this oh so yeah I'm just
this oh so yeah I'm just
trolling my
bad and then what you have to do is you
bad and then what you have to do is you
do this minus what is
do this minus what is
it -1 +
it -1 +
x and then you
x and then you
multiply Max score
I don't know why it is that the
I don't know why it is that the
autocomplete just breaks sometimes like
autocomplete just breaks sometimes like
it should be completing this right and
it should be completing this right and
it's just not it's like come on I'm
it's just not it's like come on I'm
paying for auto complete you going to
paying for auto complete you going to
make me type
this does it just stop yeah
let me do this before I uh at them on
let me do this before I uh at them on
Twitter already up to
Twitter already up to
date well there now it
works yeah you see how fast it's
works yeah you see how fast it's
supposed to
supposed to
be it's like instant when it
be it's like instant when it
works for
oh wait this is supposed to be in
oh wait this is supposed to be in
transform space isn't it
no no no no something's screwy here let
no no no no something's screwy here let
me see
normalized
course there we
course there we
go uh and you actually got to
go uh and you actually got to
[Music]
[Music]
do man
we're going to start cleaning this up at
we're going to start cleaning this up at
some point very soon here so I stop
some point very soon here so I stop
making these dumb
mistakes for
there we
go that looks way
better and I think I missed a negative
better and I think I missed a negative
sign here
how did I miss a negative
sign it's puffer Li easy to set up in
sign it's puffer Li easy to set up in
Mac it should be and if it isn't I'm
Mac it should be and if it isn't I'm
right here I stream almost all day so if
right here I stream almost all day so if
it isn't you come tell me and I fix
it uh you can't use puffer tank is the
it uh you can't use puffer tank is the
only thing so you can't use our
only thing so you can't use our
container because it's a GPU container
container because it's a GPU container
but you can absolutely just install
but you can absolutely just install
puffer
lib I should make a CPU container at
lib I should make a CPU container at
some point that would be good
hang on oh yeah there's a negative sign
hang on oh yeah there's a negative sign
at the
at the
end right there I missed a
negative will I be able yes you you will
negative will I be able yes you you will
be able to develop some of your own M um
be able to develop some of your own M um
the one thing that I will tell you is
the one thing that I will tell you is
that if you want to write C
that if you want to write C
environments uh Mac as a development
environments uh Mac as a development
environment at least as far as I have
environment at least as far as I have
seen out of the box you're missing some
seen out of the box you're missing some
very useful debugging flags on the
very useful debugging flags on the

um the S the address sanitizer
um the S the address sanitizer
specifically yeah I that doesn't work
specifically yeah I that doesn't work
out of the box just on Mac in general I
out of the box just on Mac in general I
think
think
um it might be worth getting like a CPU
um it might be worth getting like a CPU
container for that uh or like just
container for that uh or like just
sshing to any Linux box but I mean you
sshing to any Linux box but I mean you
can get by it's just yeah oh they work
can get by it's just yeah oh they work
with playing 18 perfect then just use
with playing 18 perfect then just use
playing 18 and ignore
playing 18 and ignore
me good
me good
job
see that's why I
see that's why I
stream I get people answering stuff for
stream I get people answering stuff for
me it's great
should add that to the
should add that to the

annoying ones
this is

logging of rewards are you free to help
logging of rewards are you free to help
with this yes and in fact I have code
with this yes and in fact I have code
that you can just copy paste directly in
that you can just copy paste directly in
that will log everything the exact way
that will log everything the exact way
that you should be logging
that you should be logging
it it is in every single
it it is in every single
environment uh I will give you the
environment uh I will give you the
latest version that I stuck
latest version that I stuck
into the late the last environment that
into the late the last environment that
I
I
wrote offer
R.H all right you see all this log code
R.H all right you see all this log code
right here there's like I don't know 50
right here there's like I don't know 50
lines of log code just use
lines of log code just use
this copy paste
this copy paste
in and then you uh if you look in the
in and then you uh if you look in the
scon you'll see how you aggregate logs
scon you'll see how you aggregate logs
across all your different
across all your different
environments and if that's not clear
environments and if that's not clear
enough then yes I can look at code
enough then yes I can look at code
directly
Also let's see did we get anything from
um want to see if I got
um want to see if I got
any oh
any oh
yeah at this did anybody actually go
yeah at this did anybody actually go
Star
it why is this thing not
load I think we got a few
every so often you got to do the star
promo invalid and log
promo invalid and log
ah so how's there an invalid and log
ah so how's there an invalid and log
here anything think
oh wait log of zero is
one then what was I afraa of
one then what was I afraa of
here is this plus
apps I think it a plus apps isn't
it
it
mm so that's got to be minus Epsilon
solid
these look way
better 998 score 998
it's overconfident in a couple
places why is it let the predicted score
places why is it let the predicted score
get up that high
ideally it should get
clipped but I think this is way better
clipped but I think this is way better
already
let's
see hey look at that so we've
see hey look at that so we've
got
got
603s still doesn't go that far
603s still doesn't go that far
out look at this curve though look how
out look at this curve though look how
nicely it filled this in holy look at
nicely it filled this in holy look at
this
this
where's
this look at this right here you see
this look at this right here you see
this perfect
fill that's a perfect parito front right
fill that's a perfect parito front right
there
setup docs puffer
doai all our
stuff single page super
easy yeah this synthetic test
easy yeah this synthetic test
man but we're we're looking at different
man but we're we're looking at different
common data distributions and making
common data distributions and making
sure that it can actually work because
sure that it can actually work because
here's the thing base carbs horribly
here's the thing base carbs horribly
fails the synthetic test as do most
fails the synthetic test as do most
other
other
algorithms so if it can't freaking
algorithms so if it can't freaking
figure it out in the case where it has
figure it out in the case where it has
perfect data and a very good model then
perfect data and a very good model then
what's it going to do
i' like to rescale the percentile test
i' like to rescale the percentile test
just a little bit
here need to be just a little shallower
plus wait
score one plus how's this
work how the heck does this percentile
work how the heck does this percentile
task work am I dumb
okay so this is 0 to
one oh I see
let me see how this
looks that it's just there are some
looks that it's just there are some
optimal hyper prams they're not
optimal hyper prams they're not
randomized and I'm fitting it to a curve
randomized and I'm fitting it to a curve
so I have like a uh there's like a
so I have like a uh there's like a
linear one a log one and a percentile
linear one a log one and a percentile
one this is strictly to test out um the
one this is strictly to test out um the
interaction of various terms in the
interaction of various terms in the
objective
function there we go that's way more
function there we go that's way more
reasonable
and then what's Happening Here is it's
and then what's Happening Here is it's
not getting
not getting
perfect even at high cost because the
perfect even at high cost because the
model
model
is oh no this one's decent hold
is oh no this one's decent hold
on plus 30
yeah okay look at that that's there
yeah okay look at that that's there
we're
good okay so I rescaled it just so it
good okay so I rescaled it just so it
wouldn't all Bunch up here so much um
wouldn't all Bunch up here so much um
it's still a good test
right I might have gone a little too
right I might have gone a little too
heavy on
heavy on
it we do cost over 10
it we do cost over 10
instead that cuz I want to see that it
instead that cuz I want to see that it
can like fill in this steep Reg in
here so I mean but this is still pretty
here so I mean but this is still pretty
good here
good here
like here's all the random data and you
like here's all the random data and you
see that it actually it filled in mostly
see that it actually it filled in mostly
what we would
want so it filled in right here and it
want so it filled in right here and it
filled in even over here these points
I especially like how it's got like this
I especially like how it's got like this
dense coverage of the elbow
here and there's there are a couple
here and there's there are a couple
points like down here and stuff as well
points like down here and stuff as well
so like it is actually going to cover
so like it is actually going to cover
the lower regions but yeah yeah this is
good and if we make the task a little
good and if we make the task a little
more aggressively uh cut
off actually works
better I guess it makes sense they just
better I guess it makes sense they just
didn't have support before and here I
didn't have support before and here I
see that there are a couple higher
see that there are a couple higher
samples okay
see so we did this we did this and now
see so we did this we did this and now
we do
we do
whoops we do
this oh
yeah look at that
check the logging against pong would you
check the logging against pong would you
mind taking a look
mind taking a look
y uh let me know what is wrong with it
y uh let me know what is wrong with it
and I assume the changes are pushed to
and I assume the changes are pushed to
the same place as
the same place as
before and go find
it looking where' It
it looking where' It
Go was in gen chat logging perfect
yeah you just paste the logging
in
in
R
R
reset step
MH looks fine so
MH looks fine so
far is it not working for
far is it not working for
you you got log buffer added
you you got log buffer added
in here's your log
in here's your log
buffer there
yeah so I mean that all looks
yeah so I mean that all looks
fine um is something not working
back go
score and reward are always the
score and reward are always the
same and the values keep
same and the values keep
disappearing well that's log frequency
disappearing well that's log frequency
values disappearing is just they're not
values disappearing is just they're not
getting logged frequently enough most
getting logged frequently enough most
likely uh but which would be very weird
likely uh but which would be very weird
with a report interval of one but if you
with a report interval of one but if you
have a very small batch size that's
have a very small batch size that's
still
still
possible and like you have config any
h no you have a reasonable batch I don't
h no you have a reasonable batch I don't
know where you got these parameters from
know where you got these parameters from
these are moderately unhinged
these are moderately unhinged
parameters um the 4 d96 mini batch is
parameters um the 4 d96 mini batch is
Tiny compared to the batch size in
Tiny compared to the batch size in
particular uh let me see science
have you rendered
it is there a
it is there a
render oh you guys didn't add a
render oh you guys didn't add a
renderer you should add a renderer it
renderer you should add a renderer it
won't be very much code um because
won't be very much code um because
usually my debugging routine for this
usually my debugging routine for this
stuff is like there's a c build where
stuff is like there's a c build where
you just build it and see right so it's
you just build it and see right so it's
a standalone and then I just will watch
a standalone and then I just will watch
what the agent is doing and I'll print
what the agent is doing and I'll print
out the rewards it's doing stuff and see
out the rewards it's doing stuff and see
if it's
if it's
correct so I would add like a little
renderer it's just like a point in 3D
renderer it's just like a point in 3D
space
right mm and
any that's probably confusing
any that's probably confusing
huh all right because you're using the
huh all right because you're using the
ocean you're using ocean you have a
ocean you're using ocean you have a
native environment uh this is when you
native environment uh this is when you
make your environment class right your
make your environment class right your
like drone end in internally it's going
like drone end in internally it's going
to have
to have
1,24 different
1,24 different
environments uh regardless of whether
environments uh regardless of whether
you're using Ocean or you're using like
you're using Ocean or you're using like
Atari that doesn't have the ability to
Atari that doesn't have the ability to
do this the number of environments here
do this the number of environments here
is the number of these whole things that
is the number of these whole things that
it's going to spawn so if you set this
it's going to spawn so if you set this
to two now you have 20 48
to two now you have 20 48
environments and the cool thing is
environments and the cool thing is
technically like let's say that your m
technically like let's say that your m
is fast but not quite fast enough you
is fast but not quite fast enough you
can set this to two you can keep this at
can set this to two you can keep this at
one and then it's asynchronous so it
one and then it's asynchronous so it
actually will trade off between blocks
actually will trade off between blocks
of 1040 ,24
environments but I'd add a basic little
environments but I'd add a basic little
render dis Spenser
render dis Spenser
[Music]
around let me link you his
thing he's he has some example code
let me find an older version before he
let me find an older version before he
made all these changes for you
okay here is your
okay here is your
link it's in the Discord uh that gives
link it's in the Discord uh that gives
you a very very basic example on 3D
you a very very basic example on 3D
rendering you literally just need like
rendering you literally just need like
an empty
an empty
scene with you know a sphere for your
scene with you know a sphere for your
drone and if there objectives or places
drone and if there objectives or places
that it's going to go to put a sphere
that it's going to go to put a sphere
over there as well and you'll be able to
over there as well and you'll be able to
see what's going on there you go
so this thing here
speeding up the
ball that would be an environment
config that would change the way the
config that would change the way the
game plays
okay
okay
171 so this point yeah right here this
171 so this point yeah right here this
is the best
point and this gets high
rating it's over predicting a little
bit should cap it at
bit should cap it at
least does that even
least does that even
help maybe helps a little bit
I guess it is factored into Epsilon with
I guess it is factored into Epsilon with
the
Epsilon Transformers are pretty
good Transformers are pretty
good Transformers are pretty
good I mean there's still a lot to do
here try this on log real quick
not 200 right
hang
on log
2.3 for
it does somewhat bother me that it's
it does somewhat bother me that it's
chosen not to fill out this area but the
chosen not to fill out this area but the
thing is I think that this is so densely
thing is I think that this is so densely
Filled from the initial Point estimates
Filled from the initial Point estimates
that this should be fine and I saw it
that this should be fine and I saw it
fill this point in uh this portion in
before so I think it's probably fine and
before so I think it's probably fine and
actually these points here are from I
actually these points here are from I
think these points here are from uh the
think these points here are from uh the
algorithm right yeah yeah these points
algorithm right yeah yeah these points
here as well so it is doing
here as well so it is doing
it okay so this is very good there's
it okay so this is very good there's
even one over
here
nams
nams oh I think you have to go you have
nams oh I think you have to go you have
to overestimate not underestimate that's
to overestimate not underestimate that's
why if you're going to
why if you're going to
estimate it again
the next thing captain on this is going
the next thing captain on this is going
to be to figure out
to be to figure out
um why the variance of the predictions
um why the variance of the predictions
is significantly overestimating the
is significantly overestimating the
confidence of these models like these
confidence of these models like these
models are way too confident even when
models are way too confident even when
they're very wrong and then uh
they're very wrong and then uh
incorporating conservative bounds
because basically I have it here this
because basically I have it here this
just works when there's no noise and um
just works when there's no noise and um
you have a good gussian process model of
you have a good gussian process model of
Cl for or at least a pretty good
Cl for or at least a pretty good
one so we have to figure out
one so we have to figure out
why uh why these are so overly
confident e
hey that's pretty
hey that's pretty
nice introduce some noise
but the thing is it's wrong
but the thing is it's wrong
so
so
yeah this pretty good though look at
this this is
solid let's see if linear screws it up
solid let's see if linear screws it up
now because of the transform that we
now because of the transform that we
applied
I think this is a good Transformer I
I think this is a good Transformer I
think we finally found the good
transform
e e
okay this is
okay this is
suspicious I think we broke linear
hang on I think we broke the easy test
hang on I think we broke the easy test
by solving the hard
test don't you love it when you do that
test don't you love it when you do that
now you have the harder
now you have the harder
one yeah freaking
thing
thing
well and not terrible to be
honest it's actually come to think of it
honest it's actually come to think of it
this is not a bad outcome
because hold on maybe this is a feature
because hold on maybe this is a feature
not a
not a
bug all right maybe this is a feature
bug all right maybe this is a feature
not a
bug can we sell this as a
feature I think we canell this is a
feature I think we canell this is a
feature so hear me out all right you
feature so hear me out all right you
almost never see this
almost never see this
curve um in reinforcement learning like
ever the only time you see this curve is
ever the only time you see this curve is
basically when you like you learn a
basically when you like you learn a
perfect policy or whatever and you just
perfect policy or whatever and you just
have to run it for longer uh in order to
have to run it for longer uh in order to
like get the higher and higher
like get the higher and higher
score and maybe you make very small
score and maybe you make very small
refinements along the way I've only ever
refinements along the way I've only ever
seen this in
seen this in
Enduro now if that is the
Enduro now if that is the
case then there's absolutely no reason
case then there's absolutely no reason
to explore the lower cost hyper pram
to explore the lower cost hyper pram
space here as
space here as
much in fact the only reason to explore
much in fact the only reason to explore
it is if your model is not
it is if your model is not
confident in its predictions so you use
confident in its predictions so you use
it to bootstrap the uh the confidence
it to bootstrap the uh the confidence
up so uh and then in reality here this
up so uh and then in reality here this
cost this Max this score what would this
be how would you set a Max score on
be how would you set a Max score on
something like
that we're probably going to have to
that we're probably going to have to
come up with something where like if you
come up with something where like if you
don't give it a Max score we come up
don't give it a Max score we come up
with
one maybe it's double your current Max
I mean this isn't even bad like you fill
I mean this isn't even bad like you fill
out some points it misses a couple but
out some points it misses a couple but
this is a model quality problem so we'll
this is a model quality problem so we'll
handle that
handle that
separately it's generally pretty
separately it's generally pretty
good did it have any really bad misses
here 140 at
125 wait how' it do that
that shouldn't be possible
right we log
right we log
him untransformed
oh no no we're good we're good that's
oh no no we're good we're good that's
possible yeah yeah because look the
possible yeah yeah because look the
prediction is just wrong by a bit see we
prediction is just wrong by a bit see we
actually it's cost 120 and we only get
actually it's cost 120 and we only get
119 was fine this is actually even a
119 was fine this is actually even a
good this is actually even a a good
good this is actually even a a good
point this doesn't miss too bad so none
point this doesn't miss too bad so none
of these are really bad misses some of
of these are really bad misses some of
them off by a bit but none of them are
them off by a bit but none of them are
like really bad
like really bad
misses it's about like this distance
misses it's about like this distance
it's fine
it's fine
all right um nearby distant rating mean
all right um nearby distant rating mean
so rating is the overall score where
so rating is the overall score where
highest rating is the one that gets
highest rating is the one that gets
picked to be sampled and um the nearby
picked to be sampled and um the nearby
distance we're evaluating distance to
distance we're evaluating distance to
nearest Paro point and using that as
nearest Paro point and using that as
part of our uh our search
criteria I happy with this
so we fixed uh we have fixed output
so we fixed uh we have fixed output
scaling
now I think we just look at model
now I think we just look at model
variants model variants will be the next
variants model variants will be the next
topic but I'm going to go get breakfast
topic but I'm going to go get breakfast
go get breakfast go for a run do some
go get breakfast go for a run do some
stuff got a meeting and then I will be
stuff got a meeting and then I will be
uh back in a bit
