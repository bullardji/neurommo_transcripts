Oops.
Um, E3B really didn't do anything at
all. Look at that.
That's moderately
disappointing. Let me just add the
disappointing. Let me just add the
uh creator of that
algorithm. I think I can just put the
algorithm. I think I can just put the

What's the time step axis on this
mil. So like 10 bill
Oh, cool. That made us a

probably box
2D you'd have to do the math

work, but I think these ones
did. Yeah, that's pretty
cool. Yeah, that's very cool.
cool. Yeah, that's very cool.
So,
okay. It's not this

Right.
Right.
That means it's doing
something.
So, it does best at

weird. Does significantly worse at

Loch.
Yeah, the loss is very very

low. Just a little
odd. Okay.

Um, it's kind of funny that we have this

It's still going up as

uh you know, maybe we get something with

Maybe there's something to

corpse. It actually set this to zero,
corpse. It actually set this to zero,
which is
interesting. This is negative
interesting. This is negative

Just copy
this. Let
it. So, what do we have here? We've got
it. So, what do we have here? We've got
a batch size
131. This BPT horizon went up to
131. This BPT horizon went up to
32. It's consistent with a lot of what

we've seen
we've seen
lately. Clip

co. Uh oh, that's a little awkward that
co. Uh oh, that's a little awkward that
we still have that in there.
But let's just
do it's interesting that the loss
do it's interesting that the loss

high and this as
high and this as
well.

Okay. Entropy

Interesting. Learning rate is actually

Grad Norm is getting

This algorithm actually does

Oh, you also need this.
1.3 ml
1.3 ml

but it's nowhere near the original. The
but it's nowhere near the original. The
original is
original is
like right
Yeah, up to
Yeah, up to
100. So, let's see if we figure out
100. So, let's see if we figure out
maybe I missed some hypers.
That looks
fine. It does look
fine. It does look
fine. Maybe I missed something in
fine. Maybe I missed something in
training.
Ah, right
here. Interesting. That makes such a

huge difference.
Let's see if it does reproduce now.
Oh
yeah, look at that.
Freaking 100

34.
Oh yeah, right here. That's hardcoded.
Oh yeah, right here. That's hardcoded.
It's fine.
I mean, that looks really damn good.
Holy, this one just
Holy, this one just
like perfectly pathed and saved
itself. That's cool.
That's
awesome. Let me see if I can even make
awesome. Let me see if I can even make
it better.
I mean, that's like Yeah, that's
impressive. Let me crank up total time
impressive. Let me crank up total time
steps for a second.
That's about
That does look Yeah, it's actually
That does look Yeah, it's actually
pretty hard to train a good snake model
pretty hard to train a good snake model
because you get a directional bias in a
because you get a directional bias in a
lot of the rugs. It's very difficult to
lot of the rugs. It's very difficult to
get a run in which um you don't end up
get a run in which um you don't end up
with like all the snakes on one side of
with like all the snakes on one side of
the
the

map. So I imagine that's probably what
the
the
um what the archive is doing in this
um what the archive is doing in this
case.
What's the
What's the
TLDDR? You uh you add a per episode one
TLDDR? You uh you add a per episode one
hot vector.
hot vector.
That's like in this case it's literally
That's like in this case it's literally
just adding 01 or 10 O and then you're
just adding 01 or 10 O and then you're
training a discriminator on that uh that
training a discriminator on that uh that
has to recognize what that initial one
has to recognize what that initial one
half vector is. So essentially you're
half vector is. So essentially you're
adding something to the odds and then
adding something to the odds and then
the agent has to behave in a way such
the agent has to behave in a way such
that you can tell which policy it came
from. Okay. So this doesn't do any
from. Okay. So this doesn't do any
better than the original. Though it is
better than the original. Though it is
nice and stable which is cool to see. It
nice and stable which is cool to see. It
is actually like a stable
is actually like a stable
100. Maybe it's a little better
actually. It might be a little
actually. It might be a little
better. Yeah, I hear a
better. Yeah, I hear a
bot. I train the bots in this
channel. That's freaking cool.
It's funny though that the max archive
It's funny though that the max archive
size is
two. What if I do four?
It's also funny that this one run is
It's also funny that this one run is
like so much better than the other
ones. Max score for this. I have no
ones. Max score for this. I have no
idea. It just depends how tightly the
idea. It just depends how tightly the
snakes are packed together.
Yeah, it's funny. This point's way up
here. I mean, to be fair, a lot of the
here. I mean, to be fair, a lot of the
others are still at like 90 plus.
Yeah, it only gets to 70 if you give it
Yeah, it only gets to 70 if you give it
up an archive size of
up an archive size of
four. That's funny.
Okay, let's see if we can actually see
Okay, let's see if we can actually see
what the different policies do.
Okay, so we have these
guys. Even these ones seem evenly
guys. Even these ones seem evenly
distributed though.
These ones seem more directionally
These ones seem more directionally
biased.
Yeah, they're getting stuck a little in
Yeah, they're getting stuck a little in
the bottom corner though. They don't
the bottom corner though. They don't
just run into the wall.
Okay. I mean, this is
Okay. I mean, this is
interesting. Does it break it completely
interesting. Does it break it completely
if you zero this? Hang on. Let me just
if you zero this? Hang on. Let me just
do this.
Don't even break
it.
it.
Funny. Very funny.
doesn't look like it does. At least I
doesn't look like it does. At least I
can't see any visual distinction between
can't see any visual distinction between
them. We'd have to do like a proper
them. We'd have to do like a proper
eval.
eval.
Um, but I definitely have seen, you
Um, but I definitely have seen, you
know, on some of the lower quality
know, on some of the lower quality
models like that. Um, when I was testing
models like that. Um, when I was testing
this yesterday, I did it with an archive
this yesterday, I did it with an archive
size of four or eight or whatever, and
size of four or eight or whatever, and
you could see that they would go in
you could see that they would go in
different directions based on this
different directions based on this
vector.
It's a slightly fiddly method,
but yeah, it's pretty cheap. It's a
but yeah, it's pretty cheap. It's a
little annoying to add because you have
little annoying to add because you have
to like inject stuff into the OB space
to like inject stuff into the OB space
and there's an extra loss to optimize
and there's an extra loss to optimize
and such, but it's pretty
and such, but it's pretty
decentish. I think really what we need
decentish. I think really what we need
to do though is um we need M's like
to do though is um we need M's like
Impulse Wars and like Neuralarmm MMO and
Impulse Wars and like Neuralarmm MMO and
MOA and we need to have
MOA and we need to have
uh we really need to have it to the
uh we really need to have it to the
point where we're training and
point where we're training and
evaluating on much more complex
evaluating on much more complex
ends and yeah we need just there's you
ends and yeah we need just there's you
know we need some help on the science
know we need some help on the science
side for that honestly. So, I'm very
side for that honestly. So, I'm very
happy to get you involved with that as
happy to get you involved with that as
soon as you have impulse
soon as you have impulse
wars all
wars all
together. And then Spencer after he's
together. And then Spencer after he's
done with GPU drive potentially as
done with GPU drive potentially as
well as there's core RL work to be
well as there's core RL work to be
done.
Okay. I mean, this is some progress.
Okay. I mean, this is some progress.
I'm trying to think now like the highest
I'm trying to think now like the highest
priority
stuff players in a match.
It really depends.
It really depends.
It's
It's
um it's more dependent on like whether
um it's more dependent on like whether
the env has many valid different play
the env has many valid different play
styles.
And there's so much stuff I need to do
And there's so much stuff I need to do
here.
I mean, I could make like there are
I mean, I could make like there are
potentially improvements I could make to
potentially improvements I could make to
it, but I'm not going to know until we
it, but I'm not going to know until we
get more experiments running on
get more experiments running on
different ends. Right? So, this is the
different ends. Right? So, this is the
the important thing is we need to just
the important thing is we need to just
have we need to be running more
have we need to be running more
hyperprogram sweeps and more experiments
hyperprogram sweeps and more experiments
on more of our ends.
on more of our ends.
It's just like the stuff we're doing is
It's just like the stuff we're doing is
good. It just we need more of
it. Frankly, the new algorithm is the

thing that I'm still not sure about the
thing that I'm still not sure about the
um the new advantage function stuff.
um the new advantage function stuff.
Maybe I should look at that real quick.
set all of them
to. There are ones of these that are
to. There are ones of these that are
better. Hang on, let me
better. Hang on, let me
see. Let me sort
see. Let me sort
these. Cost less than 200.
Yeah. So, the best runs don't use any
Yeah. So, the best runs don't use any
form of normalization
here. There are some over here that

Let's look at the best runs. Here's our
Let's look at the best runs. Here's our

This is cost less than

So, this is the burrito front here. Then

Yeah, similar. We have stuff in that

We get

I' yeah I'd say it's somewhat

but it's nowhere near the original. The
original is
original is
like right
Yeah, up to
Yeah, up to
100. So, let's see if we figure out
100. So, let's see if we figure out
maybe I missed some hypers.
That looks
fine. It does look
fine. It does look
fine. Maybe I missed something in
fine. Maybe I missed something in
training.
Ah, right
here. Interesting. That makes such a
here. Interesting. That makes such a
huge difference.
Let's see if it does reproduce now.
Oh
yeah, look at that.
Freaking 100

Uh, well, it's calculated per

34.
Oh yeah, right here. That's hardcoded.
Oh yeah, right here. That's hardcoded.
It's fine.
I mean, that looks really damn good.
Holy, this one just
Holy, this one just
like perfectly pathed and saved
itself. That's cool.
That's
awesome. Let me see if I can even make
awesome. Let me see if I can even make
it better.
I mean, that's like Yeah, that's
impressive. Let me crank up total time
impressive. Let me crank up total time
steps for a second.
That's about
That does look Yeah, it's actually
That does look Yeah, it's actually
pretty hard to train a good snake model
pretty hard to train a good snake model
because you get a directional bias in a
because you get a directional bias in a
lot of the rugs. It's very difficult to
lot of the rugs. It's very difficult to
get a run in which um you don't end up
get a run in which um you don't end up
with like all the snakes on one side of
with like all the snakes on one side of
the
the
map. So I imagine that's probably what
map. So I imagine that's probably what
the
the
um what the archive is doing in this
um what the archive is doing in this
case.
What's the
What's the
TLDDR? You uh you add a per episode one
TLDDR? You uh you add a per episode one
hot vector.
hot vector.
That's like in this case it's literally
That's like in this case it's literally
just adding 01 or 10 O and then you're
just adding 01 or 10 O and then you're
training a discriminator on that uh that
training a discriminator on that uh that
has to recognize what that initial one
has to recognize what that initial one
half vector is. So essentially you're
half vector is. So essentially you're
adding something to the odds and then
adding something to the odds and then
the agent has to behave in a way such
the agent has to behave in a way such
that you can tell which policy it came
from. Okay. So this doesn't do any
from. Okay. So this doesn't do any
better than the original. Though it is
better than the original. Though it is
nice and stable which is cool to see. It
nice and stable which is cool to see. It
is actually like a stable
is actually like a stable
100. Maybe it's a little better
actually. It might be a little
actually. It might be a little
better. Yeah, I hear a
better. Yeah, I hear a
bot. I train the bots in this
channel. That's freaking cool.
It's funny though that the max archive
It's funny though that the max archive
size is
two. What if I do four?
It's also funny that this one run is
It's also funny that this one run is
like so much better than the other
ones. Max score for this. I have no
ones. Max score for this. I have no
idea. It just depends how tightly the
idea. It just depends how tightly the
snakes are packed together.
Yeah, it's funny. This point's way up
here. I mean, to be fair, a lot of the
here. I mean, to be fair, a lot of the
others are still at like 90 plus.
Yeah, it only gets to 70 if you give it
Yeah, it only gets to 70 if you give it
up an archive size of
up an archive size of
four. That's funny.
Okay, let's see if we can actually see
Okay, let's see if we can actually see
what the different policies do.
Okay, so we have these
guys. Even these ones seem evenly
guys. Even these ones seem evenly
distributed though.
These ones seem more directionally
These ones seem more directionally
biased.
Yeah, they're getting stuck a little in
Yeah, they're getting stuck a little in
the bottom corner though. They don't
the bottom corner though. They don't
just run into the wall.
Okay. I mean, this is
Okay. I mean, this is
interesting. Does it break it completely
interesting. Does it break it completely
if you zero this? Hang on. Let me just
if you zero this? Hang on. Let me just
do this.
Don't even break
it.
it.
Funny. Very funny.
doesn't look like it does. At least I
doesn't look like it does. At least I
can't see any visual distinction between
can't see any visual distinction between
them. We'd have to do like a proper
them. We'd have to do like a proper
eval.
eval.
Um, but I definitely have seen, you
Um, but I definitely have seen, you
know, on some of the lower quality
know, on some of the lower quality
models like that. Um, when I was testing
models like that. Um, when I was testing
this yesterday, I did it with an archive
this yesterday, I did it with an archive
size of four or eight or whatever, and
size of four or eight or whatever, and
you could see that they would go in
you could see that they would go in
different directions based on this
different directions based on this
vector.
It's a slightly fiddly method,
but yeah, it's pretty cheap. It's a
but yeah, it's pretty cheap. It's a
little annoying to add because you have
little annoying to add because you have
to like inject stuff into the OB space
to like inject stuff into the OB space
and there's an extra loss to optimize
and there's an extra loss to optimize
and such, but it's pretty
and such, but it's pretty
decentish. I think really what we need
decentish. I think really what we need
to do though is um we need M's like
to do though is um we need M's like
Impulse Wars and like Neuralarmm MMO and
Impulse Wars and like Neuralarmm MMO and
MOA and we need to have
MOA and we need to have
uh we really need to have it to the
uh we really need to have it to the
point where we're training and
point where we're training and
evaluating on much more complex
evaluating on much more complex
ends and yeah we need just there's you
ends and yeah we need just there's you
know we need some help on the science
know we need some help on the science
side for that honestly. So, I'm very
side for that honestly. So, I'm very
happy to get you involved with that as
happy to get you involved with that as
soon as you have impulse
soon as you have impulse
wars all
wars all
together. And then Spencer after he's
together. And then Spencer after he's
done with GPU drive potentially as
done with GPU drive potentially as
well as there's core RL work to be
well as there's core RL work to be
done.
Okay. I mean, this is some progress.
Okay. I mean, this is some progress.
I'm trying to think now like the highest
I'm trying to think now like the highest
priority
stuff players in a match.
It really depends.
It really depends.
It's
It's
um it's more dependent on like whether
um it's more dependent on like whether
the env has many valid different play
the env has many valid different play
styles.
And there's so much stuff I need to do
And there's so much stuff I need to do
here.
I mean, I could make like there are
I mean, I could make like there are
potentially improvements I could make to
potentially improvements I could make to
it, but I'm not going to know until we
it, but I'm not going to know until we
get more experiments running on
get more experiments running on
different ends. Right? So, this is the
different ends. Right? So, this is the
the important thing is we need to just
the important thing is we need to just
have we need to be running more
have we need to be running more
hyperprogram sweeps and more experiments
hyperprogram sweeps and more experiments
on more of our ends.
on more of our ends.
It's just like the stuff we're doing is
It's just like the stuff we're doing is
good. It just we need more of
it. Frankly, the new algorithm is the
it. Frankly, the new algorithm is the
thing that I'm still not sure about the
thing that I'm still not sure about the
um the new advantage function stuff.
um the new advantage function stuff.
Maybe I should look at that real quick.
set all of them
to. There are ones of these that are
to. There are ones of these that are
better. Hang on, let me
better. Hang on, let me
see. Let me sort
see. Let me sort
these. Cost less than 200.
Yeah. So, the best runs don't use any
Yeah. So, the best runs don't use any
form of normalization
here. There are some over here that
here. There are some over here that
still
can. Interesting.
Let's look at the best runs. Here's our
Let's look at the best runs. Here's our

for
for
this, which is nowhere near as good as
Where's our fast one?
Oh, no. Good with this one.
This
This

here. So
here. So
here we can do
here we can do
This is cost less than
200. See what this comes up with. Okay.
200. See what this comes up with. Okay.
So, this is the burrito front here. Then
So, this is the burrito front here. Then
here we'll do cost less than 100.
Oops. Is this the right

Okay. See this is 100 here. This one is
Okay. See this is 100 here. This one is
I say 150. Okay. No, this is correct.
I say 150. Okay. No, this is correct.
I'd say
I'd say
so
sample. What do we get for learning
sample. What do we get for learning
rate? Like O5.
Yeah, similar. We have stuff in that
Yeah, similar. We have stuff in that
range.
range.
O5. Okay. And then we get like gamma and
O5. Okay. And then we get like gamma and
lambda for this one.
We get
entropy. Where's
entropy? Yeah, entropy is pretty
entropy? Yeah, entropy is pretty
flexible. We have it lower over here.
Hang on. What
Hang on. What
is Why do we have this as a a thing?
Now this has P30

Okay. Well, that's concerning.
Okay. Well, that's concerning.
Oh,

errors working. Start sweeping. Uh it's
errors working. Start sweeping. Uh it's
somewhat stable for sure.
I' yeah I'd say it's somewhat
I' yeah I'd say it's somewhat
stable like if you try to use our new

wondering what's different and it

literally seems

figured out a better batch size, right?
This one just figured out how to do 8192
This one just figured out how to do 8192
mini back and then this one didn't.
Right.
Right.
Yeah. Oh no, it has the same mini batch.
Yeah. Oh no, it has the same mini batch.
Hang on. Then what happened?
800k 2

130k update
130k update
epox 2k maybe.
Yeah, no 2Ks.
Okay, I think that if anything, the uh

Yeah. I mean, on one hand, I don't want
Yeah. I mean, on one hand, I don't want
you to just be working on rendering
you to just be working on rendering

probably cool stuff for you to learn.
