super crashy, we'll just I'll just do
super crashy, we'll just I'll just do
stuff off stream. But uh I figured it

Hello, Alexand Alexander.
I've increased squared size to 22 and
I've increased squared size to 22 and
agent is not learning.
agent is not learning.
What do you think they're missing?
What do you think they're missing?
Well, it's just really sparse.
Well, it's just really sparse.
So like you'd have to tune you'd have to
So like you'd have to tune you'd have to
tune other things for that. Basically
you're going to need you actually you've
you're going to need you actually you've
taken a simple environment and you've
taken a simple environment and you've
actually made it hard when you do that
because you basically you have to luck
because you basically you have to luck
into the sequence of 40 moves that gets
into the sequence of 40 moves that gets
you to the target randomly.
you to the target randomly.
Yeah. But the thing is you have to this
Yeah. But the thing is you have to this
is part of the article that you should
is part of the article that you should
read, right? So what happens when you
read, right? So what happens when you
increase increase size? All right, if
increase increase size? All right, if
you look at the problem, it's not any
you look at the problem, it's not any
harder for you. You already know how to
harder for you. You already know how to
solve it. When you're training from
solve it. When you're training from
scratch, you make the problem
scratch, you make the problem
exponentially harder because now the
exponentially harder because now the
agent has to luck into finding the
agent has to luck into finding the
target and it has to luck into finding
target and it has to luck into finding
the target a few times and then it has
the target a few times and then it has
to credit assign back 40 steps. So it's
to credit assign back 40 steps. So it's
very easy to build things that look easy
very easy to build things that look easy
because of your intuition. But what you
because of your intuition. But what you
have to do is you have to think about
have to do is you have to think about
starting from scratch as a naive
starting from scratch as a naive
exploration problem. How hard is this?
exploration problem. How hard is this?
That's the trick.
That's part I think I mentioned stuff
That's part I think I mentioned stuff
like this in my No, I actually this is
like this in my No, I actually this is
in like all my best advice in one place.
in like all my best advice in one place.
I gave you that information in that
I gave you that information in that
section.
Pretty much everything that I can tell
Pretty much everything that I can tell
you is going to be in that guide in some
you is going to be in that guide in some
form. So, what I I think I'm going to do
form. So, what I I think I'm going to do
from now on is I'm going to answer all
from now on is I'm going to answer all
these questions, but I'm also going to
these questions, but I'm also going to
point people to where it is in the guide
point people to where it is in the guide
because it's like it's the type of thing
because it's like it's the type of thing
where all the information is there, but
where all the information is there, but
you're not going to draw the
you're not going to draw the

I'm trying to remember where the heck I

It's too fun. I don't want to rush too
It's too fun. I don't want to rush too

So, here's the thing.
So, here's the thing.
Don't, if you're starting out, don't use
Don't, if you're starting out, don't use
one of the slow environments to learn.
Like, don't use one of the very slow
Like, don't use one of the very slow
environments when you're learning cuz
environments when you're learning cuz
it's just going to it's going to make
it's just going to it's going to make
the process of doing everything really
the process of doing everything really
painful.

Like, use Snake.

Sound is rippling.

Well, it's not going to be as high
Well, it's not going to be as high

quality as my other setup. I have a $200
audio setup here. I have a $1,000 audio
audio setup here. I have a $1,000 audio
setup there.
I'm also streaming this from my bedroom
I'm also streaming this from my bedroom
with like a green screen, so it's it's a
with like a green screen, so it's it's a
small echoey room. If anybody has better
small echoey room. If anybody has better
compressor settings, like go for it. But
I can at least maybe move the mic a
I can at least maybe move the mic a
little closer. It'll be in the shot

here. We'll move the puffer. We'll move
here. We'll move the puffer. We'll move
the uh the puffer. He likes to cover the

And then I can probably mic it down just
And then I can probably mic it down just
a little bit.
Okay. Yeah, I remember where we were
Okay. Yeah, I remember where we were
now.
I kind of got off track
I kind of got off track
because I had I had like four or five
because I had I had like four or five
meetings yesterday as well as like all
meetings yesterday as well as like all
the release stuff with the article. So,
the release stuff with the article. So,
I sort of forgot what I was building
I sort of forgot what I was building
with this, but um we were working on
with this, but um we were working on
getting the two different drone sims,
getting the two different drone sims,
the multi- aents forming sim and the

without making a mess out of everything

in the process. And uh I think I had

just about gotten that to run.
Hopefully this doesn't lag or crash
Hopefully this doesn't lag or crash
though. We'll see.
I tried to sweep

If you're competent at low-level

the first several sections of my guide
the first several sections of my guide
in two weeks, and you will be able to

like you'll be able to build something
like you'll be able to build something
on the level of an arcade game and get

it to train with RL in two weeks.
Okay. So, this lags the hell out of

do is we're going to put this on I'm

some good hyperparams. If you're going
some good hyperparams. If you're going
to scale the environment that up, you're
to scale the environment that up, you're
probably going to have to increase the

I don't exactly remember, but I think I

You've made it non-trivial.

It's very easy to do things like this.

I think that if you have the batch size

swept, then it does get swept. Um,
I also don't remember how I did the OB

because it's like kind of okay for heavy

but that doesn't seem to be the case

somehow. Now the drones are just like
somehow. Now the drones are just like
super zippy fast.
I don't think it would make any sense
I don't think it would make any sense
for this to be a learning bug, right?
I mean, the render is not great, but

that won't affect anything.

I mean, that takes kind of like

Okay. So I mean we know that I had I had

Really? The DT also doesn't help, huh?
Maybe this is
Try some stuff here.
Could just be some SIM screw-ups because

I don't see anything else wrong with the

Yeah, if we probably just did something
Yeah, if we probably just did something
dumb.
02.
Now this is not training at all.
Weird.
Wouldn't train at all with
Maybe the racing one's too much.
We can try it like this.
That would make them zippy, wouldn't it?
could very well just be this.
Yeah, this is learning more.
weird if out of bounds gets stuck at 7.
weird if out of bounds gets stuck at 7.
It shouldn't.
No, that's fine. Gamma's fine.
No, that's fine. Gamma's fine.
Weird. See it back.
It's interesting that this doesn't learn
It's interesting that this doesn't learn
to not o be
dt this way.
We did train this before.
It's totally screwing up. Yeah.
Oh, did my um hang on. Did my other fix
Oh, did my um hang on. Did my other fix
get tapped or no?
get tapped or no?
Ah, hang on. Maybe it's a combination of
Ah, hang on. Maybe it's a combination of
these.
these.
Yeah, that can't learn. We're going to
Yeah, that can't learn. We're going to
try this.
try this.
Try this one.
Yeah. Okay,
Yeah. Okay,
that's a big difference.
Now question is, does Perf actually fix
Now question is, does Perf actually fix
as well?
Or is it going to hover at the same
Or is it going to hover at the same
area of point like below seven? No, it
area of point like below seven? No, it
looks like it solves.

Well, this was a really dumb way to

spend an afternoon if this was the bug.
spend an afternoon if this was the bug.
I guess it was a combination of two

things which makes sense that it was

layered like that.
Two very like simple oversightes though

ultimately.
ultimately.
Yeah, this solves
Okay. So, uh, the next thing is going to
Okay. So, uh, the next thing is going to
be
to do the randomized one.
I'm just going to make sure today really
I'm just going to make sure today really
all I want to do is make sure that we
all I want to do is make sure that we
have a decent starting point for this
have a decent starting point for this
stuff and then uh I can pick this up
stuff and then uh I can pick this up
know early next week
know early next week
as soon as I know we have a decent
as soon as I know we have a decent

We'll show a few cool demos though
We'll show a few cool demos though
before I finish uh with work today
before I finish uh with work today
because I think that this will look
because I think that this will look
pretty cool. I don't know how it's going
pretty cool. I don't know how it's going
to do with the racing task cuz it's kind
to do with the racing task cuz it's kind
of like a weird thing to add into the
of like a weird thing to add into the
same space, but um
same space, but um
we'll see how that goes.
That shouldn't be very hard.
That shouldn't be very hard.
Actually,
you know what we're going to do? We're
you know what we're going to do? We're
going to do
That'll give it more fine grain control.
Yeah, that'll give it more fine grain
Yeah, that'll give it more fine grain
control because now it can see both

where the target is like the direction,

see a more fine grained version of that.
see a more fine grained version of that.

Interesting.
Okay. So, this does not train on all
Okay. So, this does not train on all
tasks.
Let's assume that it's the racing task
Let's assume that it's the racing task
breaking stuff
breaking stuff
and let's see what this does.
Sure.
I didn't undo this other change.
This should learn to not obey.
There we go.
So, at least initially, we'll see if
So, at least initially, we'll see if
it's stable, but it does learn to not
it's stable, but it does learn to not
OB.
And yeah, that looks like it's doing uh
And yeah, that looks like it's doing uh
that's reasonable stuff
that's reasonable stuff
again, at least initially. We might have
again, at least initially. We might have
to reweep, we might have to do other
to reweep, we might have to do other
things, but
things, but
that was good. Perf
and I know 08 is the perf that you want.
and I know 08 is the perf that you want.
So I can just do
this is fine.
this is fine.
and major. Welcome.
Okay. So, this gets like 08
82 or whatever
82 or whatever
like short order.
like short order.
Try with randomizing the parameters a
Try with randomizing the parameters a
little bit
and then we'll do the racing one next.
What I'll do here is I'll try to uh I'm
What I'll do here is I'll try to uh I'm
going to try to finish stuff up early
going to try to finish stuff up early
today because I really got to go get
today because I really got to go get
myself some exercise.
myself some exercise.
also have to answer some emails,
but I want to at least get us a very
but I want to at least get us a very
cool drone demo today.
So, this is domain randomized multi
So, this is domain randomized multi
multitask training minus the racing
multitask training minus the racing
task. If this works, we'll just do
task. If this works, we'll just do
standalone racing task
standalone racing task
and we'll figure out anything wrong with
and we'll figure out anything wrong with
that.
Oh, you know what? It tries.
I know exactly what'll be wrong with
I know exactly what'll be wrong with
that to be fair. So, that's not going to
that to be fair. So, that's not going to
be a big deal.
Is the new physics stuff in there? Not
Is the new physics stuff in there? Not
yet. It will be. I'll merge that in
yet. It will be. I'll merge that in
quite soon. Don't worry.
This thing is still going a little bit.
This thing is still going a little bit.
That's crazy.
135k on this.
Is it much better?
The physic the new physics I have not
The physic the new physics I have not
looked at yet.
Oh, these guys are still alive. That's
Oh, these guys are still alive. That's
awesome.
Hey, what if we put robots in pipes and
Hey, what if we put robots in pipes and
like shoot them through uh pipes to
like shoot them through uh pipes to
deliver you stuff? It's funny.
It's like miniature hyperloop for
It's like miniature hyperloop for
delivery robots.
pretty much that. Yeah, major. It's a
pretty much that. Yeah, major. It's a
funny thing. I have no idea if it's
funny thing. I have no idea if it's
practical, but it's cool. All right, so
practical, but it's cool. All right, so
this still pretty well works. Um 2.8 8
this still pretty well works. Um 2.8 8
is about what you'd expect for working
is about what you'd expect for working
on this.
on this.
Next thing, racing task
Okay. So, where's the where are my rings
Okay. So, where's the where are my rings
for this?
Oh yeah. No, this actually works. It's
Oh yeah. No, this actually works. It's
not drawn. This is totally fine.
Motor lag. Did they in the new physics?
Motor lag. Did they in the new physics?
I will check that. That looks cool.
I will check that. That looks cool.
Or sounds cool at least.
weird that it's not learning the uh OB
All right.
Yeah. So, that didn't work at all. Cool.
How is these? I don't understand how
How is these? I don't understand how
this just refuses to cash like literally
this just refuses to cash like literally
anything.
All right.
Okay, so this is the mess that's
Okay, so this is the mess that's
happening here.
Lots of big drones crashing into each
Lots of big drones crashing into each
other because they're too big,
other because they're too big,
I guess.
Let's try uh
Let's try uh
a good thing I rendered that actually
So, I'm seeing if I make smaller drones,
So, I'm seeing if I make smaller drones,
right?
right?
If that just solves it or not.
Doesn't look like it does.
I mean, they're just too big, right?
I mean, they're just too big, right?
Like these things.
Like these things.
I I guess that visually the rendering
I I guess that visually the rendering
isn't quite matched. They're not
isn't quite matched. They're not
actually quite as big as they're shown.
actually quite as big as they're shown.
They're still pretty big. But uh
They're still pretty big. But uh
yeah,
heck, I think the collision checks
heck, I think the collision checks
though are um
though are um
the collision checks don't depend on the
the collision checks don't depend on the
drone size except for the ones with the
drone size except for the ones with the
rings.
rings.
So maybe this is not it.
Okay, let's see what else it could be.
Ah,
Ah,
I see.
No, but if out of bounds,
No, but if out of bounds,
we should still be getting negative out
we should still be getting negative out
of bounds, right?
No collision penalty. Yeah, this is
No collision penalty. Yeah, this is
actually this should be very good.
Can they see the rings?
Yeah, they can see their banks.
Yeah, the rings are big enough. They
Yeah, the rings are big enough. They
should be at least.
Because I have the same thing in drone
Because I have the same thing in drone
race, right?
Yeah, I have the same thing.
Yeah, I have the same thing.
It works here.
Ah, I see the problem.
All the ring checks are going to be
All the ring checks are going to be
wrong.
There we go.
3.2.
3.2.
Yeah, I know. We're kind of slacking,
Yeah, I know. We're kind of slacking,
right?
Not even 4 mil.
Hey, imagine.
Well, this is what I wanted to have. So,
Well, this is what I wanted to have. So,
uh,
why is that be going back up?
why is that be going back up?
I'm just not stable.
This definitely does do something.
This definitely does do something.
I have a question. Yeah, shoot.
Going to do add the domain randomization
Going to do add the domain randomization
back in.
see if that makes it better or worse.
see if that makes it better or worse.
Should make it harder but slightly more
Should make it harder but slightly more
stable. But we'll see if that's the
stable. But we'll see if that's the
case.
Either way, I think this is the last
Either way, I think this is the last
thing I want to do is train this and see
thing I want to do is train this and see
if it uh well, one more thing after

at Nural MMO. Yeah, I don't I've thought
at Nural MMO. Yeah, I don't I've thought
about changing that handle, but I don't
about changing that handle, but I don't
know what I would change it to. Would I
know what I would change it to. Would I
just change it to like my J Suarez 5341?
just change it to like my J Suarez 5341?
I don't know.
I could just do that so I have the same
I could just do that so I have the same

snipe. Do not do that.
snipe. Do not do that.
The reason that you don't do that is
The reason that you don't do that is
because it's like kind of okay for heavy
because it's like kind of okay for heavy
physics. You should probably be doing

something else at that point. But um the
something else at that point. But um the
problem with jacks based environments is
problem with jacks based environments is
that you force yourself to write

just write arbitrary logic in C, not

have to warp your mind into writing

Jacks for environments was a really

Yeah, literally was um doing that first.
Just try the C. It's really really basic

What are the possibilities that like

what's even the error surface of this?

is it not getting clamped or something?

Why are the drones this big though?

Isn't that kind of sketchy?
Hang on.
No.
How's this make any sense?
Okay. Yeah, this is not what it should
Okay. Yeah, this is not what it should

The drones are like bigger than I would

What's up, B?
Are you doing a knit on the end?
It doesn't need to be double knitted.

That's dumb, right?

But then
wait,
this is building.
Yeah, the drones are too big. They're

not supposed to be that big.
Right.
Where's the divisible

Did I get rid of this in the racing end?
Did I get rid of this in the racing end?
Did I just like forget what I was doing?
Hang on.
Okay. Like this looks better,
but I don't have tasks in here, right?
Five

Okay, so I guess there are a few

I'm just going to look for a zero
I'm just going to look for a zero
everywhere in here. It's going to be a

lot of them, but
getting a lot of views on X. So, the
getting a lot of views on X. So, the
annoying thing about X is um you can't

So I was the hypothesis here was that

like I had accidentally not reset

terminals like I maybe I'd only did it

for the first agent because this was
for the first agent because this was
originally a single agent environment

but that doesn't seem to be the case
but that doesn't seem to be the case
somehow. Now the drones are just like
somehow. Now the drones are just like
super zippy fast.
I don't think it would make any sense
I don't think it would make any sense
for this to be a learning bug, right?
I mean, the render is not great, but
I mean, the render is not great, but
that won't affect anything.
This thing maybe
I did I test this with multi hang on.

Super zippy fast might cause it to hit

really surprised if it's a learning

problem. Like, I think that something is

different in the sim because this was a
different in the sim because this was a
big refactor, right? I took two

think something is broken in the

Hang on. So this this should be fine

because I pass a pointer to actions but

So like it can't it can't break because

Super weird.
Let me just double check one more time

I will check that. That looks cool.

How is these? I don't understand how

Okay, let's see what else it could be.
Ah,
Ah,
I see.
No, but if out of bounds,
No, but if out of bounds,
we should still be getting negative out

No collision penalty. Yeah, this is
No collision penalty. Yeah, this is
actually this should be very good.
Can they see the rings?
Yeah, they can see their banks.
Yeah, the rings are big enough. They
Yeah, the rings are big enough. They
should be at least.
Because I have the same thing in drone
Because I have the same thing in drone
race, right?
Yeah, I have the same thing.
Yeah, I have the same thing.
It works here.
Ah, I see the problem.
All the ring checks are going to be

wrong.
There we go.

Yeah, I know. We're kind of slacking,
Yeah, I know. We're kind of slacking,
right?
Not even 4 mil.
Hey, imagine.
Well, this is what I wanted to have. So,
Well, this is what I wanted to have. So,
uh,
why is that be going back up?
why is that be going back up?
I'm just not stable.
This definitely does do something.

I have a question. Yeah, shoot.
Going to do add the domain randomization

Should make it harder but slightly more

stable. But we'll see if that's the
stable. But we'll see if that's the
case.
Either way, I think this is the last

We will see.
It is more stable.

So that's cool to see. 3 mil SPS. No,

It's probably like 1 million. Like 1

He's actually quite smart.
Well, that's not the issue cuz we can

And you actually you'll probably end up

Welcome, Sedarth.
Yes, these guys aren't really doing

Most likely there's just some bugs in

Not a huge deal. We'll be able to fix
