Um, hey, uh, am I audible? Yeah. Hey.
Um, hey, uh, am I audible? Yeah. Hey.
Yeah. So actually uh it's only one
Yeah. So actually uh it's only one
agent. Uh basically uh the problem is
agent. Uh basically uh the problem is
solving EFX allocation. So there are
solving EFX allocation. So there are
multiple agent which need to be
multiple agent which need to be
allocated items and they have utilities
allocated items and they have utilities
like each agent has a utility for an
like each agent has a utility for an
item. So the agent is not like multi
item. So the agent is not like multi
like real multi- agent R. It's just the
like real multi- agent R. It's just the
like the agent is only one. solving for
like the agent is only one. solving for
uh it's solving it's solving basically
uh it's solving it's solving basically
which um agent gets which item so that
which um agent gets which item so that
it's uh so that the allocation is NV3.
it's uh so that the allocation is NV3.
So then is the RL problem
So then is the RL problem
is it like on the allocation or is it
is it like on the allocation or is it
like an action of an agent
like it's on the allocation. So the
like it's on the allocation. So the
problem actually solves for the
problem actually solves for the
allocation. Okay. So then the agent is
allocation. Okay. So then the agent is
not the thing the thing that it's being
not the thing the thing that it's being
assigned to is not the agent. The agent
assigned to is not the agent. The agent
is the uh the allocator.
Uh no actually we allocate we allocate
Uh no actually we allocate we allocate
items to it. Yeah. Then what's the
items to it. Yeah. Then what's the
action space? What how by what mechanism
action space? What how by what mechanism
do you interact with this thing?
do you interact with this thing?
So uh in in one like for like when we

take an action we set the we set the
take an action we set the we set the

and the halt halt flag.
But how how I don't like there are two
But how how I don't like there are two
different problems here right like how
different problems here right like how
is it an allocation problem that's also
is it an allocation problem that's also
a touring machine problem like
a touring machine problem like
I'm confused. Sure.
I'm confused. Sure.
Okay. So, uh, basically what I'm trying
Okay. So, uh, basically what I'm trying
to learn an algorithm that allocates.
to learn an algorithm that allocates.
So,
So,
you're trying to learn an algorithm that
you're trying to learn an algorithm that
allocates.
allocates.
Yeah.
Something's got to happen with the
Something's got to happen with the
action space here because the action
action space here because the action
space is like nuts. Um,
space is like nuts. Um,
like here,
like here,
let's let's do it this way. So the
let's let's do it this way. So the
action space is the tape size plus the
action space is the tape size plus the
max items plus one. What is the action
max items plus one. What is the action
supposed to do? Like how is it supposed
supposed to do? Like how is it supposed
to be interpreted?
to be interpreted?
So uh the action basically what it does
So uh the action basically what it does
is uh at this moment it assigns um uh it
is uh at this moment it assigns um uh it
it assigns the memory. So whatever like
it assigns the memory. So whatever like
uh like if the action space is tape size
uh like if the action space is tape size
plus uh max items plus one the tape size
plus uh max items plus one the tape size
part of it just copies whatever it has
part of it just copies whatever it has
outputed to the memory tape. It just
outputed to the memory tape. It just
updates the tape. I'm I'm planning to
updates the tape. I'm I'm planning to
change that but yeah for for now it
change that but yeah for for now it
updates the tape this memory of the uh
updates the tape this memory of the uh
this the whole tape at once.
this the whole tape at once.
Yeah. And the tape is size 1500 isn't
Yeah. And the tape is size 1500 isn't

it?
Yeah. Okay. So, you've just created
Yeah. Okay. So, you've just created
you've just created an impossible
you've just created an impossible

that and expect it to learn anything.
The search space of that is ridiculous.
The search space of that is ridiculous.
I mean, it's like
I mean, it's like
you're trying to guess a point in 1500
you're trying to guess a point in 1500
dimensional space and then you're

learning that with one bit feedback
learning that with one bit feedback
which is the RL signal.
So like there are many things that you
So like there are many things that you
can do here right like and that's not
can do here right like and that's not
even how like usually a touring machine
even how like usually a touring machine
would work right like usually you have
would work right like usually you have
individual actions that can be taken but
individual actions that can be taken but
set a like setting an element of the
set a like setting an element of the
tape is reasonable for instance um
I think just structurally the end is a
I think just structurally the end is a
bit confused and then as to why it's

slow
Oh,
why is the tape even that big? Like,
why is the tape even that big? Like,
I could get it. Uh, I could get it a

um
like you're trying to zero shot the

Yeah. No, actually it's a multi-step

Okay. So, here it's like quadratic or
Okay. So, here it's like quadratic or
something because that made it 100. It
something because that made it 100. It
must be quadratic because I it just I

reduced by a factor of 10 and it got
reduced by a factor of 10 and it got
100x faster.
100x faster.
So you have what? However you're doing

this has got to be like quadratic in
this has got to be like quadratic in
tape size or agents or something. Um
tape size or agents or something. Um
because that's 9 million steps a second
because that's 9 million steps a second
immediately.
So definitely look at like just the
So definitely look at like just the
complexity of how this thing scales. And
complexity of how this thing scales. And
then I I don't understand how it is that
then I I don't understand how it is that
you have a multi-step touring machine
you have a multi-step touring machine

Right. Actually, I actually thought

Yeah. Yeah. I I I thought about that. Uh
Yeah. Yeah. I I I thought about that. Uh
yeah, I'm just trying things out. Uh uh

I mean uh I can actually still justify

that whatever action it has taken in one

uh, yeah, I would suggest if you're

if you model this thing off of how a

been a few years since I thought about

like move tape, read, write, like that

like increment, decrement by some fixed

I guess. Read and store stuff like Yeah,
I guess. Read and store stuff like Yeah,
you literally end up with like a five or
you literally end up with like a five or
six dimensional discrete action. And

then this thing will run. You can even

have the fullsize tape if you do that.

Uh, and then this thing should run

should be able to do stuff with it.

Yeah. Um, I'll do that. And then like
Yeah. Um, I'll do that. And then like
additionally,

the observation wouldn't be the entire

Okay.
Okay.
Send me a map for GPU drive.
Load that in.
And after that, I think we'll just um
And after that, I think we'll just um
start looking for well, we'll have to

start collecting all of the videos.
figure this out in the meantime.
Yeah, they just freaking broke the

Where do we usually get models?
Bye-bye car.

Thank you, Spencer. Let me get first.
What are these? The We got spheres

I wish I could just get us like a better

Surely there's got to be some like cool

This should be big enough.
3D models are crazy.
Oh, these drones actually they have some

I'll get this on the website and I'll

Where's the like the show lines button,

man?
Oh, this is cool.
Shift.

Cool.
Cool.
Shift like hides everything else.
We not make it hide everything else like

Yeah, but like it it's going to look

really freaking cool if you can see the
really freaking cool if you can see the

Where is it?
Where's the thing that disables drawing

We'll remove the goals, right?
Well, let's just
What the keeps happening to this

Okay, maybe I borked it.
Yeah. No, it's like cuz it collides

instantly or something.
Which cars?
I thought you could switch cars with the

Okay, there we are.
But I'm still not driving it. It's

Okay. What is just chill out and don't

do anything as an action?
All
right, I will let you sort that. Let me
right, I will let you sort that. Let me
just fix this at least so I can get
just fix this at least so I can get
something.
I figure out where it actually like
I figure out where it actually like
stops at drawing
Probably this, right?
Yeah, this is it.
Okay. Okay. So, we do like this.
Oh, what are those arrows?
Oh, what are those arrows?
What are those arrows?
The arrows at the end of the lines are
The arrows at the end of the lines are
like going nuts. They're
like they're like phantom cars that are
like they're like phantom cars that are
just spinning there. Yeah.
just spinning there. Yeah.
Like there are no cars there, but they
Like there are no cars there, but they
just show us they're spinning.
Are dead cars still taking actions?
This should be like four

you probably could do something with

even then so for like multiGPU training
even then so for like multiGPU training
for instance right you immediately run

out of cores because if you're

bottlenecked by the sim even on 32 cores

then you go to 32 core 6GPU machine and
then you go to 32 core 6GPU machine and
you're still screwed right you can't do

that's the real issue

Let me do uh let's go look at the drone

Perfect timing for 3 0 as well.
I stole a little bit of your quitterian

we've got random actions in the sea.
Got the new style allocations. This is

That's nice.

I think it is equivalent to be fair, but

So, yeah, this thing has uh the drone
So, yeah, this thing has uh the drone
dynamics suck in this because I didn't
dynamics suck in this because I didn't
port the full things over. But uh this
port the full things over. But uh this
is like air to air, air to ground,
is like air to air, air to ground,
ground to air, ground to ground,

separate units, like six different types
separate units, like six different types
of separate units. Um yeah, so this is

the type of stuff we can do with with a
the type of stuff we can do with with a
little bit of control in buffer now. So
little bit of control in buffer now. So
I'm pretty excited about this drone
I'm pretty excited about this drone
stuff. Very nice. Plus, did you just see
stuff. Very nice. Plus, did you just see
the uh the order that was signed a
the uh the order that was signed a
couple days ago make uh America make it
couple days ago make uh America make it
a lot easier to do drone stuff in
a lot easier to do drone stuff in
America?
America?
No. No. Apparently, yeah, this is like
No. No. Apparently, yeah, this is like
literally the the drone boom is about to
literally the the drone boom is about to
start because of that. Yeah. Well,
start because of that. Yeah. Well,
that's good timing. Yeah, it's very good
that's good timing. Yeah, it's very good
timing. There will be stuff in here.

All right.
All right.
Massive in it. All these args. Cool.
You set the initial date like uh
You set the initial date like uh
We're doing reset. Yeah. Is there a

Um I think that was just the way it was
Um I think that was just the way it was
done in um one of the other examples.

Oh, okay. Yeah. So, you only need to
Oh, okay. Yeah. So, you only need to
specify like stuff that you want to be
specify like stuff that you want to be
able to change in the config, right? So,
able to change in the config, right? So,
like if you wanted to be able to specify
like if you wanted to be able to specify
the full state from config, then you

would do this, right? Okay. It's not
would do this, right? Okay. It's not
going to hurt anything. C as well.
going to hurt anything. C as well.
What's that? Could we remove it from

binding C then as well or is that Yes.
binding C then as well or is that Yes.
Yes, you could. You just have to you
Yes, you could. You just have to you
have to init it somewhere. So if it gets

calicked and you want it set to zero,
calicked and you want it set to zero,
you're good. Otherwise, it goes in,
you're good. Otherwise, it goes in,
right? Um
so now we have
this is the single agent invocation.
this is the single agent invocation.
There's actually like a single like a
There's actually like a single like a
oneliner that you can even do for this
oneliner that you can even do for this
um for a single agent, but when you're
um for a single agent, but when you're
going to multi- aent, it'll look like
going to multi- aent, it'll look like
this anyways.
this anyways.
Fine.
This is like a correct basic binding.
This is like a correct basic binding.
It's fine. Like this. And then we'll
It's fine. Like this. And then we'll
look at the main meat of this
look at the main meat of this

it's just the default policy pretty
it's just the default policy pretty

have the default policy, you don't even
have the default policy, you don't even
have to mess with it. can just like
have to mess with it. can just like

messing with it originally and it kind
messing with it originally and it kind

of and it just ended up being the same.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, I'll see I will look and see if I
Well, I'll see I will look and see if I
have anything that's iffy with that. Uh
have anything that's iffy with that. Uh
oh, the one thing I wanted to check is
oh, the one thing I wanted to check is
the action base.
the action base.
Okay, so you do have it being
Okay, so you do have it being
continuous. One of the things I've been
continuous. One of the things I've been
thinking about and one of the things
thinking about and one of the things
that might make training easier. Uh we
that might make training easier. Uh we
haven't done full experiments on this,
haven't done full experiments on this,
but so far it seems like discrete has
but so far it seems like discrete has
just been way easier to optimize than
just been way easier to optimize than
continuous. So one of the easiest things
continuous. So one of the easiest things
we could do here is like change this
we could do here is like change this
from box of four to like a multi-iscreet
from box of four to like a multi-iscreet
of 999 and nine and then you just
of 999 and nine and then you just
discretize the four motor like four or
discretize the four motor like four or
motor motor intensities to like nine
motor motor intensities to like nine
values. And then possibly it could be a
values. And then possibly it could be a
lot easier to learn. Possibly not. Um
lot easier to learn. Possibly not. Um
but yeah, that's after that's like
but yeah, that's after that's like
definitely worth doing. And then if you
definitely worth doing. And then if you
do that, you have to remember to change
do that, you have to remember to change
the types becomes int. So the action has
the types becomes int. So the action has
to become int. But yeah, that's it.
to become int. But yeah, that's it.
Right. Let's go to the main me of this.
Right. Let's go to the main me of this.
It's not that bad. 540 lines. A lot of
It's not that bad. 540 lines. A lot of
it's quturnian math as well. Yeah. Yeah.
it's quturnian math as well. Yeah. Yeah.
Will be. Well, I think only only a
Will be. Well, I think only only a
couple hundred is drone. The rest of it
couple hundred is drone. The rest of it
just like rail stuff.
just like rail stuff.
Cool. So, we've got Yeah, this is the
Cool. So, we've got Yeah, this is the
exact type of thing that I was like
exact type of thing that I was like
looking at having to do for uh my new
looking at having to do for uh my new
sim and then I went, "Ah, that looks
sim and then I went, "Ah, that looks
like hard physics."
like hard physics."
Yeah, this this took a bit of
Yeah, this this took a bit of
experimentation. Sure. Well, you're
experimentation. Sure. Well, you're
doing it at a good time when you're
doing it at a good time when you're
actually like you've recently done some
actually like you've recently done some
stuff at least in undergrad. Yeah.
stuff at least in undergrad. Yeah.
It's like there are a lot of these
It's like there are a lot of these
things that I could have done eight
things that I could have done eight
years ago that it's just like I have not
years ago that it's just like I have not
done that in forever.
done that in forever.
Yeah,
you got your basic math. Yeah, I
you got your basic math. Yeah, I
remember reading all this stuff a lot.
remember reading all this stuff a lot.
I had a fun time reading a bunch about
I had a fun time reading a bunch about
quitterians uh building the schooling,
quitterians uh building the schooling,
so I'm perfectly up to date on all this
so I'm perfectly up to date on all this
crap.
Client
Types are good
and time of So that will um this this
and time of So that will um this this
right here is probably a bad idea.
right here is probably a bad idea.
And the reason for that is this gives
And the reason for that is this gives
you time in seconds
you time in seconds
and
and
so this is going to call a netit. Uh
so this is going to call a netit. Uh
this is going to get called on each
this is going to get called on each
environment, right?
environment, right?
Yeah. Huffers really fast. Those are all
Yeah. Huffers really fast. Those are all
going to end to the same thing
going to end to the same thing
because you call s rand every time. So I
because you call s rand every time. So I
recently added I think it gets done for
recently added I think it gets done for
you. I have not rigorously tested this
you. I have not rigorously tested this
but
so here we look at what's this env
so here we look at what's this env
sand
sand
will seed
will seed
uh to this seed value here
uh to this seed value here
and then
and then
yeah you just pass you know you pass a
yeah you just pass you know you pass a
seed argument to this so it'll s rand
seed argument to this so it'll s rand
it'll set it to a different seed every
it'll set it to a different seed every
time. All right. Okay. But like you can
time. All right. Okay. But like you can
pass the seed from yourpi. I think you
pass the seed from yourpi. I think you
have this in here, right? When you init
have this in here, right? When you init
with the pie,
with the pie,
I basically I took care of it for you
I basically I took care of it for you
for this exact reason. Um seed right
for this exact reason. Um seed right
here. So this seed just like increment
here. So this seed just like increment
by one every time instead of just
by one every time instead of just
passing a static thing. Yeah. And then
passing a static thing. Yeah. And then
you should be good,
you should be good,
right? So that's one thing to definitely
right? So that's one thing to definitely
because that can really mess with stuff.
because that can really mess with stuff.
Do you do like obstacle generation or
Do you do like obstacle generation or
something?
something?
Not yet. No, we had that in the original
Not yet. No, we had that in the original
Python environment. Um, but it it makes
Python environment. Um, but it it makes
the maths a lot more complicated for
the maths a lot more complicated for
like collision.
like collision.
Yeah.
You can't just treat the drone as a
You can't just treat the drone as a
sphere and like
sphere and like
no radius. Um
no radius. Um
well we then you have to you have to
well we then you have to you have to
treat the colliders as spheres as well
treat the colliders as spheres as well
right? Oh yeah you have to do sphere box
right? Oh yeah you have to do sphere box
collision I guess right? Yeah yeah
collision I guess right? Yeah yeah
that's slightly annoying.
that's slightly annoying.
Yeah it's slightly annoying.
Yeah it's slightly annoying.
We originally did it with like vector
We originally did it with like vector
projections and stuff so it's not it's
projections and stuff so it's not it's
not crazy but it is probably another
not crazy but it is probably another
hundred lines or something. Yeah. Now,
hundred lines or something. Yeah. Now,
there will definitely be opportunity for
there will definitely be opportunity for
stuff. We're trying to figure out what
stuff. We're trying to figure out what
to do in the in the drone space because
to do in the in the drone space because
there's like the racing stuff. There's
there's like the racing stuff. There's
like defense stuff. There's there tons
like defense stuff. There's there tons
of different areas and we're kind of
of different areas and we're kind of
trying to figure out what we want to do.
We're looking for more industry stuff
We're looking for more industry stuff
cuz the wall of servers behind me does
cuz the wall of servers behind me does
not pay for itself.
All right. All right. What's the uh
All right. All right. What's the uh
what's the cost per box at the minute?
what's the cost per box at the minute?
I mean, the individual desktops when I
I mean, the individual desktops when I
first started getting them, they were
first started getting them, they were
like 4K and then they went up to like
like 4K and then they went up to like
5.5, I think, for one of the more recent
5.5, I think, for one of the more recent
ones I bought. If I want to buy more,
ones I bought. If I want to buy more,
they're quoting me at like 7K now, which
they're quoting me at like 7K now, which
is ridiculous because of the Yeah. And
is ridiculous because of the Yeah. And
then the tiny boxes are 25k each. So,
then the tiny boxes are 25k each. So,
those are fun. Yeah.
those are fun. Yeah.
So, yeah. Like 100,000 bucks worth of
So, yeah. Like 100,000 bucks worth of
hardware.
But it is very fast.
But it is very fast.
And uh if I were to rent if I were to
And uh if I were to rent if I were to
rent like an 8 8x 800, it's not even
rent like an 8 8x 800, it's not even
really that much faster than a tiny box
really that much faster than a tiny box
like at all. Um yeah, that would be 100
like at all. Um yeah, that would be 100
bucks per day,
bucks per day,
right? Okay. Oh, no, I'm sorry. 100
right? Okay. Oh, no, I'm sorry. 100
bucks per day. 200 bucks per day from
bucks per day. 200 bucks per day from
the best provider. Second best provider,
the best provider. Second best provider,
400 bucks a day.
400 bucks a day.
Like the hardware prices are just like
Like the hardware prices are just like
they just make up numbers. It's crazy.
they just make up numbers. It's crazy.
Yeah.
The logic is below this
rotor offsets. Oh, do you draw the
rotor offsets. Oh, do you draw the
rotors?
rotors?
Yeah, we just draw little spheres sort
Yeah, we just draw little spheres sort
of positioned in across around the the

There's a video on the Oh, you just you
There's a video on the Oh, you just you
made the Okay. Well, I'm going to run
made the Okay. Well, I'm going to run
this afterwards. Uh, sure. Maybe I
this afterwards. Uh, sure. Maybe I
should
I got a quadcopter model. I can like
I got a quadcopter model. I can like
Oh, okay. You just I see what you did.
Oh, okay. You just I see what you did.
Okay, cool.
Yeah, we can totally get you a
Yeah, we can totally get you a
quadcopter. Yeah, this thing behaves
quadcopter. Yeah, this thing behaves
like way more realistically than my my
like way more realistically than my my
drones do.
drones do.
So, that is solid. Yeah, that that took
So, that is solid. Yeah, that that took
a while.
That's definitely solid.
That's definitely solid.
And I think that like right after we
And I think that like right after we
release, pretty much right after we
release, pretty much right after we
release, I'm going to be doing a lot of
release, I'm going to be doing a lot of
like drone stuff personally, a lot of my

The the first iteration of the physics
The the first iteration of the physics
was a bit a bit crazy. Um was just doing
was a bit a bit crazy. Um was just doing
like barrel rolls and stuff and like
like barrel rolls and stuff and like
just flying upside down, but
just flying upside down, but
managed to fix it since then.
managed to fix it since then.
Yeah. Yeah. It's uh
Yeah. Yeah. It's uh
well also we'll get you the the nice
well also we'll get you the the nice
quadcopter model board and stuff as
quadcopter model board and stuff as
well. Mhm.
Then I think just generally this whole
Then I think just generally this whole
like kind of like a four-point thrust
like kind of like a four-point thrust
model, didn't you? Yeah. Yeah. So that
model, didn't you? Yeah. Yeah. So that
type of stuff in general, if we could
type of stuff in general, if we could
like if we can just figure out because I
like if we can just figure out because I
don't want to go to like a full physics
don't want to go to like a full physics
engine, they're so heavy and so
engine, they're so heavy and so
annoying. But like if we can just figure
annoying. But like if we can just figure
out like a basic like point mass thrust
out like a basic like point mass thrust
model. Um like that would be that would
model. Um like that would be that would
unlock a lot of control stuff for us,
unlock a lot of control stuff for us,
you know? Like that's kind of already
you know? Like that's kind of already
enough to get like a bunch of different

This I looked at
Nicely normalized observations. Good.
What may be normalized? No. Is it unit?
What may be normalized? No. Is it unit?
It gets normalized later. Yeah, it's but
It gets normalized later. Yeah, it's but
in the ops.
in the ops.
Well, I don't know what the max I don't
Well, I don't know what the max I don't
know what the max values are. If they go
know what the max values are. If they go
up to like just pi or if it gets more
up to like just pi or if it gets more
Yeah. And after after every C step we
Yeah. And after after every C step we
normalize it. Good then. Yeah. Then this
normalize it. Good then. Yeah. Then this
is well done. This is like what you
is well done. This is like what you
want. Perfect.

Nice. and
and
what are your thoughts on clamping the
what are your thoughts on clamping the
actions between negative one and one at

this at the top there?
this at the top there?
Is that is that just fine? Uh yeah, you
Is that is that just fine? Uh yeah, you
can do it. You're just you're going to
can do it. You're just you're going to
deal with continuous jank for now. Uh
deal with continuous jank for now. Uh
this is that was my one big suggestion
this is that was my one big suggestion
was to discretise. So discretise and RNG
was to discretise. So discretise and RNG
are the two big things so far. Um that
are the two big things so far. Um that
actually could make a big difference. Uh
actually could make a big difference. Uh
because like continuous what we've seen
because like continuous what we've seen
there's a whole bunch have you seen like
there's a whole bunch have you seen like
unstable training with Nans?
unstable training with Nans?
Uh no. Okay. Well then maybe you're just
Uh no. Okay. Well then maybe you're just
good. But in a lot of continuous things
good. But in a lot of continuous things
we see like just stuff gets out of
we see like just stuff gets out of
whack. Um
whack. Um
and we don't know if it's fundamental or
and we don't know if it's fundamental or
if like there's a way around it. But
if like there's a way around it. But
like so far our best results on M's have
like so far our best results on M's have
been with with discrete also right pet

peeve don't use tabs and this is not
peeve don't use tabs and this is not
just a me thing like everyone will tell
just a me thing like everyone will tell
you don't use tabs I thought you said
you don't use tabs I thought you said
last last time you like tabs I I changed
last last time you like tabs I I changed
it to tabs just for you wait what okay
it to tabs just for you wait what okay
who the tells you
who the tells you
no no no no no it was spaced it was cuz
no no no no no it was spaced it was cuz
you had it too spaced I said use four
you had it too spaced I said use four
spaced so when I I think I said use four
spaced so when I I think I said use four
spaced tabs, which means use tabs that
spaced tabs, which means use tabs that
like when you tab it expands to four
like when you tab it expands to four
spaces.
spaces.
Yeah, that that's that's fine. I can I
Yeah, that that's that's fine. I can I
can fix that. No, no, no, no, no. I
can fix that. No, no, no, no, no. I
didn't. There's this funny result that
didn't. There's this funny result that
everyone sites whenever you post code
everyone sites whenever you post code
with tabs, which is there's like there's
with tabs, which is there's like there's
this funny statistic that programmers uh
this funny statistic that programmers uh
who use tabs make less.
who use tabs make less.
Okay, don't use tabs. But no, the real
Okay, don't use tabs. But no, the real
reason that you don't use tabs is
reason that you don't use tabs is
because they're really easy to screw up
because they're really easy to screw up
and mix with spaces, which is really
and mix with spaces, which is really
annoying. Yeah.
annoying. Yeah.
Right. So, everyone just sets tab
Right. So, everyone just sets tab
expand.
expand.
Yeah. It was all um It was all spaces
Yeah. It was all um It was all spaces
before. I just It was two space though,
before. I just It was two space though,
wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, that
wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, that
was the thing. I I don't know why it did
was the thing. I I don't know why it did
that, but
that, but
I can sort that out. Yeah. Just change
I can sort that out. Yeah. Just change
that. It's easy. All right. And now body
that. It's easy. All right. And now body
frame. I will merge this though before I
frame. I will merge this though before I
make you do that because this is we
make you do that because this is we
should get this Epic.
Very epic.
I've been so tempted to like buy some
I've been so tempted to like buy some
quadcopter parts and start like
quadcopter parts and start like
soldering stuff.
How much are they nowadays? Less than
How much are they nowadays? Less than
servers.
servers.
Okay, fine.
But I do remember that they sometimes
But I do remember that they sometimes
are quite difficult. Uh I had I remember
are quite difficult. Uh I had I remember
I had a high school buddy who ordered
I had a high school buddy who ordered
like a really nice one. It's part of
like a really nice one. It's part of
like the robotic stuff he was doing and
like the robotic stuff he was doing and
it was like impossibly small to like
it was like impossibly small to like
solder stuff.
solder stuff.
Like nobody could actually solder it.
Like nobody could actually solder it.
We've managed to stay well clear of that
We've managed to stay well clear of that
so far.
We have to get this running on a real
We have to get this running on a real
quadcopter, right? See if it works. We
quadcopter, right? See if it works. We
have We have tried um but not with a
have We have tried um but not with a
very good quadcopter, so it didn't go
very good quadcopter, so it didn't go
very well. I actually think I know how
very well. I actually think I know how
to help you with that. Um do you know
to help you with that. Um do you know
how do you know how domain randomization
how do you know how domain randomization
works?
works?
It was just the the drone we had was so
It was just the the drone we had was so
bad you just couldn't read data from it
bad you just couldn't read data from it
fast enough to Ah, okay. That'll be an
fast enough to Ah, okay. That'll be an
issue. But if it's the physics, you know
issue. But if it's the physics, you know
how domain randomization works. Is this
how domain randomization works. Is this
like randomizing the parameters of the
like randomizing the parameters of the
the end? Yeah. Including the physics,
the end? Yeah. Including the physics,
you jitter the laws of physics a little
you jitter the laws of physics a little
bit. Like you can jitter acceleration
bit. Like you can jitter acceleration
and jitter like what happens. And the
and jitter like what happens. And the
idea is you end up having to learn a
idea is you end up having to learn a
ridiculously robust policy, but whatever
ridiculously robust policy, but whatever
the heck the conditions are in the real
the heck the conditions are in the real
world, you're just good. Now, this is
world, you're just good. Now, this is
not this doesn't work like on its own
not this doesn't work like on its own
perfectly for stuff like humanoids, but
perfectly for stuff like humanoids, but
for quadcopters with like it's zero
for quadcopters with like it's zero
degrees of freedom for Yeah, you're
degrees of freedom for Yeah, you're
totally good. Mhm. So,
totally good. Mhm. So,
I'm just about to push up the fixed uh
I'm just about to push up the fixed uh
indentation. If you hold on a sec, uh
indentation. If you hold on a sec, uh
integrate quturnian.
integrate quturnian.
What? Hang on. I don't know if that's
What? Hang on. I don't know if that's
the correct terminology, but let me let
the correct terminology, but let me let
me actually make sure. All right. So,
me actually make sure. All right. So,

yeah, this is like this is really nice.
yeah, this is like this is really nice.
This is the exact type of thing I was
This is the exact type of thing I was
trying to figure out how to do. Um, this
trying to figure out how to do. Um, this
is just really well done.
is just really well done.
Cheers. Thank you.
Cheers. Thank you.
If we could figure out how to make like
If we could figure out how to make like
um
um
like an easy way to just apply this
like an easy way to just apply this
level of physics sim like a couple
level of physics sim like a couple
different form factors, we we could do a
different form factors, we we could do a
lot of stuff with this. Heck, even just
lot of stuff with this. Heck, even just
the drone like the one quadcopter drone
the drone like the one quadcopter drone
form factor is already pretty dang good.
form factor is already pretty dang good.
Yeah, I can very easily show you how to
Yeah, I can very easily show you how to
like apply randomization and stuff to
like apply randomization and stuff to
this as well.
this as well.
Nice.
Nice.
Yeah, we've got plenty of time this
Yeah, we've got plenty of time this
summer. Well, enough time. Awesome. Good
summer. Well, enough time. Awesome. Good
to go. That's awesome. Yeah, this is
to go. That's awesome. Yeah, this is
perfect timing as well because we're
perfect timing as well because we're
very much like we are looking to do
very much like we are looking to do
stuff in drone space. Um we're still
stuff in drone space. Um we're still
trying to figure out who we're going to
trying to figure out who we're going to
like pitch stuff to, but uh yeah,
like pitch stuff to, but uh yeah,
they're like we could definitely figure
they're like we could definitely figure
something out with this.
something out with this.
I've just pushed another commit which
I've just pushed another commit which
fixes all the indentation.
Thank you. So
Thank you. So
from definition dot
from definition dot
Yeah, you just times by half for some
Yeah, you just times by half for some
reason just
reason just
probably the thing.
probably the thing.
So this is
that you is this acceleration is it
that you is this acceleration is it
uh accelerations usually get
uh accelerations usually get
one half no v gets an acceler
velocity gets acceleration because
velocity gets acceleration because
second integral whatever.
Okay, I see what you mean by
Okay, I see what you mean by
integrations. This is just a um
yeah, that that could maybe be improved,
yeah, that that could maybe be improved,
but it it's fine. Does does the job. Um
but it it's fine. Does does the job. Um
this type of stuff usually gets to be
this type of stuff usually gets to be
unstable, I think, in long sims, but RL
unstable, I think, in long sims, but RL
is self-correcting, so like maybe this
is self-correcting, so like maybe this
just works. Yeah. We found with even
just works. Yeah. We found with even
like massive DT, it was just fine. It
like massive DT, it was just fine. It
just kind of did its thing. Yeah. Yeah.
just kind of did its thing. Yeah. Yeah.
Because I RL is just selfcorrecting
Because I RL is just selfcorrecting
like Yeah. The question will be the sim
like Yeah. The question will be the sim
to real gap, right? Yeah. You sure? I
to real gap, right? Yeah. You sure? I
don't know.
remember to stop

elicit oiler can be unstable.
elicit oiler can be unstable.
Yeah, I am aware of uh I'm aware of
Yeah, I am aware of uh I'm aware of
that. I don't know if you need RK4 for
that. I don't know if you need RK4 for
something like this though because like
something like this though because like
your goal is not to have a system and
your goal is not to have a system and
then just run it for many steps and have
then just run it for many steps and have
it match the real outcome. Um,
you have a self-correcting control
you have a self-correcting control
system, but I don't know if you need
system, but I don't know if you need
something like RK4
something like RK4
like you I mean, it wouldn't be a big
like you I mean, it wouldn't be a big
change anyway. So,
change anyway. So,
before I just don't want to have to look
before I just don't want to have to look
at the math.
at the math.
Yeah, fair enough. We can we can do
Yeah, fair enough. We can we can do
that. Uh, it's it's one of those things
that. Uh, it's it's one of those things
where like I know I'm going to have to
where like I know I'm going to have to
go back at some point and like just
go back at some point and like just
relearn all the math, but it's like my
relearn all the math, but it's like my
brain has just gone so far in the
brain has just gone so far in the
direction of building It's like a
direction of building It's like a
very different skill. It's a very
very different skill. It's a very
different skill set. Like what do I
different skill set. Like what do I
think of all day is like how do I take
think of all day is like how do I take
incredibly complicated system and make
incredibly complicated system and make
it as simple as fast as possible. That's
it as simple as fast as possible. That's
basically all I think about all day
basically all I think about all day
which is very different from
which is very different from
the formalism.
When do you think 3.0 will release then?
When do you think 3.0 will release then?
Is it sort of couple days? It's got to
Is it sort of couple days? It's got to
just be done. Like we're It's just been
just be done. Like we're It's just been
so much work. I think at this point
so much work. I think at this point
we're getting all the things on the
we're getting all the things on the
site. I'm going to today attempt to find
site. I'm going to today attempt to find
somebody to cut me together a trailer. I
somebody to cut me together a trailer. I
like I don't know where. I'm going to
like I don't know where. I'm going to
see maybe Upwork. I got to find somebody
see maybe Upwork. I got to find somebody
who does like trailer like intros for
who does like trailer like intros for
YouTubers or whatever. I want somebody
YouTubers or whatever. I want somebody
who will like work with me just to find
who will like work with me just to find
some cool way to present this stuff.
some cool way to present this stuff.
Like I give them all the clips of the
Like I give them all the clips of the
environments. They'll find like some way
environments. They'll find like some way
to cut together like a 30 second trailer
to cut together like a 30 second trailer
thing for this and hopefully we get a
thing for this and hopefully we get a
lot of eyes on this cuz like basically
lot of eyes on this cuz like basically
at this point I've worked on this for
at this point I've worked on this for
over a year. Um pretty much double time.
over a year. Um pretty much double time.
Um
Um
yeah, it's this last few weeks in
yeah, it's this last few weeks in
particular.

Uh, yeah, we're in a decent enough
Uh, yeah, we're in a decent enough
position where I can like maintain
position where I can like maintain
servers and such, but I want to be able
servers and such, but I want to be able
to grow this to where I can be like
to grow this to where I can be like
actually bringing more people on uh and
actually bringing more people on uh and
having, you know, this be like a proper
having, you know, this be like a proper
private research lab where we're really
private research lab where we're really
really accelerating the field. Um, so
really accelerating the field. Um, so
for that it's like I got to find ways to
for that it's like I got to find ways to
like get more eyes on and find some
like get more eyes on and find some
bigger contracts for us. That's kind of
bigger contracts for us. That's kind of
the next thing. And hey, drone space is
the next thing. And hey, drone space is
definitely one of those.
definitely one of those.
Yeah, that sounds super cool. I can't
Yeah, that sounds super cool. I can't
lie. Well, I think I think we're in if
lie. Well, I think I think we're in if
if you want any help with anything.
if you want any help with anything.
Absolutely. I got to figure out in what
Absolutely. I got to figure out in what
capacity, but like I was I already as
capacity, but like I was I already as
soon as I saw like the quality of this
soon as I saw like the quality of this
code, I was like, "All right, I got to
code, I was like, "All right, I got to
figure out what capacity." But yeah, we
figure out what capacity." But yeah, we
should do something for this. Yep. Cool.
like it's kind of on me to like first
like it's kind of on me to like first
actually get a formal contract before I
actually get a formal contract before I
hire people or like pay people for a
hire people or like pay people for a
specific project. So, I got to figure
specific project. So, I got to figure
that part out. But then yeah, we can uh
that part out. But then yeah, we can uh
do something with this. Cool.
drag
render. Actually, I do want to see on
render. Actually, I do want to see on
the rendering how you did
the rendering how you did
Yeah, cuz there's this annoying thing
Yeah, cuz there's this annoying thing
where you have to like redo you have to
where you have to like redo you have to
like redo the calcs, right? In order to
like redo the calcs, right? In order to
figure out how to how to render it in
figure out how to how to render it in

world space, right?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I had to deal with
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I had to deal with
this as well.
this as well.
The Rail code is probably the bit we're
The Rail code is probably the bit we're
most unsure on because it it's not the
most unsure on because it it's not the
first C code we've ever written
first C code we've ever written
obviously, but it is the first RALIB
obviously, but it is the first RALIB
we've ever written. So, it's a bit
we've ever written. So, it's a bit
trickier. So, with this thing, I think I
trickier. So, with this thing, I think I
might have actually found something that
might have actually found something that
can help you.
can help you.
Mhm. How you're doing the rod. You have

And where do you get the orientation?
And where do you get the orientation?
Hang on.

And where do you get the
Okay, you just do this plot rotate.
This is actually fairly clean.
So, the way that I did this, I'll show
So, the way that I did this, I'll show
you

this. This also took me a while. Like, I
this. This also took me a while. Like, I
know that this stuff is annoying.
know that this stuff is annoying.
Yeah.
You want to see a a big end? Well,
You want to see a a big end? Well,
admittedly, this is way larger than it
admittedly, this is way larger than it
needs to be.
needs to be.
I did this like a couple weeks ago. Um,
I did this like a couple weeks ago. Um,
it has all these different units
it has all these different units
and got the clock math in it.
and got the clock math in it.
The way that I did this for again this
The way that I did this for again this
math with the ray one
is
okay. So
all I did is I got I did a quaternian to
all I did is I got I did a quaternian to

on the orientation which is the plot of
on the orientation which is the plot of
the the model and I just set the

Yeah. So this ended up being super easy.
Yeah. So this ended up being super easy.
Everything else I tried would just like
Everything else I tried would just like
screw it up. And like it looks like you
screw it up. And like it looks like you
did get the math there eventually, but
did get the math there eventually, but
something like this might be easier. Um,
something like this might be easier. Um,
actually I wasn't I'm going to be
actually I wasn't I'm going to be
honest, I wasn't 100% sure about using
honest, I wasn't 100% sure about using
the array math functions because one
the array math functions because one
they're kind of verbose, but also like
they're kind of verbose, but also like
you know if one of them is slow for
you know if one of them is slow for
whatever reason then it's like I'm going
whatever reason then it's like I'm going
to have to go rewrite a bunch of crap.
to have to go rewrite a bunch of crap.
Um, and I don't know I think I looked
Um, and I don't know I think I looked
and I think that they use float 32
and I think that they use float 32
default not 64. It's like it's
default not 64. It's like it's
reasonable but I don't know if there's
reasonable but I don't know if there's
anything in there that like needs to be
anything in there that like needs to be
improved. So, I'm not 100% on just using
improved. So, I'm not 100% on just using
the ray botmath. I would be equally
the ray botmath. I would be equally
happy uh just making our own like
happy uh just making our own like
standalone quitterians.h or whatever. Uh
standalone quitterians.h or whatever. Uh
if that's the way we want to go like
if that's the way we want to go like
basically just take yours and add a
basically just take yours and add a
couple extra functions and we could just
couple extra functions and we could just
be good there. The only thing is we
be good there. The only thing is we
would have to output we'd have to have
would have to output we'd have to have
like something to output this ray
like something to output this ray
transform. I think that's like the
transform. I think that's like the
easiest way to draw it. It shouldn't be
easiest way to draw it. It shouldn't be
that hard. It's just
that hard. It's just
like this is just like a super basic
like this is just like a super basic

for it, right? And then
for it, right? And then
yeah, let's go. Let's go run this and
yeah, let's go. Let's go run this and
see what we what we can do here.

about 2,000 to a million steps per
about 2,000 to a million steps per

ridiculous. And I've sort of I've worked
ridiculous. And I've sort of I've worked
on making it easier and easier. And then
on making it easier and easier. And then
like this environment when I made this,
like this environment when I made this,
this was one of the first things I did
this was one of the first things I did
after graduating. It just didn't it just
after graduating. It just didn't it just
didn't train well at all. And then kind
didn't train well at all. And then kind
of just like over the course of making
of just like over the course of making
the algorithm better and better and all
the algorithm better and better and all
the improvements we've made, this is
the improvements we've made, this is
just like a slightly bit bigger model
just like a slightly bit bigger model

right now. So,
like yeah, this thing is very quickly

that's silly. That is just silly.
that's silly. That is just silly.
Actually, here we'll get a baseline
Actually, here we'll get a baseline
first. We'll see if I can improve your

look like it's perfect yet.
look like it's perfect yet.
No, it definitely definitely isn't.
No, it definitely definitely isn't.
Well, you have two. All right, I'm going
Well, you have two. All right, I'm going
to teach you something here. So,
to teach you something here. So,
you know how
you know how
did anybody ever tell you about like
did anybody ever tell you about like
local minima in a deep learning?
local minima in a deep learning?
Yeah. Okay. Now, did anybody ever tell
Yeah. Okay. Now, did anybody ever tell
you that that's a lie?
you that that's a lie?
Uh, no. Okay. So, there's this whole
Uh, no. Okay. So, there's this whole
kurfuffle here. So, we'll give you a
kurfuffle here. So, we'll give you a
history lesson. Old man Suarez will give
history lesson. Old man Suarez will give
you a history lesson. So, and around
you a history lesson. So, and around
like 2015, there was this whole
like 2015, there was this whole
kurfuffle where like people were just
kurfuffle where like people were just
like worried their optimizers just
like worried their optimizers just
weren't working or whatever, right? And
weren't working or whatever, right? And
the idea was that, hey, these are
the idea was that, hey, these are
massive non-convex optimization
massive non-convex optimization
landscapes and you're going to hit all
landscapes and you're going to hit all
these local minima. So, there was all
these local minima. So, there was all
this research on that and eventually
this research on that and eventually
there was some fancy paper that came
there was some fancy paper that came
along and said, "Hey, actually local
along and said, "Hey, actually local
minima just don't exist." Um, right? And
minima just don't exist." Um, right? And
the intuition for this is very simple.
the intuition for this is very simple.
If you flip a coin, heads or tails,
If you flip a coin, heads or tails,
every single dimension, you flip a coin,
every single dimension, you flip a coin,
heads or tails. If they all come up
heads or tails. If they all come up
tails, then you're stuck in a local
tails, then you're stuck in a local
minima,
minima,
right? Because you can go in one
right? Because you can go in one
direction or another. The derivative can
direction or another. The derivative can
be up or it can be down. So they all
be up or it can be down. So they all
have to come up heads. Now, that's not
have to come up heads. Now, that's not
true because that models them as like
true because that models them as like
completely independent, but in practice,
completely independent, but in practice,
it ends up being a good enough
it ends up being a good enough
explanation. So you know you just can't
explanation. So you know you just can't
get local minima because there's always
get local minima because there's always
going to be some direction on which you
going to be some direction on which you
can improve. Now if you go from a
can improve. Now if you go from a
million dimensions down to a relatively
million dimensions down to a relatively
small number of dimensions you get local
small number of dimensions you get local
minima again and you get non-convex
minima again and you get non-convex
optimization. Okay. So this is why in
optimization. Okay. So this is why in
general we don't use dimensions that are
general we don't use dimensions that are
lower than like 128 and we at least use
lower than like 128 and we at least use
neural nets that have more than 2,800
neural nets that have more than 2,800

like in this case it's like okay
whatever it's 128 but it's just a

have any representation capacity. You
have any representation capacity. You
literally have one hidden layer. All

Okay, I'm going to quickly swap over to
Okay, I'm going to quickly swap over to
my phone in in hopes I can see this
my phone in in hopes I can see this
stream. I'll be one second. Okay, so
stream. I'll be one second. Okay, so
we've got 130,000 more parameters. Well,
we've got 130,000 more parameters. Well,
and it's not any slower, is it? No.
At least not on a 4090.

Yeah.
Come on, drone. You got this.
Come on, drone. You got this.
Do we know what max score is? It's just
Do we know what max score is? It's just
5.0.
5.0.
Oh, is 5.0 the best you can possibly do?
Oh, is 5.0 the best you can possibly do?
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. Then yeah, we
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, okay. Then yeah, we
should just set PF equal to score over
should just set PF equal to score over
five and then we'll have a one zero

Mhm. That's basically full solved.
So cool. All right. Boom. There we go.
So cool. All right. Boom. There we go.
It's doing it.
That's pretty decent.

Yeah.
Yeah.
All right. So, I wanted to check your

This is the target, right? Yeah.
Let's just do uh
just try something real quick.
just try something real quick.
All right, that seems

okay.
This is a position independent encoding.

regardless of where the target is. Yeah.
Okay, that's already training faster.
Okay, that's already training faster.
Yeah,
Yeah,
sometimes the RL food is quite simple.

Yeah.
We were we were saying to some other
We were we were saying to some other
people the other day like back
people the other day like back
back when um back when we were using gym
back when um back when we were using gym
and trying to train drone, we were
and trying to train drone, we were
operating our dorm room as like a data
operating our dorm room as like a data

just do it in five minutes.
just do it in five minutes.
Hey, that is the uh that is the point.
Hey, that is the uh that is the point.
Yeah,
Yeah,
I'm not spending the rest of my 20s here
I'm not spending the rest of my 20s here
working out of a warehouse for uh in the
working out of a warehouse for uh in the
middle of nowhere for no reason, right?
middle of nowhere for no reason, right?
Cuz we're building some cool stuff.
So, that should be substantially easier
So, that should be substantially easier
here.
still is going to cap about the same
still is going to cap about the same
because it's solved either way.
There you have it. Now, let's see.
What should we do?
I don't know if this will mess it up to
I don't know if this will mess it up to
be fair, but we will just fix this for
be fair, but we will just fix this for
you.
you.
Thank you.
probably doesn't mess anything up
probably doesn't mess anything up
because probably what happens initialize
because probably what happens initialize
them all the same but then because the
them all the same but then because the
RNG is the like the RNG is in C is um I
RNG is the like the RNG is in C is um I
believe it's process level so even
believe it's process level so even
though you seed it it's like as soon as
though you seed it it's like as soon as
it starts calling RNG functions from
it starts calling RNG functions from
different ends on the same process

probably desyncs anyways

Mhm. Right. I mean, you can see here
Mhm. Right. I mean, you can see here
it's like that's 90% solved in less than
it's like that's 90% solved in less than
30 seconds. Yeah.
Only 1.2 million steps per second.
Let me check something.
Oh.
Oh.
[Music]
Just try.
Let's just see if that does any. No,
this this end should be faster than
this this end should be faster than
this. You know, a million steps a second
this. You know, a million steps a second
is really any good here.
is really any good here.
Let's see if it still trains though.
Let's see if it still trains though.
That's the question.
That's the question.
There you go. 3 mil. Whoa. Okay,
There you go. 3 mil. Whoa. Okay,
that's like more What did you just
that's like more What did you just
change? I like looked away for half a
change? I like looked away for half a
second. It was 3 million steps per
second. It was 3 million steps per
second. Uh, so it is I set back now is
second. Uh, so it is I set back now is
eight. So you've got 8,000 total drones
eight. So you've got 8,000 total drones
or 81 8192 total drones. I bumped up the
or 81 8192 total drones. I bumped up the
mini batch size a little bit. Mhm. And
mini batch size a little bit. Mhm. And
it looks like it still solves.
So, we just cut the training time down
So, we just cut the training time down
to uh 35 seconds total.
to uh 35 seconds total.
Still solves. Yeah.
Still solves. Yeah.
Well, we can just we'll leave you these
Well, we can just we'll leave you these
uh these parameters in.
uh these parameters in.
Nice.
Nice.
Just so you can see.
It does in fact work as I say.
It does in fact work as I say.
Very nice.
Very nice.
35 second training to get a drone
35 second training to get a drone
policy.
a pretty cool looking one as well if I
a pretty cool looking one as well if I
if I do say so myself.
if I do say so myself.
Yeah, it's like
very cool. Is there gravity?
very cool. Is there gravity?
Yep. Yeah, there is. Right. Okay. Yeah,
Yep. Yeah, there is. Right. Okay. Yeah,
they like it looks like pretty dang
they like it looks like pretty dang
reasonable.
I mean, to do this in real life, you'd
I mean, to do this in real life, you'd
need a pretty nippy drone, but I imagine
need a pretty nippy drone, but I imagine
imagine you can get one.
imagine you can get one.
That's actually something we were
That's actually something we were
considering looking at is like we could
considering looking at is like we could
if we were to do some hardware stuff.
if we were to do some hardware stuff.
Um, we could make our own drones that
Um, we could make our own drones that
would be ridiculously agile, just
would be ridiculously agile, just
basically impossible to control for a
basically impossible to control for a
human. And then we could RL them and we
human. And then we could RL them and we
have superhuman drones and then we're
have superhuman drones and then we're
funded infinitely
funded infinitely
because that is a that would be a easy
because that is a that would be a easy
nine figure contract.
nine figure contract.
Wow. Right. Okay. I mean, think about
Wow. Right. Okay. I mean, think about
it, right? Like it's like, hey, we have
it, right? Like it's like, hey, we have
superhumanly agile drones that are
superhumanly agile drones that are
autonomously controlled,
autonomously controlled,
right? Yeah.
right? Yeah.
Just don't forget us. Okay. Yeah. Oh, of
Just don't forget us. Okay. Yeah. Oh, of
course. Hey, I'm just I'm just thinking
course. Hey, I'm just I'm just thinking
about like, hey, where do I get contract
about like, hey, where do I get contract
so I bring uh I get you guys involved
so I bring uh I get you guys involved
because we're going to need more people
because we're going to need more people
on this stuff. I don't want to be doing
on this stuff. I don't want to be doing
this is actually the one thing I don't
this is actually the one thing I don't
want to be doing is fiddling with the
want to be doing is fiddling with the
damn the damn uh you know, fiddling with
damn the damn uh you know, fiddling with
the math all day to like make sure it's
the math all day to like make sure it's
to get it more and more realistic.
to get it more and more realistic.
Yeah. because you know there might be
Yeah. because you know there might be
I'm sure that there are some additional
I'm sure that there are some additional
forces or some additional phenomena that
forces or some additional phenomena that
are not accounted for in this right yeah
are not accounted for in this right yeah
there's like gyroscopic effects and
there's like gyroscopic effects and
stuff that we didn't consider and it
stuff that we didn't consider and it
wasn't too much more complicated to add
wasn't too much more complicated to add

just like three lines
just like three lines
nothing

yeah
yeah
I think all like the planes and stuff
I think all like the planes and stuff
the physics for those is going to be
the physics for those is going to be
more of a mess but really the uh that
more of a mess but really the uh that
sim is more it's not that one that I

made this like the large scale battle
made this like the large scale battle

tactics more than anything which uh the

and the obser can't even see each other
and the obser can't even see each other
in that and they like already kind of
in that and they like already kind of
work. Mhm.
work. Mhm.
A look at that. That is solid.
I almost don't want to like put a
I almost don't want to like put a
quadcopter model in because you're not
quadcopter model in because you're not
going to be able to tell as easily,
going to be able to tell as easily,
I guess. Yeah, we we found the colors
I guess. Yeah, we we found the colors
helped tell the orientation quite well.
helped tell the orientation quite well.
I guess you could paint like the top of
I guess you could paint like the top of
it blue and the bottom of it red or
it blue and the bottom of it red or
something.
something.
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. And that
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. And that
would like kind of do it, but like you
would like kind of do it, but like you
still don't get the full
still don't get the full
Yeah. Yours is like pretty nice. I think
Yeah. Yours is like pretty nice. I think
it would probably be good. What we would
it would probably be good. What we would
do is we should have it on a toggle. We
do is we should have it on a toggle. We
should have it like actually be a
should have it like actually be a
quadcopter model, but then if you just
quadcopter model, but then if you just
press shift or whatever, press tab, then
press shift or whatever, press tab, then
uh yeah, it comes up.
I do have a quadcopter model for you,
I do have a quadcopter model for you,
but I don't think it it probably is not
but I don't think it it probably is not
just super trivial to add in. You'd have
just super trivial to add in. You'd have
to
to
maybe it is.
maybe it is.
I don't know. cuz you have to I don't
I don't know. cuz you have to I don't
know how you do the angle cuz the way
know how you do the angle cuz the way
you guys have it now it's just they're
you guys have it now it's just they're
spheres but I can show you the the model
spheres but I can show you the the model
that I have for this.
that I have for this.
Mhm. Yeah, sure.
Mhm. Yeah, sure.
Oh, wait. Did I
Oh, wait. Did I
No, I didn't get a quadcopter model.
No, I didn't get a quadcopter model.
It's like a different drone model. I
It's like a different drone model. I
forgot. So, we would have to get one.
forgot. So, we would have to get one.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz I I went with like
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz I I went with like
I got the sci-fi looking model, but we
I got the sci-fi looking model, but we
could easily get one. All right. Okay.
could easily get one. All right. Okay.
Presumably there's loads on like the
Presumably there's loads on like the
Unity asset store and places. Yeah,
Unity asset store and places. Yeah,
there are Turbo Squid everywhere.
Nice.
I mean,
I mean,
if you could do
if you could do
Trying to think how hard a ring
Trying to think how hard a ring

because basically if you just put rings
because basically if you just put rings
you you're like almost to a racing end.
you you're like almost to a racing end.
Yeah. Yeah. That would be cool. Like the
Yeah. Yeah. That would be cool. Like the
racing ms are just a bunch of rings.
racing ms are just a bunch of rings.
I think it's a little bit complicated
I think it's a little bit complicated
because what you basically you have to
because what you basically you have to
do is you have to generate like
do is you have to generate like
you have to is it like a bezier? You
you have to is it like a bezier? You
have to generate like some sort of like
have to generate like some sort of like
funky curve, right, that you use as the
funky curve, right, that you use as the
track and then you place some rings like
track and then you place some rings like
on that path. Yeah. Yeah. I've worked
on that path. Yeah. Yeah. I've worked
with Bezier curves before so that
with Bezier curves before so that
shouldn't be too bad. Mhm. And then this
shouldn't be too bad. Mhm. And then this
is perfect cuz like that's all the math
is perfect cuz like that's all the math
that I do not want to have to do. Okay.
that I do not want to have to do. Okay.
This perfect. Yeah. Cuz like I don't
This perfect. Yeah. Cuz like I don't

But like this stuff works. But like I
But like this stuff works. But like I
bet we could do stuff like this so much
bet we could do stuff like this so much
better and so much more easily now with

a complicated course. We could do way
a complicated course. We could do way
harder stuff than this.
harder stuff than this.
Yeah. These traces are pretty nice.
I'll think about how to do this. I think
I'll think about how to do this. I think

drone racing. Yeah, it makes sense,
drone racing. Yeah, it makes sense,
right?
right?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Looks fun. Yeah. I'd be awful at that.
Looks fun. Yeah. I'd be awful at that.
We'll stick to the code.
We'll stick to the code.
Okay. Now, for the fun part, let's get
Okay. Now, for the fun part, let's get
this onto the website for you
this onto the website for you
that All right. Now, the one thing is I
that All right. Now, the one thing is I
don't think you did the I don't think
don't think you did the I don't think
you did the C network stuff, right?
you did the C network stuff, right?
Uh, no. All right, I'll show you how to
Uh, no. All right, I'll show you how to
do that real quick. This is cool. I made
do that real quick. This is cool. I made
a thing to make it easy.
a thing to make it easy.
Cool.
Will it be on um like the the live
Will it be on um like the the live
website today or will it be when Puffer
website today or will it be when Puffer
Free releases? When releases. Right.
Free releases? When releases. Right.
Okay. Oh, and I'll need uh I'll have to
Okay. Oh, and I'll need uh I'll have to
get both of you. We'll add both of you
get both of you. We'll add both of you
to the uh the contributors section of
to the uh the contributors section of
that right now as well so that I don't
that right now as well so that I don't
forget to do it. Okay, cool.
forget to do it. Okay, cool.
What you do is you load in load in
What you do is you load in load in
weights like this.
Spencer, uh hey. Yeah, I'm on with the
Spencer, uh hey. Yeah, I'm on with the
drone guys in Discord now. Dude, they
drone guys in Discord now. Dude, they
did awesome work on this. Like, we
did awesome work on this. Like, we
should actually chat about what we can
should actually chat about what we can
do with industry stuff. Like, this is
do with industry stuff. Like, this is
freaking cool.
Well, it's like it's like four months
Well, it's like it's like four months
now before we're back with uni work. So,
now before we're back with uni work. So,
we're we're happy happy for whatever.
we're we're happy happy for whatever.
Let's get stuff.
Let's get stuff.
Let's get some stuff going fast. Let me
Let's get some stuff going fast. Let me
just show Let me just show you this real
just show Let me just show you this real
quick, Spencer. Like, look at this
quick, Spencer. Like, look at this
thing. Look at how cool the dynamics of
thing. Look at how cool the dynamics of
this thing are.
Like, that actually looks like how a
Like, that actually looks like how a
drone would move.
Unlike my sim where I have like tons of
Unlike my sim where I have like tons of
agents and it looks cool, but the
agents and it looks cool, but the
physics are jank as hell.
And the code for it is super clean, too.
All right. So, let me show you how this
All right. So, let me show you how this
works. So what you do
works. So what you do
huffer export
huffer export
hopper drone.
So all this does is this just takes the
So all this does is this just takes the
weights out of the pietorch network in
weights out of the pietorch network in
the order that they are listed and then
the order that they are listed and then
writes them to a binary file just like
writes them to a binary file just like
numpy saves them and that format is
numpy saves them and that format is
literally just like you know uh four
literally just like you know uh four
bytes for first weight float four bytes
bytes for first weight float four bytes
for second that's all it is. Mhm. Okay.
for second that's all it is. Mhm. Okay.
So what we do is we get this number
So what we do is we get this number
which is the total number of weights
which is the total number of weights
saved.
saved.
We uh we put this into here and this
We uh we put this into here and this
will work for you know whatever n uh
will work for you know whatever n uh
so now we just we need to know
so now we just we need to know
I didn't do continuous ah I didn't
I didn't do continuous ah I didn't
do continuous action sampling though. Oh
do continuous action sampling though. Oh
I'm I'm going to try to I'm going to try
I'm I'm going to try to I'm going to try
to hack it. But yeah I didn't do
to hack it. But yeah I didn't do
continuous action sampling in uh in
continuous action sampling in uh in
this. So, the thing that I wanted to
this. So, the thing that I wanted to
show you though that's really cool,
show you though that's really cool,
right? Um,
right? Um,
the thing I wanted to show you that's
the thing I wanted to show you that's
really cool is basically this thing.
really cool is basically this thing.
This is pufferet.
This is pufferet.
This is
This is
I don't know if I've mentioned but I
I don't know if I've mentioned but I
might have. Is this PyTorch and C? Yes,
might have. Is this PyTorch and C? Yes,
this is PyTorch and Pure C. Yeah. So we
this is PyTorch and Pure C. Yeah. So we
have a 700 line file that has some
have a 700 line file that has some
common architectures has comms, linear
common architectures has comms, linear
layers, LSTMs exactly matching the way
layers, LSTMs exactly matching the way
that it's written in PyTorch and tested.
that it's written in PyTorch and tested.
So what you can do is you can take your
So what you can do is you can take your
PyTorch weights, you can load them in,
PyTorch weights, you can load them in,
you do it in C, you compile the web
you do it in C, you compile the web
assembly and then for small networks
assembly and then for small networks
they just run in your browser. Yeah,
they just run in your browser. Yeah,
that's very nice. Which is like if you
that's very nice. Which is like if you
tried to run stuff and compile for your
tried to run stuff and compile for your
browser before, it's a total nightmare.
browser before, it's a total nightmare.
So this was the easy way of doing it.
All right.
Slightly annoying.
What I'll do is I'll just do like this.
Custom. We'll custom it.
It's not that bad. There's only this
It's not that bad. There's only this
amount of code.

Now this should load this in. We need to
Now this should load this in. We need to
know the ob size of 16. Is it 16? Yes.
know the ob size of 16. Is it 16? Yes.
16 I think. So yeah, what it says

First of all, we'll check if the numbers

Find integer over.
Oh, you know why?
Oh, you know why?
What?
There we go. My bad. Now it doesn't seem
There we go. My bad. Now it doesn't seem
to do anything.
So I believe it's
So I believe it's
you output the mean.
Did you just output the action mean
Did you just output the action mean
directly?

I think for deterministic stuff. Yeah.
Normal. So this would just give you the

normal
normal
normal sample.
normal sample.
Yeah,
I would think that that would work
I would think that that would work
correctly, right? Because like if you
correctly, right? Because like if you
just tell it, hey, you have a four-way
just tell it, hey, you have a four-way
discrete output sampler.

And actually, oh, hang on. Now, now that
And actually, oh, hang on. Now, now that
we fixed that error, I got to shift the
we fixed that error, I got to shift the

Oh, yeah.
Ah, there we go. Nice.
It's not exact, right? It's not exactly
It's not exact, right? It's not exactly

there.
Maybe it's Do you think Do we think it's
Maybe it's Do you think Do we think it's
relying on that sampling?
It could be relying on the uh on the

That's very possible. Yeah, we we'd find

when you when you slow it right down, it
when you when you slow it right down, it
can sometimes hover like that presumably

Uh, we will hack you a

We'll hack you a sampler.

That's actually kind of hard as well

literally the same day ask me like,

This looks sweet.

That's better than I play.
That's better than I play.
It's far better than I play. Yeah, I
It's far better than I play. Yeah, I
don't think I have ever played. Uh you
don't think I have ever played. Uh you
you'll be able to play it here if you
you'll be able to play it here if you
just hold shift like this is now this is
just hold shift like this is now this is
me playing technically and uh uh my I'm

It's doing the shift thing, but it's

Left shift
and then
and then
that we have to
Okay. So,
Okay. So,
uh let's try to make sure that this is
uh let's try to make sure that this is
the same first and then we'll add the
the same first and then we'll add the
standard deviation.

And uh if this works and we decide that

we're just weird then I will uh later

I'll make you guys just like a more

Cool. Cool.
That's a pain. I know.
That's a pain. I know.
Wait a guess.
I know this was like one of the first
I know this was like one of the first
things I did on buffer because it like
things I did on buffer because it like
it let me run p your end to end on the
it let me run p your end to end on the
web and then that's kind of when I
web and then that's kind of when I
started committing to doing all this
started committing to doing all this
stuff in C
because it like makes a big difference
because it like makes a big difference
when you can actually talk through demos

on the

I X.
Okay. Okay. So this is the same as
Okay. Okay. So this is the same as
before where it can like drift but it

Now we do your log

that's so that's kind of funny that like
that's so that's kind of funny that like
it actually depends on um the
it actually depends on um the

Mhm.
Yeah, we found that quite a lot with the
Yeah, we found that quite a lot with the
like the old old drone.
So I had to hack a couple things for you
So I had to hack a couple things for you
for this, but um it does appear to work.
for this, but um it does appear to work.
So we can put this on the website just
So we can put this on the website just
like that.
Get rid of total steps.
Uh we also do need to get rid of uh
Uh we also do need to get rid of uh
these prints.
All right. So now the the magic here is
All right. So now the the magic here is
literally just change this from fast to

Mhm.
Mhm.
And then um
single generator

see
this copy all that stuff. Uh, we do we
this copy all that stuff. Uh, we do we
get a thumbnail.
That
That
cool.
And then all I have to do is add you

All I have to do is add you a template.
You put drone.

Let's see. Right at the top, surely.

Not too far from it.
We'll do right after the really big

Okay, so
Okay, so
two things we got to do. One is check
two things we got to do. One is check

It looks slower. Is that It does look
It looks slower. Is that It does look
slower, doesn't it?
Can't possibly be from lag.
See how you have it and see
not window close.
You have target FPS set to
I can't imagine that this would be
I can't imagine that this would be
low.
Is anything trading at the minute or
Is anything trading at the minute or
shouldn't be?
shouldn't be?
You check the other Ms.
Yeah. All that. Oh, but the drone itself
Yeah. All that. Oh, but the drone itself
is Is there anything based on time?
is Is there anything based on time?
Um, I don't think so. Not Not really.
Um, I don't think so. Not Not really.
No, nothing based on frame cuz like look
No, nothing based on frame cuz like look
at this. This seems to be moving.

Like these stats seem to be updating at

a reasonable rate. Yeah.
Okay. That's a little thing. I do get
Okay. That's a little thing. I do get
some lag on this end, but I get lag on

Oh,
Oh,
it's not lag. Yeah, it's there's
it's not lag. Yeah, it's there's
something with mcripting, right?
You know, it might be something with
You know, it might be something with
like these continuous ends where like I
like these continuous ends where like I
think your browser kind of just decides
think your browser kind of just decides
to render stuff whenever. There might

have to be some sort of interpolation,

right?
Bit of a bummer. It's it's slower on
Bit of a bummer. It's it's slower on

All right, let me get you onto the site
All right, let me get you onto the site
first and then out because there's also
first and then out because there's also
you also get to go on this page.
Go right.
I'll reverse it. I'll do it one order
I'll reverse it. I'll do it one order
one way and the other the other. That's
one way and the other the other. That's
chill. Yeah, that's good. Nice.
Awesome.
Rocket Lander was No, Rocket Lander was

Kyle attempt Morganstein attempted to do

show dronec again? Yeah, Adrian. Uh,
show dronec again? Yeah, Adrian. Uh,
it's just in a while window not window

Why is it a linear cont?
Why is it a linear cont?

Just a random. It doesn't look like it.
Definitely faster here. Much faster.
easiest.
easiest.
Oh, easiest fix for this. Hang on.
I just build it half a faster FPS. See
I just build it half a faster FPS. See
if it like
if it like
120 didn't fix it for me. Did you try
120 didn't fix it for me. Did you try
this?
I've tried everything that you'll think
I've tried everything that you'll think
of in the next few hours. Lovely.
of in the next few hours. Lovely.
Great.
It's weird because we definitely we have
It's weird because we definitely we have
ends where it's not a problem.
The whole web ecosystem is kind of just
The whole web ecosystem is kind of just
broken. Uh web web people don't actually
broken. Uh web web people don't actually
know how to write code. Turns out I mean
know how to write code. Turns out I mean
you can just look at React and say
you can just look at React and say
really these people know how to write
really these people know how to write
code? No, they don't.
So 120 doesn't seem to fix it at all.
So 120 doesn't seem to fix it at all.
Right.
Right.
It's just it's just frame rate capped it
It's just it's just frame rate capped it
looks like.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Banner.
Banner.
All right. So,
All right. So,
um, band-aid patch
for speed.
What are you looking for? Actually, here
What are you looking for? Actually, here
what we can do is
I know what we're going to do to fix
I know what we're going to do to fix
this.

Okay,
assuming the rendering is slow, we'll
assuming the rendering is slow, we'll
just down sample the rendering to 30
just down sample the rendering to 30
while keeping the internals the same.
while keeping the internals the same.
Mhm.
size issue. You mean a size issue?
size issue. You mean a size issue?
So, that's super fast when I do it
So, that's super fast when I do it
locally, but
I don't know if it actually I don't know
I don't know if it actually I don't know
if it's actually reloaded to this thing.
if it's actually reloaded to this thing.
We'd have to do something to test if
We'd have to do something to test if
it's actually been reloaded. Right.
Let's crank it like way the heck up.
Let's crank it like way the heck up.
Mhm.
like sometimes it just cashes.
Uh, and actually hang on.
Ah, see that's what I was afraid of.
Okay.
So that is the uh
So that is the uh
the ridiculous down sampled one. Yeah.
Can't tell if that's any faster.
Can't tell if that's any faster.
Yeah.
Does seem slower, right? Yeah,
Does seem slower, right? Yeah,
definitely.
So, I know that you can get this type of

stuff if you don't have put this in a Y

loop or whatever. You can screw it up.

Um, but the way it's supposed to work is
Um, but the way it's supposed to work is
that the only difference with web versus
that the only difference with web versus
uh local your browser kind of just
uh local your browser kind of just
decides when it's going to give you

compute time. Um,
compute time. Um,
think that there should be anything
think that there should be anything
super heavy though this end flag at all.
super heavy though this end flag at all.
I mean, there's definitely a performance
I mean, there's definitely a performance
factor gap between um like web and
factor gap between um like web and
normal, but like I if I do I should be
normal, but like I if I do I should be
able to do your end at like 600 FPS
able to do your end at like 600 FPS
locally, no problem.
See if this
See if this
Yeah. So, this is this is fast drone.
Yeah. So, this is this is fast drone.
Yeah.
This is like the type of this is the
This is like the type of this is the
type of drone that we would like to
type of drone that we would like to
create.
create.
Right. This is the type of drone we
Right. This is the type of drone we
would like to create.
I mean that's like Yeah.
Oh, I wonder if it's this thing.
trying to fix this for you because it's
trying to fix this for you because it's
like it's such a length.
like it's such a length.
Yeah, it be nice if it's if it's full
Yeah, it be nice if it's if it's full
speed.
So
So
yeah.
Okay. Another thing
me data.
Yeah. I'm trying to think what it would
Yeah. I'm trying to think what it would
be that they have right like
Don't believe this is window ready for
Don't believe this is window ready for
sure
your code in for no reason.
It's weird because I don't actually see
It's weird because I don't actually see
this on my ends like except for the uh
this on my ends like except for the uh
the ones where it's obviously going to
the ones where it's obviously going to
lag because the net is too slow.
lag because the net is too slow.
Do we think it's text?
Do we think it's text?
It very well could be. Like it could be
It very well could be. Like it could be
that the mcript and like the text is
that the mcript and like the text is
just different.
just different.
You made some changes to Terraform C
You made some changes to Terraform C
dynamics to not be so aggressive. No, I
dynamics to not be so aggressive. No, I
made changes to uh the controls in the C
made changes to uh the controls in the C
so that it would not I made changes to
so that it would not I made changes to
the controls and the uh the way that
the controls and the uh the way that
actions are gotten from your presses. So
actions are gotten from your presses. So
it doesn't set you to like the max Excel
it doesn't set you to like the max Excel
instantly. I should not have changed the
instantly. I should not have changed the
C dynamics.
No, it is not pushed. But it should not
No, it is not pushed. But it should not
change your policy.
Okay. So this is the normal speed,
Okay. So this is the normal speed,
right?
right?
Yep.
Of course, there's one memory. My fault.
Still slow, isn't it?
Still slow, isn't it?
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Like maddening.
Have a sleep or something? You don't
Have a sleep or something? You don't
have like a sleep call anywhere?
have like a sleep call anywhere?
No. Okay.
No. Okay.
Got to love mcripton.
See rail mcript
See rail mcript
didn't render slow.
This is uh
This is uh
ridiculous.
Really good.
Really good.
M script in bad. Ray good.
Actually, I think Rayb's the best piece

of software I've ever worked with.

Mhm.
Mhm.
really good
brave. Why would I do that?
Got to work on Chrome.
I'm trying to think if there's any any

You don't have any trace logs here that
You don't have any trace logs here that

Uh, I think so. Yeah.

They're just for errors from slower than

This thing should render 600 FPS if we

Make
Okay. So, the way you did it is

technically fine.

because you make

this.
This is actually all redundant, funny
This is actually all redundant, funny
enough.
enough.
Literally just delete that.
Provided you do this,
we'll make it on the first reset.
Okay.
Okay.
How do I make your thing fast?
Trying to figure out here.
I mean the most likely thing I can think
I mean the most likely thing I can think
of because like it still looked slow
of because like it still looked slow
even when we did um this like tick down
even when we did um this like tick down
sampling right like even if I did this
sampling right like even if I did this
like here if I do this locally this
like here if I do this locally this
should be zoom in right
should be zoom in right
that's like not even
that's like not even
yeah that should just be zooming but
yeah that should just be zooming but
then if I do this on web
If this is slow, what this implies is
If this is slow, what this implies is
that the actual environment code itself
that the actual environment code itself
is running too slowly to keep up. Right?
is running too slowly to keep up. Right?
So look at this. The actual environment
So look at this. The actual environment
code itself is running too slowly to

something is compiling just garbage on

Right. Awesome.
Right. Awesome.
which is I know really really fun to

Got one more idea and then I got to

figure out meeting. Um yeah,
it's kind of reaching a bit but

I've kind of shown you the whole

Why do not work?
How did I break your ends?
I'm confused.
Come on. How did I How did I do that?
Come on. How did I How did I do that?
I didn't change anything, did I? I What

You on the right track here?
Um, hey, uh, am I audible? Yeah. Hey.
Um, hey, uh, am I audible? Yeah. Hey.
Yeah. So actually uh it's only one
Yeah. So actually uh it's only one
agent. Uh basically uh the problem is
agent. Uh basically uh the problem is
solving EFX allocation. So there are
solving EFX allocation. So there are
multiple agent which need to be
multiple agent which need to be
allocated items and they have utilities
allocated items and they have utilities
like each agent has a utility for an
like each agent has a utility for an
item. So the agent is not like multi
item. So the agent is not like multi
like real multi- agent R. It's just the
like real multi- agent R. It's just the
like the agent is only one. solving for
like the agent is only one. solving for
uh it's solving it's solving basically
uh it's solving it's solving basically
which um agent gets which item so that
which um agent gets which item so that
it's uh so that the allocation is NV3.
it's uh so that the allocation is NV3.
So then is the RL problem
So then is the RL problem
is it like on the allocation or is it
is it like on the allocation or is it
like an action of an agent
like it's on the allocation. So the
like it's on the allocation. So the
problem actually solves for the
problem actually solves for the
allocation. Okay. So then the agent is
allocation. Okay. So then the agent is
not the thing the thing that it's being
not the thing the thing that it's being
assigned to is not the agent. The agent
assigned to is not the agent. The agent
is the uh the allocator.
Uh no actually we allocate we allocate
Uh no actually we allocate we allocate
items to it. Yeah. Then what's the
items to it. Yeah. Then what's the
action space? What how by what mechanism
action space? What how by what mechanism
do you interact with this thing?
do you interact with this thing?
So uh in in one like for like when we

take an action we set the we set the
take an action we set the we set the
memory the Turing tape and the result

and the halt halt flag.
and the halt halt flag.
But how how I don't like there are two
But how how I don't like there are two
different problems here right like how
different problems here right like how
is it an allocation problem that's also
is it an allocation problem that's also
a touring machine problem like
a touring machine problem like
I'm confused. Sure.
I'm confused. Sure.
Okay. So, uh, basically what I'm trying
Okay. So, uh, basically what I'm trying
to learn an algorithm that allocates.
to learn an algorithm that allocates.
So,
So,
you're trying to learn an algorithm that
you're trying to learn an algorithm that
allocates.
allocates.
Yeah.
Something's got to happen with the
Something's got to happen with the
action space here because the action
action space here because the action
space is like nuts. Um,
space is like nuts. Um,
like here,
like here,
let's let's do it this way. So the
let's let's do it this way. So the
action space is the tape size plus the
action space is the tape size plus the
max items plus one. What is the action
max items plus one. What is the action
supposed to do? Like how is it supposed
supposed to do? Like how is it supposed
to be interpreted?
to be interpreted?
So uh the action basically what it does
So uh the action basically what it does
is uh at this moment it assigns um uh it
is uh at this moment it assigns um uh it
it assigns the memory. So whatever like
it assigns the memory. So whatever like
uh like if the action space is tape size
uh like if the action space is tape size
plus uh max items plus one the tape size
plus uh max items plus one the tape size
part of it just copies whatever it has
part of it just copies whatever it has
outputed to the memory tape. It just
outputed to the memory tape. It just
updates the tape. I'm I'm planning to
updates the tape. I'm I'm planning to
change that but yeah for for now it
change that but yeah for for now it
updates the tape this memory of the uh
updates the tape this memory of the uh
this the whole tape at once.
this the whole tape at once.
Yeah. And the tape is size 1500 isn't
Yeah. And the tape is size 1500 isn't

Yeah. Okay. So, you've just created

you've just created an impossible

The search space of that is ridiculous.
The search space of that is ridiculous.
I mean, it's like
I mean, it's like
you're trying to guess a point in 1500
you're trying to guess a point in 1500

learning that with one bit feedback
learning that with one bit feedback
which is the RL signal.
So like there are many things that you
So like there are many things that you
can do here right like and that's not
can do here right like and that's not
even how like usually a touring machine
even how like usually a touring machine
would work right like usually you have
would work right like usually you have
individual actions that can be taken but
individual actions that can be taken but
set a like setting an element of the
set a like setting an element of the
tape is reasonable for instance um
I think just structurally the end is a
I think just structurally the end is a
bit confused and then as to why it's
bit confused and then as to why it's
slow
Oh,
why is the tape even that big? Like,
why is the tape even that big? Like,
I could get it. Uh, I could get it a
I could get it. Uh, I could get it a
little less. I mean, it's I don't even
little less. I mean, it's I don't even
think it's like a matter to be fair. I
think it's like a matter to be fair. I
don't even think it's like a matter of
I don't think it's even a matter of
I don't think it's even a matter of
necessarily the tape being too big. It's
necessarily the tape being too big. It's
just in the way that you have the end
just in the way that you have the end
structured.
structured.
um
like you're trying to zero shot the
like you're trying to zero shot the
whole thing. Like is this still a
whole thing. Like is this still a
multi-step process if you're setting the
multi-step process if you're setting the
entire tape in one step?
entire tape in one step?
Yeah. No, actually it's a multi-step
Yeah. No, actually it's a multi-step
process. So, you know, it does it again.
process. So, you know, it does it again.
Okay. So, here it's like quadratic or
Okay. So, here it's like quadratic or
something because that made it 100. It
something because that made it 100. It
must be quadratic because I it just I
must be quadratic because I it just I
reduced by a factor of 10 and it got
reduced by a factor of 10 and it got
100x faster.
100x faster.
So you have what? However you're doing
So you have what? However you're doing
this has got to be like quadratic in
this has got to be like quadratic in
tape size or agents or something. Um
tape size or agents or something. Um
because that's 9 million steps a second
because that's 9 million steps a second
immediately.
So definitely look at like just the
So definitely look at like just the
complexity of how this thing scales. And
complexity of how this thing scales. And
then I I don't understand how it is that
then I I don't understand how it is that
you have a multi-step touring machine
you have a multi-step touring machine
process where it requires you to fully
process where it requires you to fully
set the memory of the tape at every
set the memory of the tape at every
step.
Right. Actually, I actually thought
Right. Actually, I actually thought
Yeah. Yeah. I I I thought about that. Uh
Yeah. Yeah. I I I thought about that. Uh
yeah, I'm just trying things out. Uh uh
yeah, I'm just trying things out. Uh uh
I mean uh I can actually still justify
I mean uh I can actually still justify
that whatever action it has taken in one
that whatever action it has taken in one
step, it's constant time. That's why I
step, it's constant time. That's why I
did this like I thought that the other
did this like I thought that the other
thing where I set only a section a bit

learn or something.
The thing that you have here is
The thing that you have here is
impossible to learn. Um
impossible to learn. Um
like algorithmically impossible. So,
like algorithmically impossible. So,
uh, yeah, I would suggest if you're
uh, yeah, I would suggest if you're
if you model this thing off of how a
if you model this thing off of how a
touring machine actually works, and it's

been a few years since I thought about
been a few years since I thought about
touring machines, but if you model this
touring machines, but if you model this
off of how a touring machine actually
off of how a touring machine actually
works, you should totally be able to RL

like move tape, read, write, like that
like move tape, read, write, like that

that could literally be like a

like increment, decrement by some fixed
like increment, decrement by some fixed
amount,
I guess. Read and store stuff like Yeah,
I guess. Read and store stuff like Yeah,
you literally end up with like a five or
you literally end up with like a five or
six dimensional discrete action. And
six dimensional discrete action. And
then this thing will run. You can even
then this thing will run. You can even
have the fullsize tape if you do that.
have the fullsize tape if you do that.
Uh, and then this thing should run
Uh, and then this thing should run
millions of steps per second and you
millions of steps per second and you
should be able to do stuff with it.
should be able to do stuff with it.
Yeah. Um, I'll do that. And then like
Yeah. Um, I'll do that. And then like
additionally,

the observation wouldn't be the entire
the observation wouldn't be the entire

Like I don't know if I were going to

right? What I would do is I'd let it see

So maybe it can see
So maybe it can see
maybe it can see like you know 16 places
maybe it can see like you know 16 places

and then it can just it can move it can

read it can write. Um, and then you can
read it can write. Um, and then you can
actually you will actually have a chance

I figure out where it actually like

Probably this, right?
Yeah, this is it.
Okay. Okay. So, we do like this.
Oh, what are those arrows?
Oh, what are those arrows?
What are those arrows?
The arrows at the end of the lines are
The arrows at the end of the lines are
like going nuts. They're
like they're like phantom cars that are

Perfect timing for 3 0 as well.
I stole a little bit of your quitterian

it only took me like four days. A day

think how like what we can apply this

stuff to now that we have all this
stuff to now that we have all this
cracked out RL. Um and drones is
cracked out RL. Um and drones is
actually a very good opportunity. So
actually a very good opportunity. So
there's probably some stuff around
there's probably some stuff around
puffer do with drones. Yeah. Yeah. We'd
puffer do with drones. Yeah. Yeah. We'd
like to make it multi- aent at some
like to make it multi- aent at some
point. Maybe like a like a tag
point. Maybe like a like a tag
environment or something like that. I
environment or something like that. I
mean I right now in this thing
I mean I don't have uh I gotta like
I mean I don't have uh I gotta like
actually make this thing
actually make this thing
I call it school.
I call it school.
That thing will train for a bit. Um and
That thing will train for a bit. Um and
I'll show you once this thing is it
I'll show you once this thing is it
looks really cool but the physics suck
looks really cool but the physics suck
in it so far but we're thinking of doing
in it so far but we're thinking of doing
things like that.
things like that.
So it should be a lot of fun. Can you
So it should be a lot of fun. Can you
see Can I see what? Sorry. Can you see
see Can I see what? Sorry. Can you see
the stream thing? Oh it's Yeah.
the stream thing? Oh it's Yeah.
Oh, okay. It's just me then. Never mind.
Oh, okay. It's just me then. Never mind.
Based on your mic, I think it's probably
Based on your mic, I think it's probably

connection.
Oh, really? Is it not good? It's like
Oh, really? Is it not good? It's like
dropping some packets or whatever. I
dropping some packets or whatever. I
think
think
All right. Okay. Oh, it's fine with me.
All right. Okay. Oh, it's fine with me.
Maybe it's a trans.
Maybe it's a trans.
Huh.
Huh.
Okay. That's weird.
Okay. That's weird.
I wouldn't think I would be having any
I wouldn't think I would be having any
streams at five yet. Streams at 6K.
streams at five yet. Streams at 6K.
Well, regardless, let me know if
Well, regardless, let me know if
anything that you miss here. Um,
anything that you miss here. Um,
is it system load?
All right. Whatever.
All right. Whatever.
I think it was actually not your mic. I
I think it was actually not your mic. I
think it's that it's my system's running
think it's that it's my system's running
at full because I launched this train
at full because I launched this train
job.
job.
All right. Okay. All right. That'll
All right. Okay. All right. That'll
that'll be done in a minute anyways. But
that'll be done in a minute anyways. But
um okay, so
um okay, so
we've got random actions in the sea.
Got the new style allocations. This is
Got the new style allocations. This is
like very very new style allocations.
like very very new style allocations.
That's nice.
That's nice.
Saves me time from refactoring.
I never even do these checks because
I never even do these checks because
like if you if you can't malic stuff,
like if you if you can't malic stuff,
you're kind of screwed anyways, but
you're kind of screwed anyways, but
sure.
Yeah, we haven't looked at this file in
Yeah, we haven't looked at this file in
a while, so should be fine. Should be
a while, so should be fine. Should be
fine. So yeah, like this is I never
fine. So yeah, like this is I never
really do this in the C because it's
really do this in the C because it's
like yes, technically if you want the
like yes, technically if you want the
program to have a 100% chance of running
program to have a 100% chance of running
without errors, you do this. But it adds
without errors, you do this. But it adds
like a ton of lines and it's literally
like a ton of lines and it's literally
like the only time this fails is if your
like the only time this fails is if your
system's out of memory,
system's out of memory,
right?
Hello. Hello.
Hello. Hello.
Let's see. So,
Let's see. So,
this is going to be the big file. We'll
this is going to be the big file. We'll
take a look at the other one first. I
take a look at the other one first. I
did steal some of this plot map. And
did steal some of this plot map. And
then I realized Rayb has uh you know,
then I realized Rayb has uh you know,
Ray actually has a lot of the plot math
Ray actually has a lot of the plot math
built in.
built in.
Right. Okay. Right. Yeah, we were
Right. Okay. Right. Yeah, we were
getting some like naming collisions, I
getting some like naming collisions, I
think. But yeah, we sort of went with
think. But yeah, we sort of went with
our own stuff.
our own stuff.
I tried I went with my own stuff first.
I tried I went with my own stuff first.
I think it is equivalent to be fair, but
I think it is equivalent to be fair, but
it is nice. is the one the the ray stuff
it is nice. is the one the the ray stuff
is the same and also it doesn't depend
is the same and also it doesn't depend
on having the rendering up like you
on having the rendering up like you
don't actually have to initi it's just
don't actually have to initi it's just
kind of the same thing as a standalone.
kind of the same thing as a standalone.
Oh, this this ran by the way. So here
Oh, this this ran by the way. So here
you can get a sense of the multi- aent.
you can get a sense of the multi- aent.
Uh this is not even a particularly good
Uh this is not even a particularly good
model, but
model, but
uh just to give you like a little idea
uh just to give you like a little idea
of what we can do with our RL now.
All right,
All right,
thousand agent. That's a lot bigger than
thousand agent. That's a lot bigger than
it was a couple weeks ago or maybe a
it was a couple weeks ago or maybe a
week ago. I think I there camera
week ago. I think I there camera
thousand agent battle environment.
thousand agent battle environment.
We'll actually see if they get too
We'll actually see if they get too
close. The lasers going off. Yeah,
close. The lasers going off. Yeah,
there.
there.
Zap. Very cool. Zap. Zap.
Zap. Very cool. Zap. Zap.
So, yeah, this thing has uh the drone
So, yeah, this thing has uh the drone
dynamics suck in this because I didn't
dynamics suck in this because I didn't
port the full things over. But uh this
port the full things over. But uh this
is like air to air, air to ground,
is like air to air, air to ground,
ground to air, ground to ground,
ground to air, ground to ground,
separate units, like six different types
separate units, like six different types
of separate units. Um yeah, so this is
of separate units. Um yeah, so this is
the type of stuff we can do with with a
the type of stuff we can do with with a
little bit of control in buffer now. So
little bit of control in buffer now. So
I'm pretty excited about this drone
I'm pretty excited about this drone
stuff. Very nice. Plus, did you just see
stuff. Very nice. Plus, did you just see
the uh the order that was signed a
the uh the order that was signed a
couple days ago make uh America make it
couple days ago make uh America make it
a lot easier to do drone stuff in
a lot easier to do drone stuff in
America?
America?
No. No. Apparently, yeah, this is like
No. No. Apparently, yeah, this is like
literally the the drone boom is about to
literally the the drone boom is about to
start because of that. Yeah. Well,
start because of that. Yeah. Well,
that's good timing. Yeah, it's very good
that's good timing. Yeah, it's very good
timing. There will be stuff in here.
timing. There will be stuff in here.
All right.
All right.
Massive in it. All these args. Cool.
You set the initial date like uh
You set the initial date like uh
We're doing reset. Yeah. Is there a
We're doing reset. Yeah. Is there a
reason though that you have the full
reason though that you have the full
initial state specified from Python?
initial state specified from Python?
Um I think that was just the way it was
Um I think that was just the way it was
done in um one of the other examples.
done in um one of the other examples.
Oh, okay. Yeah. So, you only need to
Oh, okay. Yeah. So, you only need to
specify like stuff that you want to be
specify like stuff that you want to be
able to change in the config, right? So,
able to change in the config, right? So,
like if you wanted to be able to specify
like if you wanted to be able to specify
the full state from config, then you
the full state from config, then you
would do this, right? Okay. It's not
would do this, right? Okay. It's not
going to hurt anything. C as well.
going to hurt anything. C as well.
What's that? Could we remove it from
What's that? Could we remove it from
binding C then as well or is that Yes.
binding C then as well or is that Yes.
Yes, you could. You just have to you
Yes, you could. You just have to you
have to init it somewhere. So if it gets
have to init it somewhere. So if it gets
calicked and you want it set to zero,
calicked and you want it set to zero,
you're good. Otherwise, it goes in,
you're good. Otherwise, it goes in,
right? Um
so now we have
this is the single agent invocation.
this is the single agent invocation.
There's actually like a single like a
There's actually like a single like a
oneliner that you can even do for this
oneliner that you can even do for this
um for a single agent, but when you're
um for a single agent, but when you're
going to multi- aent, it'll look like
going to multi- aent, it'll look like
this anyways.
this anyways.
Fine.
This is like a correct basic binding.
This is like a correct basic binding.
It's fine. Like this. And then we'll
It's fine. Like this. And then we'll
look at the main meat of this
look at the main meat of this
policy real quick. All
policy real quick. All
it's just the default policy pretty
it's just the default policy pretty
much. Oh yeah. You don't if you just
much. Oh yeah. You don't if you just
have the default policy, you don't even
have the default policy, you don't even
have to mess with it. can just like
have to mess with it. can just like
policy like just set policy equal
policy like just set policy equal
policy. Well, I think I think we were
policy. Well, I think I think we were
messing with it originally and it kind
messing with it originally and it kind
of and it just ended up being the same.
of and it just ended up being the same.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, I'll see I will look and see if I
Well, I'll see I will look and see if I
have anything that's iffy with that. Uh
have anything that's iffy with that. Uh
oh, the one thing I wanted to check is
oh, the one thing I wanted to check is
the action base.
the action base.
Okay, so you do have it being
Okay, so you do have it being
continuous. One of the things I've been
continuous. One of the things I've been
thinking about and one of the things
thinking about and one of the things
that might make training easier. Uh we
that might make training easier. Uh we
haven't done full experiments on this,
haven't done full experiments on this,
but so far it seems like discrete has
but so far it seems like discrete has
just been way easier to optimize than
just been way easier to optimize than
continuous. So one of the easiest things
continuous. So one of the easiest things
we could do here is like change this
we could do here is like change this
from box of four to like a multi-iscreet
from box of four to like a multi-iscreet
of 999 and nine and then you just
of 999 and nine and then you just
discretize the four motor like four or
discretize the four motor like four or
motor motor intensities to like nine
motor motor intensities to like nine
values. And then possibly it could be a
values. And then possibly it could be a
lot easier to learn. Possibly not. Um
lot easier to learn. Possibly not. Um
but yeah, that's after that's like
but yeah, that's after that's like
definitely worth doing. And then if you
definitely worth doing. And then if you
do that, you have to remember to change
do that, you have to remember to change
the types becomes int. So the action has
the types becomes int. So the action has
to become int. But yeah, that's it.
to become int. But yeah, that's it.
Right. Let's go to the main me of this.
Right. Let's go to the main me of this.
It's not that bad. 540 lines. A lot of
It's not that bad. 540 lines. A lot of
it's quturnian math as well. Yeah. Yeah.
it's quturnian math as well. Yeah. Yeah.
Will be. Well, I think only only a
Will be. Well, I think only only a
couple hundred is drone. The rest of it
couple hundred is drone. The rest of it
just like rail stuff.
just like rail stuff.
Cool. So, we've got Yeah, this is the
Cool. So, we've got Yeah, this is the
exact type of thing that I was like
exact type of thing that I was like
looking at having to do for uh my new
looking at having to do for uh my new
sim and then I went, "Ah, that looks
sim and then I went, "Ah, that looks
like hard physics."
like hard physics."
Yeah, this this took a bit of
Yeah, this this took a bit of
experimentation. Sure. Well, you're
experimentation. Sure. Well, you're
doing it at a good time when you're
doing it at a good time when you're
actually like you've recently done some
actually like you've recently done some
stuff at least in undergrad. Yeah.
stuff at least in undergrad. Yeah.
It's like there are a lot of these
It's like there are a lot of these
things that I could have done eight
things that I could have done eight
years ago that it's just like I have not
years ago that it's just like I have not
done that in forever.
done that in forever.
Yeah,
you got your basic math. Yeah, I
you got your basic math. Yeah, I
remember reading all this stuff a lot.
remember reading all this stuff a lot.
I had a fun time reading a bunch about
I had a fun time reading a bunch about
quitterians uh building the schooling,
quitterians uh building the schooling,
so I'm perfectly up to date on all this
so I'm perfectly up to date on all this
crap.
Client
Types are good
and time of So that will um this this
and time of So that will um this this
right here is probably a bad idea.
right here is probably a bad idea.
And the reason for that is this gives
And the reason for that is this gives
you time in seconds
you time in seconds
and
and
so this is going to call a netit. Uh
so this is going to call a netit. Uh
this is going to get called on each
this is going to get called on each
environment, right?
environment, right?
Yeah. Huffers really fast. Those are all
Yeah. Huffers really fast. Those are all
going to end to the same thing
going to end to the same thing
because you call s rand every time. So I
because you call s rand every time. So I
recently added I think it gets done for
recently added I think it gets done for
you. I have not rigorously tested this
you. I have not rigorously tested this
but
so here we look at what's this env
so here we look at what's this env
sand
sand
will seed
will seed
uh to this seed value here
uh to this seed value here
and then
and then
yeah you just pass you know you pass a
yeah you just pass you know you pass a
seed argument to this so it'll s rand
seed argument to this so it'll s rand
it'll set it to a different seed every
it'll set it to a different seed every
time. All right. Okay. But like you can
time. All right. Okay. But like you can
pass the seed from yourpi. I think you
pass the seed from yourpi. I think you
have this in here, right? When you init
have this in here, right? When you init
with the pie,
with the pie,
I basically I took care of it for you
I basically I took care of it for you
for this exact reason. Um seed right
for this exact reason. Um seed right
here. So this seed just like increment
here. So this seed just like increment
by one every time instead of just
by one every time instead of just
passing a static thing. Yeah. And then
passing a static thing. Yeah. And then
you should be good,
you should be good,
right? So that's one thing to definitely
right? So that's one thing to definitely
because that can really mess with stuff.
because that can really mess with stuff.
Do you do like obstacle generation or
Do you do like obstacle generation or
something?
something?
Not yet. No, we had that in the original
Not yet. No, we had that in the original
Python environment. Um, but it it makes
Python environment. Um, but it it makes
the maths a lot more complicated for
the maths a lot more complicated for
like collision.
like collision.
Yeah.
You can't just treat the drone as a
You can't just treat the drone as a
sphere and like
sphere and like
no radius. Um
no radius. Um
well we then you have to you have to
well we then you have to you have to
treat the colliders as spheres as well
treat the colliders as spheres as well
right? Oh yeah you have to do sphere box
right? Oh yeah you have to do sphere box
collision I guess right? Yeah yeah
collision I guess right? Yeah yeah
that's slightly annoying.
that's slightly annoying.
Yeah it's slightly annoying.
Yeah it's slightly annoying.
We originally did it with like vector
We originally did it with like vector
projections and stuff so it's not it's
projections and stuff so it's not it's
not crazy but it is probably another
not crazy but it is probably another
hundred lines or something. Yeah. Now,
hundred lines or something. Yeah. Now,
there will definitely be opportunity for
there will definitely be opportunity for
stuff. We're trying to figure out what
stuff. We're trying to figure out what
to do in the in the drone space because
to do in the in the drone space because
there's like the racing stuff. There's
there's like the racing stuff. There's
like defense stuff. There's there tons
like defense stuff. There's there tons
of different areas and we're kind of
of different areas and we're kind of
trying to figure out what we want to do.
We're looking for more industry stuff
We're looking for more industry stuff
cuz the wall of servers behind me does
cuz the wall of servers behind me does
not pay for itself.
All right. All right. What's the uh
All right. All right. What's the uh
what's the cost per box at the minute?
what's the cost per box at the minute?
I mean, the individual desktops when I
I mean, the individual desktops when I
first started getting them, they were
first started getting them, they were
like 4K and then they went up to like
like 4K and then they went up to like
5.5, I think, for one of the more recent
5.5, I think, for one of the more recent
ones I bought. If I want to buy more,
ones I bought. If I want to buy more,
they're quoting me at like 7K now, which
they're quoting me at like 7K now, which
is ridiculous because of the Yeah. And
is ridiculous because of the Yeah. And
then the tiny boxes are 25k each. So,
then the tiny boxes are 25k each. So,
those are fun. Yeah.
those are fun. Yeah.
So, yeah. Like 100,000 bucks worth of
So, yeah. Like 100,000 bucks worth of
hardware.
But it is very fast.
But it is very fast.
And uh if I were to rent if I were to
And uh if I were to rent if I were to
rent like an 8 8x 800, it's not even
rent like an 8 8x 800, it's not even
really that much faster than a tiny box
really that much faster than a tiny box
like at all. Um yeah, that would be 100
like at all. Um yeah, that would be 100
bucks per day,
bucks per day,
right? Okay. Oh, no, I'm sorry. 100
right? Okay. Oh, no, I'm sorry. 100
bucks per day. 200 bucks per day from
bucks per day. 200 bucks per day from
the best provider. Second best provider,
the best provider. Second best provider,
400 bucks a day.
400 bucks a day.
Like the hardware prices are just like
Like the hardware prices are just like
they just make up numbers. It's crazy.
they just make up numbers. It's crazy.
Yeah.
The logic is below this
rotor offsets. Oh, do you draw the
rotor offsets. Oh, do you draw the
rotors?
rotors?
Yeah, we just draw little spheres sort
Yeah, we just draw little spheres sort
of positioned in across around the the
of positioned in across around the the
central sphere.
central sphere.
There's a video on the Oh, you just you
There's a video on the Oh, you just you
made the Okay. Well, I'm going to run
made the Okay. Well, I'm going to run
this afterwards. Uh, sure. Maybe I
this afterwards. Uh, sure. Maybe I
should
I got a quadcopter model. I can like
I got a quadcopter model. I can like
Oh, okay. You just I see what you did.
Oh, okay. You just I see what you did.
Okay, cool.
Yeah, we can totally get you a
Yeah, we can totally get you a
quadcopter. Yeah, this thing behaves
quadcopter. Yeah, this thing behaves
like way more realistically than my my
like way more realistically than my my
drones do.
drones do.
So, that is solid. Yeah, that that took
So, that is solid. Yeah, that that took
a while.
That's definitely solid.
That's definitely solid.
And I think that like right after we
And I think that like right after we
release, pretty much right after we
release, pretty much right after we
release, I'm going to be doing a lot of
release, I'm going to be doing a lot of
like drone stuff personally, a lot of my
like drone stuff personally, a lot of my
time. Welcome, Ara.

The the first iteration of the physics
The the first iteration of the physics
was a bit a bit crazy. Um was just doing
was a bit a bit crazy. Um was just doing
like barrel rolls and stuff and like
like barrel rolls and stuff and like
just flying upside down, but
just flying upside down, but
managed to fix it since then.
managed to fix it since then.
Yeah. Yeah. It's uh
Yeah. Yeah. It's uh
well also we'll get you the the nice
well also we'll get you the the nice
quadcopter model board and stuff as
quadcopter model board and stuff as
well. Mhm.
Then I think just generally this whole
Then I think just generally this whole
like kind of like a four-point thrust
like kind of like a four-point thrust
model, didn't you? Yeah. Yeah. So that
model, didn't you? Yeah. Yeah. So that
type of stuff in general, if we could
type of stuff in general, if we could
like if we can just figure out because I
like if we can just figure out because I
don't want to go to like a full physics
don't want to go to like a full physics
engine, they're so heavy and so
engine, they're so heavy and so
annoying. But like if we can just figure
annoying. But like if we can just figure
out like a basic like point mass thrust
out like a basic like point mass thrust
model. Um like that would be that would
model. Um like that would be that would
unlock a lot of control stuff for us,
unlock a lot of control stuff for us,
you know? Like that's kind of already
you know? Like that's kind of already
enough to get like a bunch of different
enough to get like a bunch of different
vehicle types and form factors behaving

The actual
Oh, I totally just skipped over the
Oh, I totally just skipped over the
actual Yeah, it's just really quite
actual Yeah, it's just really quite
short. It's not I skipped over a lot of
short. It's not I skipped over a lot of
stuff somehow. Okay, here's your quat
stuff somehow. Okay, here's your quat
math.
math.
This I looked at
Nicely normalized observations. Good.
What may be normalized? No. Is it unit?
What may be normalized? No. Is it unit?
It gets normalized later. Yeah, it's but
It gets normalized later. Yeah, it's but
in the ops.
in the ops.
Well, I don't know what the max I don't
Well, I don't know what the max I don't
know what the max values are. If they go
know what the max values are. If they go
up to like just pi or if it gets more
up to like just pi or if it gets more
Yeah. And after after every C step we
Yeah. And after after every C step we
normalize it. Good then. Yeah. Then this
normalize it. Good then. Yeah. Then this
is well done. This is like what you
is well done. This is like what you
want. Perfect.
want. Perfect.
Nice. and
and
what are your thoughts on clamping the
what are your thoughts on clamping the
actions between negative one and one at
actions between negative one and one at
this at the top there?
this at the top there?
Is that is that just fine? Uh yeah, you
Is that is that just fine? Uh yeah, you
can do it. You're just you're going to
can do it. You're just you're going to
deal with continuous jank for now. Uh
deal with continuous jank for now. Uh
this is that was my one big suggestion
this is that was my one big suggestion
was to discretise. So discretise and RNG
was to discretise. So discretise and RNG
are the two big things so far. Um that
are the two big things so far. Um that
actually could make a big difference. Uh
actually could make a big difference. Uh
because like continuous what we've seen
because like continuous what we've seen
there's a whole bunch have you seen like
there's a whole bunch have you seen like
unstable training with Nans?
unstable training with Nans?
Uh no. Okay. Well then maybe you're just
Uh no. Okay. Well then maybe you're just
good. But in a lot of continuous things
good. But in a lot of continuous things
we see like just stuff gets out of
we see like just stuff gets out of
whack. Um
whack. Um
and we don't know if it's fundamental or
and we don't know if it's fundamental or
if like there's a way around it. But
if like there's a way around it. But
like so far our best results on M's have

like when you tab it expands to four
like when you tab it expands to four
spaces.
spaces.
Yeah, that that's that's fine. I can I
Yeah, that that's that's fine. I can I
can fix that. No, no, no, no, no. I
can fix that. No, no, no, no, no. I
didn't. There's this funny result that
didn't. There's this funny result that
everyone sites whenever you post code
everyone sites whenever you post code
with tabs, which is there's like there's
with tabs, which is there's like there's
this funny statistic that programmers uh
this funny statistic that programmers uh
who use tabs make less.
who use tabs make less.
Okay, don't use tabs. But no, the real
Okay, don't use tabs. But no, the real
reason that you don't use tabs is
reason that you don't use tabs is
because they're really easy to screw up
because they're really easy to screw up
and mix with spaces, which is really
and mix with spaces, which is really
annoying. Yeah.
annoying. Yeah.
Right. So, everyone just sets tab
Right. So, everyone just sets tab
expand.
expand.
Yeah. It was all um It was all spaces
Yeah. It was all um It was all spaces
before. I just It was two space though,
before. I just It was two space though,
wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, that
wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, that
was the thing. I I don't know why it did
was the thing. I I don't know why it did
that, but
that, but
I can sort that out. Yeah. Just change
I can sort that out. Yeah. Just change
that. It's easy. All right. And now body
that. It's easy. All right. And now body
frame. I will merge this though before I
frame. I will merge this though before I
make you do that because this is we
make you do that because this is we
should get this Epic.
Very epic.
I've been so tempted to like buy some
I've been so tempted to like buy some
quadcopter parts and start like
quadcopter parts and start like
soldering stuff.
How much are they nowadays? Less than
How much are they nowadays? Less than
servers.
servers.
Okay, fine.
But I do remember that they sometimes
But I do remember that they sometimes
are quite difficult. Uh I had I remember
are quite difficult. Uh I had I remember
I had a high school buddy who ordered
I had a high school buddy who ordered
like a really nice one. It's part of
like a really nice one. It's part of
like the robotic stuff he was doing and
like the robotic stuff he was doing and
it was like impossibly small to like
it was like impossibly small to like
solder stuff.
solder stuff.
Like nobody could actually solder it.
Like nobody could actually solder it.
We've managed to stay well clear of that
We've managed to stay well clear of that
so far.
We have to get this running on a real
We have to get this running on a real
quadcopter, right? See if it works. We
quadcopter, right? See if it works. We
have We have tried um but not with a
have We have tried um but not with a
very good quadcopter, so it didn't go
very good quadcopter, so it didn't go
very well. I actually think I know how
very well. I actually think I know how
to help you with that. Um do you know
to help you with that. Um do you know
how do you know how domain randomization
how do you know how domain randomization
works?
works?
It was just the the drone we had was so
It was just the the drone we had was so
bad you just couldn't read data from it
bad you just couldn't read data from it
fast enough to Ah, okay. That'll be an
fast enough to Ah, okay. That'll be an
issue. But if it's the physics, you know
issue. But if it's the physics, you know
how domain randomization works. Is this
how domain randomization works. Is this
like randomizing the parameters of the
like randomizing the parameters of the
the end? Yeah. Including the physics,
the end? Yeah. Including the physics,
you jitter the laws of physics a little
you jitter the laws of physics a little
bit. Like you can jitter acceleration
bit. Like you can jitter acceleration
and jitter like what happens. And the
and jitter like what happens. And the
idea is you end up having to learn a
idea is you end up having to learn a
ridiculously robust policy, but whatever
ridiculously robust policy, but whatever
the heck the conditions are in the real
the heck the conditions are in the real
world, you're just good. Now, this is
world, you're just good. Now, this is
not this doesn't work like on its own
not this doesn't work like on its own
perfectly for stuff like humanoids, but
perfectly for stuff like humanoids, but
for quadcopters with like it's zero
for quadcopters with like it's zero
degrees of freedom for Yeah, you're
degrees of freedom for Yeah, you're
totally good. Mhm. So,
totally good. Mhm. So,
I'm just about to push up the fixed uh
I'm just about to push up the fixed uh
indentation. If you hold on a sec, uh
indentation. If you hold on a sec, uh
integrate quturnian.
integrate quturnian.
What? Hang on. I don't know if that's
What? Hang on. I don't know if that's
the correct terminology, but let me let
the correct terminology, but let me let
me actually make sure. All right. So,
me actually make sure. All right. So,

Uh that is that'll be Z in the drone
Uh that is that'll be Z in the drone

yeah, this is like this is really nice.
yeah, this is like this is really nice.
This is the exact type of thing I was
This is the exact type of thing I was
trying to figure out how to do. Um, this
trying to figure out how to do. Um, this
is just really well done.
is just really well done.
Cheers. Thank you.
Cheers. Thank you.
If we could figure out how to make like
If we could figure out how to make like
um
um
like an easy way to just apply this
like an easy way to just apply this
level of physics sim like a couple
level of physics sim like a couple
different form factors, we we could do a
different form factors, we we could do a
lot of stuff with this. Heck, even just
lot of stuff with this. Heck, even just
the drone like the one quadcopter drone
the drone like the one quadcopter drone
form factor is already pretty dang good.
form factor is already pretty dang good.
Yeah, I can very easily show you how to
Yeah, I can very easily show you how to
like apply randomization and stuff to
like apply randomization and stuff to
this as well.
this as well.
Nice.
Nice.
Yeah, we've got plenty of time this
Yeah, we've got plenty of time this
summer. Well, enough time. Awesome. Good
summer. Well, enough time. Awesome. Good
to go. That's awesome. Yeah, this is
to go. That's awesome. Yeah, this is
perfect timing as well because we're
perfect timing as well because we're
very much like we are looking to do
very much like we are looking to do
stuff in drone space. Um we're still
stuff in drone space. Um we're still
trying to figure out who we're going to
trying to figure out who we're going to
like pitch stuff to, but uh yeah,
like pitch stuff to, but uh yeah,
they're like we could definitely figure
they're like we could definitely figure
something out with this.
something out with this.
I've just pushed another commit which
I've just pushed another commit which
fixes all the indentation.
Thank you. So
Thank you. So
from definition dot

Yeah, you just times by half for some
Yeah, you just times by half for some
reason just
reason just
probably the thing.
probably the thing.
So this is
that you is this acceleration is it
that you is this acceleration is it
uh accelerations usually get
uh accelerations usually get
one half no v gets an acceler
velocity gets acceleration because
velocity gets acceleration because
second integral whatever.
Okay, I see what you mean by
Okay, I see what you mean by
integrations. This is just a um
yeah, that that could maybe be improved,
yeah, that that could maybe be improved,
but it it's fine. Does does the job. Um
but it it's fine. Does does the job. Um
this type of stuff usually gets to be
this type of stuff usually gets to be
unstable, I think, in long sims, but RL
unstable, I think, in long sims, but RL
is self-correcting, so like maybe this
is self-correcting, so like maybe this
just works. Yeah. We found with even
just works. Yeah. We found with even
like massive DT, it was just fine. It
like massive DT, it was just fine. It
just kind of did its thing. Yeah. Yeah.
just kind of did its thing. Yeah. Yeah.
Because I RL is just selfcorrecting
Because I RL is just selfcorrecting
like Yeah. The question will be the sim
like Yeah. The question will be the sim

Yeah, I am aware of uh I'm aware of
Yeah, I am aware of uh I'm aware of
that. I don't know if you need RK4 for
that. I don't know if you need RK4 for
something like this though because like
something like this though because like
your goal is not to have a system and
your goal is not to have a system and
then just run it for many steps and have
then just run it for many steps and have
it match the real outcome. Um,
you have a self-correcting control
you have a self-correcting control
system, but I don't know if you need
system, but I don't know if you need
something like RK4
something like RK4
like you I mean, it wouldn't be a big
like you I mean, it wouldn't be a big
change anyway. So,
change anyway. So,
before I just don't want to have to look
before I just don't want to have to look
at the math.
at the math.
Yeah, fair enough. We can we can do
Yeah, fair enough. We can we can do
that. Uh, it's it's one of those things
that. Uh, it's it's one of those things
where like I know I'm going to have to
where like I know I'm going to have to
go back at some point and like just
go back at some point and like just
relearn all the math, but it's like my
relearn all the math, but it's like my
brain has just gone so far in the
brain has just gone so far in the
direction of building It's like a
direction of building It's like a
very different skill. It's a very
very different skill. It's a very
different skill set. Like what do I
different skill set. Like what do I
think of all day is like how do I take
think of all day is like how do I take
incredibly complicated system and make
incredibly complicated system and make
it as simple as fast as possible. That's
it as simple as fast as possible. That's
basically all I think about all day
basically all I think about all day
which is very different from
which is very different from
the formalism.
When do you think 3.0 will release then?
When do you think 3.0 will release then?
Is it sort of couple days? It's got to
Is it sort of couple days? It's got to
just be done. Like we're It's just been
just be done. Like we're It's just been
so much work. I think at this point
so much work. I think at this point
we're getting all the things on the
we're getting all the things on the
site. I'm going to today attempt to find
site. I'm going to today attempt to find
somebody to cut me together a trailer. I
somebody to cut me together a trailer. I
like I don't know where. I'm going to
like I don't know where. I'm going to
see maybe Upwork. I got to find somebody
see maybe Upwork. I got to find somebody
who does like trailer like intros for
who does like trailer like intros for
YouTubers or whatever. I want somebody
YouTubers or whatever. I want somebody
who will like work with me just to find
who will like work with me just to find
some cool way to present this stuff.
some cool way to present this stuff.
Like I give them all the clips of the
Like I give them all the clips of the
environments. They'll find like some way
environments. They'll find like some way
to cut together like a 30 second trailer
to cut together like a 30 second trailer
thing for this and hopefully we get a
thing for this and hopefully we get a
lot of eyes on this cuz like basically
lot of eyes on this cuz like basically
at this point I've worked on this for
at this point I've worked on this for
over a year. Um pretty much double time.
over a year. Um pretty much double time.
Um
Um
yeah, it's this last few weeks in
yeah, it's this last few weeks in
particular.
particular.
Uh, yeah, we're in a decent enough
Uh, yeah, we're in a decent enough
position where I can like maintain
position where I can like maintain
servers and such, but I want to be able
servers and such, but I want to be able
to grow this to where I can be like
to grow this to where I can be like
actually bringing more people on uh and
actually bringing more people on uh and
having, you know, this be like a proper
having, you know, this be like a proper
private research lab where we're really
private research lab where we're really
really accelerating the field. Um, so
really accelerating the field. Um, so
for that it's like I got to find ways to
for that it's like I got to find ways to
like get more eyes on and find some
like get more eyes on and find some
bigger contracts for us. That's kind of
bigger contracts for us. That's kind of
the next thing. And hey, drone space is
the next thing. And hey, drone space is
definitely one of those.
definitely one of those.
Yeah, that sounds super cool. I can't
Yeah, that sounds super cool. I can't
lie. Well, I think I think we're in if
lie. Well, I think I think we're in if
if you want any help with anything.
if you want any help with anything.
Absolutely. I got to figure out in what
Absolutely. I got to figure out in what
capacity, but like I was I already as
capacity, but like I was I already as
soon as I saw like the quality of this
soon as I saw like the quality of this
code, I was like, "All right, I got to
code, I was like, "All right, I got to
figure out what capacity." But yeah, we
figure out what capacity." But yeah, we
should do something for this. Yep. Cool.
like it's kind of on me to like first
like it's kind of on me to like first
actually get a formal contract before I
actually get a formal contract before I
hire people or like pay people for a
hire people or like pay people for a
specific project. So, I got to figure
specific project. So, I got to figure
that part out. But then yeah, we can uh
that part out. But then yeah, we can uh
do something with this. Cool.
drag
render. Actually, I do want to see on
render. Actually, I do want to see on
the rendering how you did
the rendering how you did
Yeah, cuz there's this annoying thing
Yeah, cuz there's this annoying thing
where you have to like redo you have to
where you have to like redo you have to
like redo the calcs, right? In order to
like redo the calcs, right? In order to
figure out how to how to render it in
figure out how to how to render it in
world space, right?
world space, right?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I had to deal with
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I had to deal with
this as well.
this as well.
The Rail code is probably the bit we're
The Rail code is probably the bit we're
most unsure on because it it's not the
most unsure on because it it's not the
first C code we've ever written
first C code we've ever written
obviously, but it is the first RALIB
obviously, but it is the first RALIB
we've ever written. So, it's a bit
we've ever written. So, it's a bit
trickier. So, with this thing, I think I
trickier. So, with this thing, I think I
might have actually found something that
might have actually found something that
can help you.
can help you.
Mhm. How you're doing the rod. You have

And where do you get the orientation?
And where do you get the orientation?
Hang on.
Sphere.

And where do you get the
Okay, you just do this plot rotate.
This is actually fairly clean.
So, the way that I did this, I'll show
So, the way that I did this, I'll show
you
you
this. This also took me a while. Like, I
this. This also took me a while. Like, I
know that this stuff is annoying.
know that this stuff is annoying.
Yeah.
You want to see a a big end? Well,
You want to see a a big end? Well,
admittedly, this is way larger than it
admittedly, this is way larger than it
needs to be.
needs to be.
I did this like a couple weeks ago. Um,
I did this like a couple weeks ago. Um,
it has all these different units
it has all these different units
and got the clock math in it.
and got the clock math in it.
The way that I did this for again this
The way that I did this for again this
math with the ray one
is
okay. So
all I did is I got I did a quaternian to
all I did is I got I did a quaternian to
matrix

on the orientation which is the plot of
on the orientation which is the plot of
the the model and I just set the
the the model and I just set the
transform.

Yeah. So this ended up being super easy.
Yeah. So this ended up being super easy.
Everything else I tried would just like
Everything else I tried would just like
screw it up. And like it looks like you
screw it up. And like it looks like you
did get the math there eventually, but
did get the math there eventually, but
something like this might be easier. Um,
something like this might be easier. Um,
actually I wasn't I'm going to be
actually I wasn't I'm going to be
honest, I wasn't 100% sure about using
honest, I wasn't 100% sure about using
the array math functions because one
the array math functions because one
they're kind of verbose, but also like
they're kind of verbose, but also like
you know if one of them is slow for
you know if one of them is slow for
whatever reason then it's like I'm going
whatever reason then it's like I'm going
to have to go rewrite a bunch of crap.
to have to go rewrite a bunch of crap.
Um, and I don't know I think I looked
Um, and I don't know I think I looked
and I think that they use float 32
and I think that they use float 32
default not 64. It's like it's
default not 64. It's like it's
reasonable but I don't know if there's
reasonable but I don't know if there's
anything in there that like needs to be
anything in there that like needs to be
improved. So, I'm not 100% on just using
improved. So, I'm not 100% on just using
the ray botmath. I would be equally
the ray botmath. I would be equally
happy uh just making our own like
happy uh just making our own like
standalone quitterians.h or whatever. Uh
standalone quitterians.h or whatever. Uh
if that's the way we want to go like
if that's the way we want to go like
basically just take yours and add a
basically just take yours and add a
couple extra functions and we could just
couple extra functions and we could just
be good there. The only thing is we
be good there. The only thing is we
would have to output we'd have to have
would have to output we'd have to have
like something to output this ray
like something to output this ray
transform. I think that's like the
transform. I think that's like the
easiest way to draw it. It shouldn't be
easiest way to draw it. It shouldn't be
that hard. It's just
that hard. It's just
like this is just like a super basic
like this is just like a super basic
data structure if you check the source
data structure if you check the source
for it, right? And then
for it, right? And then
yeah, let's go. Let's go run this and
yeah, let's go. Let's go run this and
see what we what we can do here.
Super solid N. This is like I don't
Super solid N. This is like I don't

Well, I think even when we we first

wrote drone and puffer like back the
wrote drone and puffer like back the

original iteration, I think we went from
about 2,000 to a million steps per
about 2,000 to a million steps per
second or something like that was
second or something like that was
ridiculous. And I've sort of I've worked
ridiculous. And I've sort of I've worked
on making it easier and easier. And then
on making it easier and easier. And then
like this environment when I made this,
like this environment when I made this,
this was one of the first things I did
this was one of the first things I did
after graduating. It just didn't it just
after graduating. It just didn't it just
didn't train well at all. And then kind
didn't train well at all. And then kind
of just like over the course of making
of just like over the course of making
the algorithm better and better and all
the algorithm better and better and all
the improvements we've made, this is
the improvements we've made, this is
just like a slightly bit bigger model
just like a slightly bit bigger model

realize it. Um, but it's also like I
suspect that the observations could be
suspect that the observations could be
structured way better than they are

right now. So,
like yeah, this thing is very quickly
like yeah, this thing is very quickly
going to be
going to be

Mhm. Let me try something here because

Actually, here we'll get a baseline

Well, you have two. All right, I'm going
Well, you have two. All right, I'm going
to teach you something here. So,
to teach you something here. So,
you know how
you know how
did anybody ever tell you about like
did anybody ever tell you about like
local minima in a deep learning?
local minima in a deep learning?
Yeah. Okay. Now, did anybody ever tell
Yeah. Okay. Now, did anybody ever tell
you that that's a lie?
you that that's a lie?
Uh, no. Okay. So, there's this whole
Uh, no. Okay. So, there's this whole
kurfuffle here. So, we'll give you a
kurfuffle here. So, we'll give you a
history lesson. Old man Suarez will give
history lesson. Old man Suarez will give
you a history lesson. So, and around
you a history lesson. So, and around
like 2015, there was this whole
like 2015, there was this whole
kurfuffle where like people were just
kurfuffle where like people were just
like worried their optimizers just
like worried their optimizers just
weren't working or whatever, right? And
weren't working or whatever, right? And
the idea was that, hey, these are
the idea was that, hey, these are
massive non-convex optimization
massive non-convex optimization
landscapes and you're going to hit all
landscapes and you're going to hit all
these local minima. So, there was all
these local minima. So, there was all
this research on that and eventually
this research on that and eventually
there was some fancy paper that came
there was some fancy paper that came
along and said, "Hey, actually local
along and said, "Hey, actually local
minima just don't exist." Um, right? And
minima just don't exist." Um, right? And
the intuition for this is very simple.
the intuition for this is very simple.
If you flip a coin, heads or tails,
If you flip a coin, heads or tails,
every single dimension, you flip a coin,
every single dimension, you flip a coin,
heads or tails. If they all come up
heads or tails. If they all come up

minima,
minima,
right? Because you can go in one
right? Because you can go in one
direction or another. The derivative can
direction or another. The derivative can
be up or it can be down. So they all
be up or it can be down. So they all
have to come up heads. Now, that's not
have to come up heads. Now, that's not
true because that models them as like
true because that models them as like
completely independent, but in practice,
completely independent, but in practice,
it ends up being a good enough
it ends up being a good enough
explanation. So you know you just can't
explanation. So you know you just can't
get local minima because there's always
get local minima because there's always
going to be some direction on which you
going to be some direction on which you
can improve. Now if you go from a
can improve. Now if you go from a
million dimensions down to a relatively
million dimensions down to a relatively
small number of dimensions you get local
small number of dimensions you get local
minima again and you get non-convex
minima again and you get non-convex
optimization. Okay. So this is why in
optimization. Okay. So this is why in
general we don't use dimensions that are
general we don't use dimensions that are
lower than like 128 and we at least use
lower than like 128 and we at least use
neural nets that have more than 2,800
neural nets that have more than 2,800
parameters.

Okay. It might not be that bad because
Okay. It might not be that bad because
like in this case it's like okay
like in this case it's like okay
whatever it's 128 but it's just a
whatever it's 128 but it's just a
two-layer network but now you just don't
two-layer network but now you just don't
have any representation capacity. You
have any representation capacity. You
literally have one hidden layer. All
literally have one hidden layer. All
right. So you can represent one
right. So you can represent one
nonlinearity is worth of
nonlinearity is worth of
interestingness. And technically a
interestingness. And technically a
two-layer neural net can represent
two-layer neural net can represent
anything but only if you make the hidden
anything but only if you make the hidden
dimension exponentially large. So that's
dimension exponentially large. So that's

that's like more What did you just
that's like more What did you just
change? I like looked away for half a
change? I like looked away for half a
second. It was 3 million steps per
second. It was 3 million steps per

second. Uh, so it is I set back now is
eight. So you've got 8,000 total drones
eight. So you've got 8,000 total drones
or 81 8192 total drones. I bumped up the
or 81 8192 total drones. I bumped up the
mini batch size a little bit. Mhm. And
mini batch size a little bit. Mhm. And
it looks like it still solves.
So, we just cut the training time down

they like it looks like pretty dang
they like it looks like pretty dang
reasonable.
I mean, to do this in real life, you'd

That's actually something we were

A look at that. That is solid.
I almost don't want to like put a

I guess. Yeah, we we found the colors
I guess. Yeah, we we found the colors
helped tell the orientation quite well.

I guess you could paint like the top of

it blue and the bottom of it red or
it blue and the bottom of it red or
something.
something.
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. And that
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. And that
would like kind of do it, but like you
would like kind of do it, but like you
still don't get the full
still don't get the full
Yeah. Yours is like pretty nice. I think
Yeah. Yours is like pretty nice. I think
it would probably be good. What we would
it would probably be good. What we would
do is we should have it on a toggle. We
do is we should have it on a toggle. We
should have it like actually be a
should have it like actually be a
quadcopter model, but then if you just
quadcopter model, but then if you just
press shift or whatever, press tab, then
press shift or whatever, press tab, then
uh yeah, it comes up.
I do have a quadcopter model for you,
I do have a quadcopter model for you,
but I don't think it it probably is not
but I don't think it it probably is not
just super trivial to add in. You'd have
just super trivial to add in. You'd have
to
to
maybe it is.
maybe it is.
I don't know. cuz you have to I don't
I don't know. cuz you have to I don't
know how you do the angle cuz the way
know how you do the angle cuz the way
you guys have it now it's just they're
you guys have it now it's just they're
spheres but I can show you the the model
spheres but I can show you the the model
that I have for this.
that I have for this.
Mhm. Yeah, sure.
Mhm. Yeah, sure.
Oh, wait. Did I
Oh, wait. Did I
No, I didn't get a quadcopter model.
No, I didn't get a quadcopter model.
It's like a different drone model. I
It's like a different drone model. I
forgot. So, we would have to get one.
forgot. So, we would have to get one.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz I I went with like
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cuz I I went with like
I got the sci-fi looking model, but we
I got the sci-fi looking model, but we
could easily get one. All right. Okay.
could easily get one. All right. Okay.
Presumably there's loads on like the
Presumably there's loads on like the
Unity asset store and places. Yeah,

there are Turbo Squid everywhere.

Yeah. Yeah. That would be cool. Like the
Yeah. Yeah. That would be cool. Like the
racing ms are just a bunch of rings.
racing ms are just a bunch of rings.
I think it's a little bit complicated
I think it's a little bit complicated
because what you basically you have to

do is you have to generate like

you have to is it like a bezier? You
you have to is it like a bezier? You
have to generate like some sort of like
have to generate like some sort of like
funky curve, right, that you use as the
funky curve, right, that you use as the
track and then you place some rings like
track and then you place some rings like
on that path. Yeah. Yeah. I've worked
on that path. Yeah. Yeah. I've worked
with Bezier curves before so that
with Bezier curves before so that
shouldn't be too bad. Mhm. And then this
shouldn't be too bad. Mhm. And then this
is perfect cuz like that's all the math
is perfect cuz like that's all the math
that I do not want to have to do. Okay.
that I do not want to have to do. Okay.

Did we read this paper? I think we did.
Did we read this paper? I think we did.
But like this stuff works. But like I
But like this stuff works. But like I
bet we could do stuff like this so much
bet we could do stuff like this so much
better and so much more easily now with

a complicated course. We could do way
a complicated course. We could do way
harder stuff than this.
harder stuff than this.
Yeah. These traces are pretty nice.
I'll think about how to do this. I think
I'll think about how to do this. I think

they have a huge turn radius. Yeah.
they have a huge turn radius. Yeah.
Yeah. Imagine if it were just like

right?
right?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Looks fun. Yeah. I'd be awful at that.
Looks fun. Yeah. I'd be awful at that.
We'll stick to the code.
We'll stick to the code.
Okay. Now, for the fun part, let's get
Okay. Now, for the fun part, let's get
this onto the website for you
this onto the website for you
that All right. Now, the one thing is I
that All right. Now, the one thing is I
don't think you did the I don't think
don't think you did the I don't think
you did the C network stuff, right?
you did the C network stuff, right?
Uh, no. All right, I'll show you how to
Uh, no. All right, I'll show you how to
do that real quick. This is cool. I made
do that real quick. This is cool. I made
a thing to make it easy.
a thing to make it easy.
Cool.
Will it be on um like the the live
Will it be on um like the the live
website today or will it be when Puffer
website today or will it be when Puffer
Free releases? When releases. Right.
Free releases? When releases. Right.
Okay. Oh, and I'll need uh I'll have to
Okay. Oh, and I'll need uh I'll have to
get both of you. We'll add both of you
get both of you. We'll add both of you
to the uh the contributors section of
to the uh the contributors section of
that right now as well so that I don't
that right now as well so that I don't
forget to do it. Okay, cool.
forget to do it. Okay, cool.
What you do is you load in load in
What you do is you load in load in
weights like this.
Spencer, uh hey. Yeah, I'm on with the
Spencer, uh hey. Yeah, I'm on with the
drone guys in Discord now. Dude, they
drone guys in Discord now. Dude, they
did awesome work on this. Like, we
did awesome work on this. Like, we
should actually chat about what we can
should actually chat about what we can
do with industry stuff. Like, this is
do with industry stuff. Like, this is
freaking cool.
Well, it's like it's like four months
Well, it's like it's like four months
now before we're back with uni work. So,
now before we're back with uni work. So,
we're we're happy happy for whatever.
we're we're happy happy for whatever.
Let's get stuff.
Let's get stuff.
Let's get some stuff going fast. Let me
Let's get some stuff going fast. Let me
just show Let me just show you this real
just show Let me just show you this real
quick, Spencer. Like, look at this
quick, Spencer. Like, look at this
thing. Look at how cool the dynamics of
thing. Look at how cool the dynamics of
this thing are.
Like, that actually looks like how a
Like, that actually looks like how a
drone would move.
Unlike my sim where I have like tons of
Unlike my sim where I have like tons of
agents and it looks cool, but the
agents and it looks cool, but the
physics are jank as hell.
And the code for it is super clean, too.
All right. So, let me show you how this
All right. So, let me show you how this
works. So what you do
works. So what you do
huffer export
huffer export
hopper drone.
So all this does is this just takes the
So all this does is this just takes the
weights out of the pietorch network in
weights out of the pietorch network in
the order that they are listed and then
the order that they are listed and then
writes them to a binary file just like
writes them to a binary file just like
numpy saves them and that format is
numpy saves them and that format is
literally just like you know uh four
literally just like you know uh four
bytes for first weight float four bytes
bytes for first weight float four bytes
for second that's all it is. Mhm. Okay.
for second that's all it is. Mhm. Okay.
So what we do is we get this number
So what we do is we get this number
which is the total number of weights
which is the total number of weights
saved.
saved.
We uh we put this into here and this
We uh we put this into here and this
will work for you know whatever n uh
will work for you know whatever n uh
so now we just we need to know
so now we just we need to know
I didn't do continuous ah I didn't
I didn't do continuous ah I didn't
do continuous action sampling though. Oh
do continuous action sampling though. Oh
I'm I'm going to try to I'm going to try
I'm I'm going to try to I'm going to try
to hack it. But yeah I didn't do
to hack it. But yeah I didn't do
continuous action sampling in uh in
continuous action sampling in uh in
this. So, the thing that I wanted to
this. So, the thing that I wanted to
show you though that's really cool,
show you though that's really cool,
right? Um,
right? Um,
the thing I wanted to show you that's
the thing I wanted to show you that's
really cool is basically this thing.
really cool is basically this thing.
This is pufferet.

This is
This is
I don't know if I've mentioned but I
I don't know if I've mentioned but I
might have. Is this PyTorch and C? Yes,
might have. Is this PyTorch and C? Yes,
this is PyTorch and Pure C. Yeah. So we
this is PyTorch and Pure C. Yeah. So we
have a 700 line file that has some

that it's written in PyTorch and tested.
that it's written in PyTorch and tested.
So what you can do is you can take your
So what you can do is you can take your
PyTorch weights, you can load them in,
PyTorch weights, you can load them in,
you do it in C, you compile the web
you do it in C, you compile the web
assembly and then for small networks

they just run in your browser. Yeah,
they just run in your browser. Yeah,
that's very nice. Which is like if you
that's very nice. Which is like if you
tried to run stuff and compile for your
tried to run stuff and compile for your
browser before, it's a total nightmare.
browser before, it's a total nightmare.
So this was the easy way of doing it.
All right.
Slightly annoying.
What I'll do is I'll just do like this.
Custom. We'll custom it.
It's not that bad. There's only this
It's not that bad. There's only this
amount of code.

Now this should load this in. We need to

know the ob size of 16. Is it 16? Yes.

I believe that the way I should do this

is I should do this as

Yep.
Yep.
um is
um is
if I were to guess,
I would think
And then I just write

Yes.
I think it's going to be like this. Not

you output the mean.

Yeah,
I would think that that would work

we fixed that error, I got to shift the

Oh, yeah.
Ah, there we go. Nice.
It's not exact, right? It's not exactly

Maybe it's Do you think Do we think it's

and then
that we have to
Okay. So,
Okay. So,
uh let's try to make sure that this is

Cool. Cool.
That's a pain. I know.
That's a pain. I know.
Wait a guess.
I know this was like one of the first
I know this was like one of the first
things I did on buffer because it like

it let me run p your end to end on the
it let me run p your end to end on the

web and then that's kind of when I
started committing to doing all this
started committing to doing all this
stuff in C
because it like makes a big difference
because it like makes a big difference
when you can actually talk through demos

Okay. Okay. So this is the same as

Mhm.
Yeah, we found that quite a lot with the

So I had to hack a couple things for you

So we can put this on the website just
So we can put this on the website just
like that.
Get rid of total steps.
Uh we also do need to get rid of uh
Uh we also do need to get rid of uh
these prints.
All right. So now the the magic here is

literally just change this from fast to

And then um
single generator

see
this copy all that stuff. Uh, we do we
this copy all that stuff. Uh, we do we
get a thumbnail.
That
That
cool.
And then all I have to do is add you

All I have to do is add you a template.
You put drone.

Let's see. Right at the top, surely.
Let's see. Right at the top, surely.
Not too far from it.
We'll do right after the really big

Okay, so
Okay, so
two things we got to do. One is check

immediately just on the website. Nice.
It looks slower. Is that It does look
It looks slower. Is that It does look
slower, doesn't it?
Can't possibly be from lag.
See how you have it and see
not window close.
You have target FPS set to
I can't imagine that this would be
I can't imagine that this would be
low.
Is anything trading at the minute or
Is anything trading at the minute or
shouldn't be?
shouldn't be?
You check the other Ms.
Yeah. All that. Oh, but the drone itself
Yeah. All that. Oh, but the drone itself
is Is there anything based on time?
is Is there anything based on time?
Um, I don't think so. Not Not really.
Um, I don't think so. Not Not really.
No, nothing based on frame cuz like look
No, nothing based on frame cuz like look
at this. This seems to be moving.
at this. This seems to be moving.
Like these stats seem to be updating at
Like these stats seem to be updating at
a reasonable rate. Yeah.
Okay. That's a little thing. I do get
Okay. That's a little thing. I do get
some lag on this end, but I get lag on
some lag on this end, but I get lag on
this end because I have a thousand

should be the the network

could be, but your net is pretty small.
could be, but your net is pretty small.
Yeah, I guess I mean this is so this is
Yeah, I guess I mean this is so this is
the same network basically but I trained
the same network basically but I trained
for you guys but running a thousand

Oh,
Oh,
it's not lag. Yeah, it's there's
it's not lag. Yeah, it's there's
something with mcripting, right?
You know, it might be something with
You know, it might be something with
like these continuous ends where like I
like these continuous ends where like I
think your browser kind of just decides
think your browser kind of just decides
to render stuff whenever. There might
to render stuff whenever. There might
have to be some sort of interpolation,
have to be some sort of interpolation,
right?
Bit of a bummer. It's it's slower on
Bit of a bummer. It's it's slower on
here. Let me think what how we can hack
here. Let me think what how we can hack
this.
native.
All right, let me get you onto the site
All right, let me get you onto the site
first and then out because there's also
first and then out because there's also
you also get to go on this page.
Go right.
I'll reverse it. I'll do it one order
I'll reverse it. I'll do it one order
one way and the other the other. That's
one way and the other the other. That's
chill. Yeah, that's good. Nice.
Awesome.
Rocket Lander was No, Rocket Lander was
Rocket Lander was No, Rocket Lander was
me attempting to hack on it and then
me attempting to hack on it and then
Kyle attempt Morganstein attempted to do
Kyle attempt Morganstein attempted to do
stuff and nobody finished it. Can you
stuff and nobody finished it. Can you
show dronec again? Yeah, Adrian. Uh,
show dronec again? Yeah, Adrian. Uh,
it's just in a while window not window
it's just in a while window not window
should close loop.
should close loop.
Why is it a linear cont?
Why is it a linear cont?
Because it has continuous action. So, I
Because it has continuous action. So, I
had to hack them a continuous action

Do you think this thing is slow?
Do you think this thing is slow?
It shouldn't be, right? No, there's no
It shouldn't be, right? No, there's no
way this is slow.
Just a random. It doesn't look like it.
Definitely faster here. Much faster.
easiest.
easiest.
Oh, easiest fix for this. Hang on.
I just build it half a faster FPS. See
I just build it half a faster FPS. See
if it like
if it like
120 didn't fix it for me. Did you try
120 didn't fix it for me. Did you try
this?
I've tried everything that you'll think
I've tried everything that you'll think
of in the next few hours. Lovely.
of in the next few hours. Lovely.
Great.
It's weird because we definitely we have
It's weird because we definitely we have
ends where it's not a problem.
The whole web ecosystem is kind of just
The whole web ecosystem is kind of just
broken. Uh web web people don't actually
broken. Uh web web people don't actually
know how to write code. Turns out I mean
know how to write code. Turns out I mean
you can just look at React and say
you can just look at React and say
really these people know how to write
really these people know how to write
code? No, they don't.
So 120 doesn't seem to fix it at all.
So 120 doesn't seem to fix it at all.
Right.
Right.
It's just it's just frame rate capped it
It's just it's just frame rate capped it
looks like.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Banner.
Banner.
All right. So,
All right. So,
um, band-aid patch
for speed.
What are you looking for? Actually, here
What are you looking for? Actually, here
what we can do is
I know what we're going to do to fix
I know what we're going to do to fix
this.

Okay,
assuming the rendering is slow, we'll
assuming the rendering is slow, we'll
just down sample the rendering to 30
just down sample the rendering to 30
while keeping the internals the same.
while keeping the internals the same.
Mhm.
size issue. You mean a size issue?
size issue. You mean a size issue?
So, that's super fast when I do it
So, that's super fast when I do it
locally, but
I don't know if it actually I don't know
I don't know if it actually I don't know
if it's actually reloaded to this thing.
if it's actually reloaded to this thing.
We'd have to do something to test if
We'd have to do something to test if
it's actually been reloaded. Right.
Let's crank it like way the heck up.
Let's crank it like way the heck up.
Mhm.
like sometimes it just cashes.
Uh, and actually hang on.
Ah, see that's what I was afraid of.
Okay.
So that is the uh
So that is the uh
the ridiculous down sampled one. Yeah.
Can't tell if that's any faster.
Can't tell if that's any faster.
Yeah.
Does seem slower, right? Yeah,
Does seem slower, right? Yeah,
definitely.
So, I know that you can get this type of
So, I know that you can get this type of
stuff if you don't have put this in a Y
stuff if you don't have put this in a Y
loop or whatever. You can screw it up.
loop or whatever. You can screw it up.
Um, but the way it's supposed to work is
Um, but the way it's supposed to work is
that the only difference with web versus
that the only difference with web versus
uh local your browser kind of just
uh local your browser kind of just
decides when it's going to give you
decides when it's going to give you
compute time. Um,
compute time. Um,
think that there should be anything
think that there should be anything
super heavy though this end flag at all.
super heavy though this end flag at all.
I mean, there's definitely a performance
I mean, there's definitely a performance
factor gap between um like web and
factor gap between um like web and
normal, but like I if I do I should be
normal, but like I if I do I should be
able to do your end at like 600 FPS
able to do your end at like 600 FPS
locally, no problem.
See if this
See if this
Yeah. So, this is this is fast drone.
Yeah. So, this is this is fast drone.
Yeah.
This is like the type of this is the
This is like the type of this is the
type of drone that we would like to
type of drone that we would like to
create.
create.
Right. This is the type of drone we
Right. This is the type of drone we
would like to create.
I mean that's like Yeah.
Oh, I wonder if it's this thing.
trying to fix this for you because it's
trying to fix this for you because it's
like it's such a length.
like it's such a length.
Yeah, it be nice if it's if it's full
Yeah, it be nice if it's if it's full
speed.
So
So
yeah.
Okay. Another thing
me data.
Yeah. I'm trying to think what it would
Yeah. I'm trying to think what it would
be that they have right like
Don't believe this is window ready for
Don't believe this is window ready for
sure
your code in for no reason.
It's weird because I don't actually see
It's weird because I don't actually see
this on my ends like except for the uh
this on my ends like except for the uh
the ones where it's obviously going to
the ones where it's obviously going to
lag because the net is too slow.
lag because the net is too slow.
Do we think it's text?
Do we think it's text?
It very well could be. Like it could be
It very well could be. Like it could be
that the mcript and like the text is
that the mcript and like the text is
just different.
just different.
You made some changes to Terraform C
You made some changes to Terraform C
dynamics to not be so aggressive. No, I
dynamics to not be so aggressive. No, I
made changes to uh the controls in the C
made changes to uh the controls in the C
so that it would not I made changes to
so that it would not I made changes to
the controls and the uh the way that
the controls and the uh the way that
actions are gotten from your presses. So
actions are gotten from your presses. So
it doesn't set you to like the max Excel
it doesn't set you to like the max Excel
instantly. I should not have changed the
instantly. I should not have changed the
C dynamics.
No, it is not pushed. But it should not
No, it is not pushed. But it should not
change your policy.
Okay. So this is the normal speed,
Okay. So this is the normal speed,
right?
right?
Yep.
Of course, there's one memory. My fault.
Still slow, isn't it?
Still slow, isn't it?
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Like maddening.
Have a sleep or something? You don't
Have a sleep or something? You don't
have like a sleep call anywhere?
have like a sleep call anywhere?
No. Okay.
No. Okay.
Got to love mcripton.
See rail mcript
See rail mcript
didn't render slow.
This is uh
This is uh
ridiculous.
Really good.
Really good.
M script in bad. Ray good.
Actually, I think Rayb's the best piece
Actually, I think Rayb's the best piece
of software I've ever worked with.
of software I've ever worked with.
Mhm.
Mhm.
really good
brave. Why would I do that?
Got to work on Chrome.
I'm trying to think if there's any any
I'm trying to think if there's any any
calls that I see in here that I don't
calls that I see in here that I don't
use in my
use in my
my end.
my end.
You don't have any trace logs here that
You don't have any trace logs here that
like aren't on error paths. Yeah.
like aren't on error paths. Yeah.
Uh, I think so. Yeah.
Uh, I think so. Yeah.
They're just for errors from slower than
They're just for errors from slower than
brave. Yeah. But it shouldn't matter.
brave. Yeah. But it shouldn't matter.
This thing should render 600 FPS if we
This thing should render 600 FPS if we
want it to.
Make
Okay. So, the way you did it is
Okay. So, the way you did it is
technically fine.
technically fine.
because you make
because you make
this.
This is actually all redundant, funny
This is actually all redundant, funny
enough.
enough.
Literally just delete that.
Provided you do this,
we'll make it on the first reset.
Okay.
Okay.
How do I make your thing fast?
Trying to figure out here.
I mean the most likely thing I can think
I mean the most likely thing I can think
of because like it still looked slow
of because like it still looked slow
even when we did um this like tick down
even when we did um this like tick down
sampling right like even if I did this
sampling right like even if I did this
like here if I do this locally this
like here if I do this locally this
should be zoom in right
should be zoom in right
that's like not even
that's like not even
yeah that should just be zooming but
yeah that should just be zooming but
then if I do this on web
If this is slow, what this implies is
If this is slow, what this implies is
that the actual environment code itself
that the actual environment code itself
is running too slowly to keep up. Right?
is running too slowly to keep up. Right?
So look at this. The actual environment
So look at this. The actual environment
code itself is running too slowly to
code itself is running too slowly to
keep up. So basically that means that
keep up. So basically that means that
something is compiling just garbage on
something is compiling just garbage on
web specifically for some dumb reason.
web specifically for some dumb reason.
Right. Awesome.
Right. Awesome.
which is I know really really fun to
which is I know really really fun to
figure out.
Got one more idea and then I got to
Got one more idea and then I got to
figure out meeting. Um yeah,
it's kind of reaching a bit but
it's kind of reaching a bit but
sometimes generated like a massive build
sometimes generated like a massive build
or something.
Yeah. No, it's the
Yeah. No, it's the
end of dynamics themselves somehow
end of dynamics themselves somehow
are not being called um frequently
are not being called um frequently
enough,
right? Super weird. Like you see, and
right? Super weird. Like you see, and
it's it's weird because like your end
it's it's weird because like your end
run super fast.
run super fast.
Yeah.
This there's like no memor allocation
This there's like no memor allocation
for your own paternian logic which is
for your own paternian logic which is
fine.
fine.
Not a single thing in here. weird.
Not a single thing in here. weird.
That's just rough.
It's implied that it is the
It's implied that it is the
step function.
step function.
Mhm.
Could it be all the the the runiffs, the
Could it be all the the the runiffs, the
random floats?
random floats?
I don't see why it would be. But
I don't see why it would be. But
what? Like you think it doesn't handle
what? Like you think it doesn't handle
inline keyword correctly or something?
inline keyword correctly or something?
That didn't.
That didn't.
We'll try it real quick.
We'll try it real quick.
This is what we'll do.
Static find

do anything. That's weird.

There is I have been getting these WebGL
There is I have been getting these WebGL
errors lately.
errors lately.
I wonder if there is some weird thing
I wonder if there is some weird thing
happening.
happening.
Yeah. Um
Yeah. Um
base RIB installed though. That's super
base RIB installed though. That's super
obnoxious.
obnoxious.
I mean, we can technically solve it just
I mean, we can technically solve it just
by jacking up this of this a little bit.
by jacking up this of this a little bit.
Retrain with that.
Retrain with that.
Um I will leave it to you to figure out
Um I will leave it to you to figure out
what how you'd like me to deal with
what how you'd like me to deal with
this. The the source thing I we'll
this. The the source thing I we'll
figure it out eventually. It's just like
figure it out eventually. It's just like
I don't know what the heck is wrong with
I don't know what the heck is wrong with
it,
it,
right? Yeah, fair enough. We can have a
right? Yeah, fair enough. We can have a
look at it tomorrow at some point. Yeah,
I've kind of shown you the whole
I've kind of shown you the whole
process. Why does this pop?
process. Why does this pop?
Uh why why are we not
uh did I do something dumb?
Why do not work?
How did I break your ends?
I'm confused.
Come on. How did I How did I do that?
Come on. How did I How did I do that?
I didn't change anything, did I? I What
I didn't change anything, did I? I What
was the last thing I even did?
Oh.
Oh.
Uh, I somehow undid this change. Oh,
Uh, I somehow undid this change. Oh,
okay. Okay, we're good. So, this it
okay. Okay, we're good. So, this it
still runs at least.
still runs at least.
Okay, let's get this onto the
Okay, let's get this onto the
get these fixes into this. So because I
get these fixes into this. So because I
added this end and I didn't commit
Nice. Okay. So, yeah, here it is on the
Nice. Okay. So, yeah, here it is on the
site. Go to the homepage

listed there.
listed there.
Awesome. All the uh the contributors.
Awesome. All the uh the contributors.
It's quite a list at this point. And
It's quite a list at this point. And
then we'll have full here for now.
then we'll have full here for now.
Figure out some fun ways to jazz this
Figure out some fun ways to jazz this
up. Maybe it's just the quad quadcopter
up. Maybe it's just the quad quadcopter
or whatever. Yeah. Um and yeah, there
or whatever. Yeah. Um and yeah, there
will be much more much more drone stuff
will be much more much more drone stuff
going forward. So I think we'll
going forward. So I think we'll
you guys are free to play around with
you guys are free to play around with
multi-agent if you want. Um it really
multi-agent if you want. Um it really
would not be hard at all to do. Um, I
would not be hard at all to do. Um, I
mean you could literally retrofit
mean you could literally retrofit
either the physics of your end to any of
either the physics of your end to any of
our MS or our multi- aent into any of
our MS or our multi- aent into any of
yours. Uh, there is so if you go find
yours. Uh, there is so if you go find
this HTML, it's in the puffer.ai repo
this HTML, it's in the puffer.ai repo
under the dev branch. It's just ocean
under the dev branch. It's just ocean
html. So there these docs are way better
html. So there these docs are way better
than what's on 20. Um, okay. And it has
than what's on 20. Um, okay. And it has
like definitely have a look at that. It
like definitely have a look at that. It
has this this ray li style cheat sheet
has this this ray li style cheat sheet
and then it has examples. But then the
and then it has examples. But then the
main thing is it has this little guide
main thing is it has this little guide
on writing M which you probably know
on writing M which you probably know
most of it's got these checks but uh it
most of it's got these checks but uh it
takes you through basically
takes you through basically
the reference end which is target. I
the reference end which is target. I
built this thing as a commented
built this thing as a commented
example to make it really easy to build
example to make it really easy to build
multi stuff. So this is like a trains in
multi stuff. So this is like a trains in
30 seconds simple as possible multi-
30 seconds simple as possible multi-
aent fun and
aent fun and
um and like the dynamics of this
um and like the dynamics of this
basically you add like 50 lines or maybe
basically you add like 50 lines or maybe
100 lines max to this and you get this
great
great
take a look at that. Thanks guys. I will
take a look at that. Thanks guys. I will
get to meeting this is an awesome end
get to meeting this is an awesome end
and I look forward to doing more drone
and I look forward to doing more drone
stuff with y'all. Amazing. Awesome.
stuff with y'all. Amazing. Awesome.
Thank you so much, Joseph. Bye. Thank
