I would have just done that earlier but

you never know until you actually get

into it bug fix request add a flush to

vm. Clos is it really that simple that
vm. Clos is it really that simple that
guy if it's that simple I'll do it right
guy if it's that simple I'll do it right
now
do we even have a flush function
still where was this
thing wait for them to close and then
thing wait for them to close and then
call terminate
okay so we do this oh multi I'm my bad
okay so we do this oh multi I'm my bad
see not back to
100% you can't call
100% you can't call
[Music]
closed do we even have a flu
sending Clos and waiting for
it okay let me see if we have
that you have a close
message closing
message closing
worker some pipe sent none
oh I so I remember the reason that I
oh I so I remember the reason that I
didn't do this it's because yeah it's
didn't do this it's because yeah it's
fine I will add it but it's going to
fine I will add it but it's going to
take more testing before I can push it
take more testing before I can push it
uh which is fine we can do that uh
uh which is fine we can do that uh
either today depending on how many you
either today depending on how many you
know different things we have we're
know different things we have we're
going forward um let me just
going forward um let me just
say so we do msf
say so we do msf
close pipe
close pipe
none break
none break
and
and
then you have to set the semaphor no to
main well we would like to improve
that so we just do self Dot
that so we just do self Dot
where is
it
receive I actually don't know if this is
receive I actually don't know if this is
the right thing though because
the right thing though because
technically look I can do
technically look I can do
this have you thought through like how
this have you thought through like how
this has to
this has to
look cuz I can do this
right but this actually this could be
right but this actually this could be
this can happen at a wrong time so I
this can happen at a wrong time so I
think that you need to receive
think that you need to receive
everything
first yeah there isn't like a flush
first yeah there isn't like a flush
function though so I'm
actually I assume by the fact that like
actually I assume by the fact that like
you're asking me to do this you don't
you're asking me to do this you don't
want to have to think about this in PR
want to have to think about this in PR
it
right uh
worker as usually what that
means or or less yeah I got you
it's going to be something like this
it's going to be something like this
right so you wait for all of
right so you wait for all of
them and then you call
close I don't know if you did
[Music]
close
do I think that's it
don't you have to do this
don't you have to do this
Shenanigans I think it's something like
this check for in
this check for in
progress info
messages in progress
do
I you know the
reason you might have to okay we'll
reason you might have to okay we'll
discuss
discuss
that
that
uh let me see
if Sam is
info yeah I actually don't remember what
info yeah I actually don't remember what
this was man
I haven't looked at this in a while
and we'll send a
message so if info you need the ACT to
receive why does everything not just
receive why does everything not just
infinitely Loop
infinitely Loop
then because we do use infos right
right no one calls ASN
right no one calls ASN
said oh
okay well whatever I just did makes the
okay well whatever I just did makes the
thing hang so this isn't
good I don't know if it's an edge case
good I don't know if it's an edge case
or API abuse to be
honest maybe both
honest maybe both
okay so this doesn't freaking
work is there a
work is there a
difference yeah the distinctions

whatever I say the distinction is justes
whatever I say the distinction is justes

just like all right screw it I'm not
doing
anything I also didn't realize that I
anything I also didn't realize that I
just literally forgotten to ship the new
just literally forgotten to ship the new
container version I thought it was going
container version I thought it was going
to be a more involved process otherwise
to be a more involved process otherwise
I would have just done that earlier but
I would have just done that earlier but
you never know until you actually get
you never know until you actually get
into it bug fix request add a flush to
into it bug fix request add a flush to
vm. Clos is it really that simple that
vm. Clos is it really that simple that
guy if it's that simple I'll do it right
guy if it's that simple I'll do it right
now
do we even have a flush function
still where was this
thing wait for them to close and then
thing wait for them to close and then
call terminate
okay so we do this oh multi I'm my bad
okay so we do this oh multi I'm my bad
see not back to
100% you can't call
100% you can't call
[Music]
closed do we even have a flu
sending Clos and waiting for
it okay let me see if we have
that you have a close
message closing
message closing
worker some pipe sent none
oh I so I remember the reason that I
oh I so I remember the reason that I
didn't do this it's because yeah it's
didn't do this it's because yeah it's
fine I will add it but it's going to
fine I will add it but it's going to
take more testing before I can push it
take more testing before I can push it
uh which is fine we can do that uh
uh which is fine we can do that uh
either today depending on how many you
either today depending on how many you
know different things we have we're
know different things we have we're
going forward um let me just
going forward um let me just
say so we do msf
say so we do msf
close pipe
close pipe
none break
none break
and
and
then you have to set the semaphor no to
main well we would like to improve
that so we just do self Dot
that so we just do self Dot
where is
it
receive I actually don't know if this is
receive I actually don't know if this is
the right thing though because
the right thing though because
technically look I can do
technically look I can do
this have you thought through like how
this have you thought through like how
this has to
this has to
look cuz I can do this
right but this actually this could be
right but this actually this could be
this can happen at a wrong time so I
this can happen at a wrong time so I
think that you need to receive
think that you need to receive
everything
first yeah there isn't like a flush
first yeah there isn't like a flush
function though so I'm
actually I assume by the fact that like
actually I assume by the fact that like
you're asking me to do this you don't
you're asking me to do this you don't
want to have to think about this in PR
want to have to think about this in PR
it
right uh
worker as usually what that
means or or less yeah I got you
it's going to be something like this
it's going to be something like this
right so you wait for all of
right so you wait for all of
them and then you call
close I don't know if you did
[Music]
close
do I think that's it
don't you have to do this
don't you have to do this
Shenanigans I think it's something like
this check for in
this check for in
progress info
messages in progress
do
I you know the
reason you might have to okay we'll
reason you might have to okay we'll
discuss
discuss
that
that
uh let me see
if Sam is
info yeah I actually don't remember what
info yeah I actually don't remember what
this was man
I haven't looked at this in a while
and we'll send a
message so if info you need the ACT to
receive why does everything not just
receive why does everything not just
infinitely Loop
infinitely Loop
then because we do use infos right
right no one calls ASN
right no one calls ASN
said oh
okay well whatever I just did makes the
okay well whatever I just did makes the
thing hang so this isn't
good I don't know if it's an edge case
good I don't know if it's an edge case
or API abuse to be
honest maybe both
honest maybe both
okay so this doesn't freaking
work is there a
work is there a
difference yeah the distinctions
difference yeah the distinctions
whatever I say the distinction is justes
whatever I say the distinction is justes
puffer Li work with python
3.12 just you tells uh it might work I
3.12 just you tells uh it might work I
have not tested it generally I have
have not tested it generally I have
tested the version that is on our
tested the version that is on our
container
it should work though in uh
it should work though in uh
3.12 so I'd like to figure that
out let's just make a
little

version uh was it a what is it uh and
version uh was it a what is it uh and
close and
then didn't add extra receive for infos
then didn't add extra receive for infos
in your
close
where where should I add
this just to both of
them is this one as
well no cuz this one's just got the
well no cuz this one's just got the
clothes
right okay still broken so we'll take
right okay still broken so we'll take
some more work um it's about noon so I I
some more work um it's about noon so I I
will fix this I don't I don't want to
will fix this I don't I don't want to
break all our V but this will actually
break all our V but this will actually
get this will actually get merged and
get this will actually get merged and
you'll get a a pit package update for
you'll get a a pit package update for
this when I fix it that guy um so
