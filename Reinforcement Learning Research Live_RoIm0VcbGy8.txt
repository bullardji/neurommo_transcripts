we are back live.
we are back live.
Good morning folks.
We have a few things to do today. Um,
We have a few things to do today. Um,
as I kind of said yesterday,
as I kind of said yesterday,
really not doing like a huge amount of
really not doing like a huge amount of
stuff this.
stuff this.
We're kind of just doing post-release
We're kind of just doing post-release
stuff. We're doing a few posts on uh
stuff. We're doing a few posts on uh
Twitter and everywhere else. Making sure
Twitter and everywhere else. Making sure
that people actually see our release.
that people actually see our release.
We're fixing up some things that I
We're fixing up some things that I
haven't had time to fix for people who
haven't had time to fix for people who
are uh involved with and using Puffer
are uh involved with and using Puffer
Lib, let's say. trying to fix up some
Lib, let's say. trying to fix up some
things with the meta environment. I told
things with the meta environment. I told
Stone I'd do some robotic stuff. Just
Stone I'd do some robotic stuff. Just
know a few little things here and there.
know a few little things here and there.
Um,
Um,
and then, you know, sometime in the next
and then, you know, sometime in the next
couple weeks, we're going to really
couple weeks, we're going to really
start on the new stuff with drones and
start on the new stuff with drones and
more industry side.
more industry side.
They're having some meetings with
They're having some meetings with
various bases off the uh off the stream

looking for problems we can solve with

uh RL going forward.
uh RL going forward.
Pop out the chat real quick and then
Pop out the chat real quick and then
I'll this over to the green view
moment
and I think what we're going to do on
and I think what we're going to do on
I got a meeting in like an hour, no two
I got a meeting in like an hour, no two
hours.
hours.
So that's good. Um,
So that's good. Um,
what we're going to do in the meantime,
what we're going to do in the meantime,
we're going to see if we can figure out
we're going to see if we can figure out
this meta environment and what's going
this meta environment and what's going
on with it.
I would love to know why it's this slow.
Can I figure out why it's this slow?
Can I figure out why it's this slow?
Actually,
Actually,
maybe I can just figure out
Yeah, let's do like test
Yeah, let's do like test
at uh
down here.
Move all this crap out of the way.
Okay. So, does this work?
Okay. So, does this work?
If so, we can run profiler on it.
does work.
Do I have um profile in here?
This is a torch profile which is not
there way we can get profiling into C
there way we can get profiling into C
from Python
from Python
when it's like an external thing that we
when it's like an external thing that we
don't have control over
or am I going to have to set up like uh
or am I going to have to set up like uh
level profiling?
Tricky with the way that they've
Tricky with the way that they've
developed this specific environment.
I think I know how to do it though.
this thing All right.
So, pretty much what I'm trying to do
So, pretty much what I'm trying to do
here is I'm just trying to figure out
here is I'm just trying to figure out
why this end is so slow. Um, so I can at
why this end is so slow. Um, so I can at
least have some idea of how to set up
least have some idea of how to set up
efficient experiments on it.
efficient experiments on it.
It might just be that it's just slow
It might just be that it's just slow
overall, but I'm hoping that they're
overall, but I'm hoping that they're
going to be like some combination of
going to be like some combination of
settings that are at least bearable. Uh,
settings that are at least bearable. Uh,
we're going to eventually have to
we're going to eventually have to
rewrite some sections, I think, of it or
rewrite some sections, I think, of it or
reoptimize some sections, at least help
reoptimize some sections, at least help
the authors do that. But in the
the authors do that. But in the
meantime, just looking for something
meantime, just looking for something
quick.
Oh, okay. So, we actually do get
Oh, okay. So, we actually do get
This is way too big, though.
See what this does.
See what this does.
Oops. All right. One second. Apparently,
Oops. All right. One second. Apparently,
I have countertops being installed right
I have countertops being installed right
now. I'll be right back.
I'll have to monitor that, but
I'll have to monitor that, but
otherwise good to do a little bit of
otherwise good to do a little bit of
work for a
I figure out why this
backwards
by
Oh, I just had to add dump.
Literally just that.
Okay.
Okay.
So from this
So from this
we can see the problem
we can see the problem
and I checked
Probably the replay riders probably
Probably the replay riders probably
filling up my whole disc space as well.
That's what was happening.
And now we have
And now we have
most of the time is coming from samples.
Good.
Now, this is probably going to tell us a
Now, this is probably going to tell us a
very different story, right?
very different story, right?
Yeah, very different story.
Yeah, very different story.
That's 680k.
And that's actually as about as fast as
And that's actually as about as fast as
we should expect it to go anyways,
we should expect it to go anyways,
right? Yeah. Let's just let that train.
right? Yeah. Let's just let that train.
And actually, we'll we'll log that
And actually, we'll we'll log that
on Neptune.
on Neptune.
And I'll tag it
token.
Good.
Good.
Go check on the counters.
I have had a uh a piece of plywood for
I have had a uh a piece of plywood for
the kitchen counter for the last couple
the kitchen counter for the last couple
of months. This uh building is not fully
of months. This uh building is not fully
finished, so that's nice.
finished, so that's nice.
All right. What's going on here? This
All right. What's going on here? This
This thing does not appear to be
This thing does not appear to be
training like at all, right?
Yeah. So,
let me see what we put in the config for
let me see what we put in the config for
this.
Actually,
Actually,
maybe we should just try to run this
maybe we should just try to run this
thing.
So, this is finishing eval. And once
So, this is finishing eval. And once
this is done with Eval, we're going to
this is done with Eval, we're going to
actually now finally, and this is why
actually now finally, and this is why
it's taken me so long to actually even
it's taken me so long to actually even
do anything with this end. We didn't
do anything with this end. We didn't
have the replay viewer working. At least
have the replay viewer working. At least
now we'll be able to see what it is this
now we'll be able to see what it is this
policy is doing and whether it makes any
policy is doing and whether it makes any
sense, whether the environment is a
sense, whether the environment is a
problem or what.
That ought to give us a couple replays.
That ought to give us a couple replays.
Give it a minute to run.
The hope is that today we'll actually be
The hope is that today we'll actually be
able to get some
able to get some
at least some sort of reasonable policy.
at least some sort of reasonable policy.
Got you two articles. What you think we
Got you two articles. What you think we
should post first?
should post first?
Terraform.
Uh I just did
Uh I just did
two technical articles.
Don't think
Don't think
we can try. Let's see if we try this
we can try. Let's see if we try this
one.
one.
See,
uh, title needs work, I think.
Let me think.
Okay, let let me read it and then we'll
Okay, let let me read it and then we'll
think on title.
Honestly,
this image could be the uh you need an
this image could be the uh you need an
image for the uh the header of it. This
image for the uh the header of it. This
could be it.
could be it.
This is hilarious.
Let's see that. So, that's the main
Let's see that. So, that's the main
thing that we got to look at is the
thing that we got to look at is the
title and the uh
title and the uh
and the image.
Gamifying.
Yeah, this basically just needs to be
Yeah, this basically just needs to be
rewarded. The the thing is you're trying
rewarded. The the thing is you're trying
to say gamify your problem so that
to say gamify your problem so that
reinforcement learning can solve it.
reinforcement learning can solve it.
Like
so that header image doesn't do much.
Yeah, I don't I don't think that's a
Yeah, I don't I don't think that's a
particularly good header image.
particularly good header image.
Presumably
you have this in X article format as
you have this in X article format as
well, right?
52. I mean, honestly, this thing
52. I mean, honestly, this thing
this thing here is pretty close.
You can literally just paste this into
You can literally just paste this into
uh like a Google a Google draw and like
uh like a Google a Google draw and like
add white space on either side if it
add white space on either side if it
doesn't fit and it'll be fine.
Let me think about how we do this.
There's really nothing even about G.
There's really nothing even about G.
This is like an enticing concept, but
This is like an enticing concept, but
the article really isn't about
Maybe we do the other one today actually
Maybe we do the other one today actually
cuz I'm looking at how basic this one is
cuz I'm looking at how basic this one is
now. This one will do well, but I don't
now. This one will do well, but I don't
know if it matches the release week
know if it matches the release week
stuff as well.
stuff as well.
This is like reinforcement learning
This is like reinforcement learning
basics or something, right?
But like how to game like honestly you
But like how to game like honestly you
could make a separate article on like
could make a separate article on like
how to gify a problem for RL. This is
how to gify a problem for RL. This is
not really what this is. Like that's
not really what this is. Like that's
like a really effective thing and
like a really effective thing and
there's actually quite a bit of
there's actually quite a bit of
technical depth on that. Like if you
technical depth on that. Like if you
think about it, right, that's like a big
think about it, right, that's like a big
chunk of what I did with neural MMO 3.
chunk of what I did with neural MMO 3.
There like a ton of ways you could set
There like a ton of ways you could set
that problem up, most of which don't
that problem up, most of which don't
work.
Uh, terraform or tower climb.
This is cool. Let me let me read through
This is cool. Let me let me read through
this and see if this is a better fit.
I think the title is too long.
Uh the content is fine for the first
Uh the content is fine for the first
one. It's just I don't know if it fits
one. It's just I don't know if it fits
like staging in the release Take
Hang on. They're uh putting the
Hang on. They're uh putting the
countertop in and I guess cutting it or
countertop in and I guess cutting it or
something.
Okay, I think we're good. We'll see.
Okay, I think we're good. We'll see.
I guess they're like grinding it so it
I guess they're like grinding it so it
fits something.
Look back. What?
What's this doc article? We're uh I'm
What's this doc article? We're uh I'm
This is a Spencer wrote an article. I'm
This is a Spencer wrote an article. I'm
just looking it over. We're doing like
just looking it over. We're doing like
one article per day for uh the 3.0
one article per day for uh the 3.0
release. So, we just have tons of
release. So, we just have tons of
articles and we're just releasing one
articles and we're just releasing one
till per day until we run out.
till per day until we run out.
probably excluding the weekend.
Spencer, it would be good to mention
Spencer, it would be good to mention
that um right here that like you know
that um right here that like you know
you often you're targeting performance
you often you're targeting performance
marks that can be uh
should mention that the uh the target
should mention that the uh the target
speed can be like 10,000x what you would
speed can be like 10,000x what you would
expect for a normal game, right?
expect for a normal game, right?
Like that we can actually like you can
Like that we can actually like you can
continue to train faster like by making
continue to train faster like by making
it like a th000 to 10,000x faster than a
it like a th000 to 10,000x faster than a
normal game at least.
normal game at least.
More than 10,000 ups.
So, like in the original game, right,
So, like in the original game, right,
like a human's only going to need to
like a human's only going to need to
climb a couple blocks.
like you only need to simulate a couple
like you only need to simulate a couple
blocks per second and then it's like 60
blocks per second and then it's like 60
frames or whatever. But what we do is we
frames or whatever. But what we do is we
do like a million like movements per
do like a million like movements per
second and you can actually train a
second and you can actually train a
neural net that fast. Um, I so I guess
neural net that fast. Um, I so I guess
it's worth mentioning like just how fast
it's worth mentioning like just how fast
these things are compared to like what
these things are compared to like what
how fast a normal game would On.
What's this line supposed to be,
What's this line supposed to be,
Spencer?
I think this is there's like a missing
I think this is there's like a missing
sentence here, right? Like it's
sentence here, right? Like it's
compressed so that you uh you have lower
compressed so that you uh you have lower
CPU toGPU transfer, right?
Okay, let me see. venture.
Yeah, I just I missed it because I was
Yeah, I just I missed it because I was
distracted. It's fine. Yeah, this is
distracted. It's fine. Yeah, this is
fine. Spencer.
Yeah, this is cool. Can we get a Can we
Yeah, this is cool. Can we get a Can we
get a header image where the puffer is
get a header image where the puffer is
not like looking away from the screen?
not like looking away from the screen?
Other than that, I think this is uh
Other than that, I think this is uh
good. Now, I don't know if the title
good. Now, I don't know if the title
fits in um you got to make sure that
fits in um you got to make sure that
like the full title shows up on the
like the full title shows up on the
post.
post.
You might have to tweak that.
You might have to tweak that.
I mean, you could just use the second
I mean, you could just use the second
part to be honest if it doesn't fit.
part to be honest if it doesn't fit.
Like training AI to beat an unreasonably

is pretty good.
So, yeah, do that. Put it into an

article nicely and let me know so I can

repost it.
want to read Terra while you're at it. I
want to read Terra while you're at it. I
can look.
So, this is just an this is just Mars.
So, this is just an this is just Mars.
Doesn't show the end.
This is good. Yeah,
this is a really good quote.
this is a really good quote.
I honestly I think that after you post
I honestly I think that after you post
this, like in a couple days or
this, like in a couple days or
something, you should just tweet this as
something, you should just tweet this as
a standalone.
a standalone.
This is really good.
This is a good article, Spencer. I think
This is a good article, Spencer. I think
these two are these two are quite nice.
these two are these two are quite nice.
I don't think you post these back to
I don't think you post these back to
back. I think you do you can pick one
back. I think you do you can pick one
and then do a different one. So either
and then do a different one. So either
of these is good for today. Um
of these is good for today. Um
and then like we'll space them, right?
and then like we'll space them, right?
So like ideally we it's we probably have
So like ideally we it's we probably have
two weeks worth of articles really. So
two weeks worth of articles really. So
we'll space it so that there's different
we'll space it so that there's different
you know that there's variety. It's not
you know that there's variety. It's not
just like all the M's and then all the
just like all the M's and then all the
this and all the that. I find when I
this and all the that. I find when I
post like one M today, one M tomorrow,
post like one M today, one M tomorrow,
next day like it doesn't get much
next day like it doesn't get much
traction.
I would think again about the
I don't know if the thumbnail just
I don't know if the thumbnail just
having a random screenshot of Mars.
This is an art like you got to know that
This is an art like you got to know that
this is Okay. So, here's one thing to
this is Okay. So, here's one thing to
know about your uh about articles,
know about your uh about articles,
Spencer. This is something useful. So,
Spencer. This is something useful. So,
you got to think of the preview. So,
you got to think of the preview. So,
it'll show you the image, the title, and
it'll show you the image, the title, and
then the first couple sentences of the
then the first couple sentences of the
post. That's all it will have.
So that's all people see before they
So that's all people see before they
actually decide if they want to read the
actually decide if they want to read the
article. So they'll see like maybe this
article. So they'll see like maybe this
much like this much stuff. So I think
much like this much stuff. So I think
like the content of the article is fine.
like the content of the article is fine.
Do a little bit of thinking about how to
Do a little bit of thinking about how to
do this and then you know either this or
do this and then you know either this or
tower climb whatever. Um and I will
tower climb whatever. Um and I will
repost those as well. Like a decent a
repost those as well. Like a decent a
decent quote tweet.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh no, I forgot I had this running.
Oh no, I forgot I had this running.
Uh yeah, we generated a bunch of
Uh yeah, we generated a bunch of
garbage. Holy
going to factory tour right now. We'll
going to factory tour right now. We'll
post after. Solid.
All right,
All right,
let me see if we can actually
let me see if we can actually
make this thing work now.
Okay, so I have to drag
drag this thing which is
okay cool. So,
okay cool. So,
I mean, we can immediately see why this
I mean, we can immediately see why this
doesn't work, right?
one agent mine generator and an alter.
Number of agents will be one

and
and
96.
Like so.
And we'll see how slow this is.
K. Really?
Okay. No, we have 200k now.
See
what this does in 50 million stuff.
Let me go check on my counter as well.
So, the expected reward here, let me
So, the expected reward here, let me
think what the expected reward is. It
think what the expected reward is. It
should be quite high, right?
should be quite high, right?
Am I rewarding this thing for
just for getting rewarded for hearts?
just for getting rewarded for hearts?
But, I mean, it should pretty much just
But, I mean, it should pretty much just
be able to do
be able to do
You should be able to get tons of these.
See
if I remembered to track this.
if I remembered to track this.
Didn't. That's okay.
Didn't. That's okay.
We'll just watch it.
This should definitely be able to go
This should definitely be able to go
above one.
If it can't, then there's a problem.
Maxing at one would be very suspicious.
One heart.
It seems like there is specifically
It seems like there is specifically
only getting one is a thing.
It's a very small map. It should have no
It's a very small map. It should have no
problem with this task. So, I suspect
problem with this task. So, I suspect
that we're going to load up the policy
that we're going to load up the policy
and we're going to see something weird.
That's like the most likely.
That's like the most likely.
It is also somewhat annoying to me that

we can only do this like 50 million
we can only do this like 50 million

This thing is minimum of 10 times Well,
This thing is minimum of 10 times Well,
is it 10 times too slow? It's really
is it 10 times too slow? It's really
only two or three times too slow to
only two or three times too slow to

Yeah, this artificial life type work is
Yeah, this artificial life type work is
really cool.
There's definitely something about
There's definitely something about
I always think it's suspicious when like
I always think it's suspicious when like

Exactly one and it's never gone above

Oh,
Oh,
and corrected.
and corrected.
Went slightly above one.
I think it should just be able to do way
I think it should just be able to do way
way more than that though. We'll see
way more than that though. We'll see
from the uh the replay, I guess.
We'll see from the replay.
It also didn't take very long. 50
It also didn't take very long. 50
million steps is considered very very

Yep. Hang on.

I would like to know why this thing gets

I mean, let me tell you, the other thing
I mean, let me tell you, the other thing
that would just be great is if we
that would just be great is if we
actually could fix freaking muscular
actually could fix freaking muscular

weeks ago. Could bench 210 for 10 quite
weeks ago. Could bench 210 for 10 quite
easily.
And I mention bar
And I mention bar
ridiculous.
Let's start by fixing that crap.
I know what we're going to do.
Now these all have zero have zero
Now these all have zero have zero

Now, what we're going to do
one reward for or red.
Stay away from benching.

Thank you.
Okay. Does this make a difference?
Okay. Does this make a difference?
Looks like it does. We'll see if it's

Oh, yeah. Hypers. Just bad hypers.
This is an easy task, right?
Boom.
Quite slow. This thing better not be
Quite slow. This thing better not be
dumping replays.
I'm dumping replays. Just slow.
I'm dumping replays. Just slow.
All right.
Now we will see whether it can get um
Now we will see whether it can get um
get any reward off of this.
probably just a combination of many like
probably just a combination of many like
small changes just making it very
small changes just making it very
suboptimal for learning.
Now, it is interesting here. I don't
Now, it is interesting here. I don't
think that they're getting
think that they're getting
any Yeah, they can't do this randomly at
any Yeah, they can't do this randomly at
all.
They've kind of created a little bit of
They've kind of created a little bit of
a degenerate loop here with the reward
a degenerate loop here with the reward
structure, right?
structure, right?
like by rewarding for intermediate
like by rewarding for intermediate
products.
Did just get the reward once. There.
Let me think about this a little bit.
Hi, Hyper.
No idea what you're doing, but admire
No idea what you're doing, but admire
your discipline. I mean, I can explain
your discipline. I mean, I can explain
what I'm doing in a pretty simple way
what I'm doing in a pretty simple way
here. Like
a lot of these problems we work on are
a lot of these problems we work on are
either games or they look like games,
either games or they look like games,
right? Even the industry ones we
right? Even the industry ones we
essentially gify. So we're basically
essentially gify. So we're basically
we're just thinking about how we can get
we're just thinking about how we can get
this AI to learn to play a game uh by
this AI to learn to play a game uh by
thinking about the structure of the
thinking about the structure of the
problem and like
problem and like
kind of the way in which we're rewarding
kind of the way in which we're rewarding
the agent for doing different things in
the agent for doing different things in
the game.
the game.
What I'm kind of doing here is like
What I'm kind of doing here is like
it's sort of like how you learn math in
it's sort of like how you learn math in
school. Uh to solve this problem, you
school. Uh to solve this problem, you
have to go to this mine. You have to
have to go to this mine. You have to
collect three ore and then you have to
collect three ore and then you have to
take them over here to get a battery.
take them over here to get a battery.
And then three batteries make a heart.
And then three batteries make a heart.
So I'm kind of figuring out how I tell
So I'm kind of figuring out how I tell
the agent to like that it needs to do
the agent to like that it needs to do
these three things in a row implicitly.
I'll talk more once the vacuuming is
I'll talk more once the vacuuming is
done in here.
done in here.
I don't know if it's coming through on
I don't know if it's coming through on
the mic, but it probably is.
No noise now. Okay, I guess my filter is
No noise now. Okay, I guess my filter is
really good because I can barely hear
really good because I can barely hear
myself talking.
Um,
let me try something.
let me try something.
If they only have 10 items,
If they only have 10 items,
I don't think they can get rid of items.
I don't think they can get rid of items.
Can you get rid of items in this?
Can you get rid of items in this?
I don't think you can.
So, if you can't get rid of items,
the filter.
the filter.
It better be. This is a very nice audio
It better be. This is a very nice audio
setup.
Okay. So, my idea here is if we reward
Okay. So, my idea here is if we reward
them a little bit for ore, a little bit
them a little bit for ore, a little bit
for batteries, and a little bit for
for batteries, and a little bit for
hearts, what I would expect to happen
hearts, what I would expect to happen
naively is it's just going to like spam
naively is it's just going to like spam
ore and get this forever. Um, but if we
ore and get this forever. Um, but if we
kept the inventory to be pretty small,
kept the inventory to be pretty small,
like it's going to see that its
like it's going to see that its
inventory is full and it's going to have
inventory is full and it's going to have
to get rid of the ore and like the
to get rid of the ore and like the
resources somehow, and the only place to
resources somehow, and the only place to
get rid of it is going to be in these
get rid of it is going to be in these
other converters.
other converters.
So, we'll try that.
Again,
this is not going to tell us anything on
this is not going to tell us anything on
its own until we actually see the uh
its own until we actually see the uh
graph here.
Okay, so it's getting or
The maximum score it can get from or
The maximum score it can get from or
alone
alone
2.5 I believe.
Okay. So once it's above 2.5
Okay. So once it's above 2.5
because it has 10 slots and it gets 0.25
because it has 10 slots and it gets 0.25
rewards each.
rewards each.
So it means it has to be it has to
So it means it has to be it has to
basically be freeing up its inventory.
Let's see if I'm correct. Yes. You see
Let's see if I'm correct. Yes. You see
this? It's starting to make batteries
and hearts.
This is still going straight up.
thing is super slow about
This is what we want to see, which when
This is what we want to see, which when
we run this, I expect it's just going to
we run this, I expect it's just going to
be running between all three converters.
Don't pay attention to these graphs as

Uh, I actually don't think that these

Okay. So then they do this conversion.
It works, right?
All
right. So, this now that this works, the
right. So, this now that this works, the
question is, can we scale it up
or do we want to do the cool downs
or do we want to do the cool downs
first?
first?
Maybe we want to do the pull downs

first.
Give you three mines.
We'll
look at the
uh let's go look at their configs.
Pull down.
Pull down.
What did we say that they put
What did we say that they put
many things for there?
Two generators, 10 mines, six agents.
Two generators, 10 mines, six agents.
Okay, so we'll do like two here.
Basically, we just see whether this does

anything.
This will make it substantially harder
This will make it substantially harder
to learn.
Not really for any good reason.
Basically, just the agent can't see the
Basically, just the agent can't see the
waiting animation.
Why is it taking this long?
Oh, cuz I left the replay if you were on
Oh, cuz I left the replay if you were on
like a dummy.
Yes.
If this works,
If this works,
then possibly the full map work. See,
are they actually doing this for um
are they actually doing this for um
their configs?
Okay. So, the only problem here is I
Okay. So, the only problem here is I
don't know
don't know
the scale of anything.
Um,
this is way lower
this is way lower
and uh we don't it's not getting any
and uh we don't it's not getting any
hearts yet, which is a problem.
See if that changes.
Oh, no. It is. It's just It's at one.
Oh, no. It is. It's just It's at one.
That's actually good.
And realistically, I think that the max
And realistically, I think that the max
you can get is like two, isn't it?
you can get is like two, isn't it?
Cuz you need nine. Hang on. You need
Cuz you need nine. Hang on. You need
nine ores,
nine ores,
which you actually have to take the time
which you actually have to take the time
to collect.
I guess if you go between two mines, you

should be able to get two hearts.
You know what? I wonder if it was I

wonder if this was a straightup logging
wonder if this was a straightup logging
change.
This could have been a straightup

maybe not cuz there were 10 mines.

So that's good. Um,
So that's good. Um,
what we're going to do in the meantime,
what we're going to do in the meantime,
we're going to see if we can figure out
we're going to see if we can figure out
this meta environment and what's going

on with it.
I would love to know why it's this slow.
Can I figure out why it's this slow?
Can I figure out why it's this slow?
Actually,
Actually,
maybe I can just figure out
Yeah, let's do like test
Yeah, let's do like test
at uh
down here.
Move all this crap out of the way.
Okay. So, does this work?
Okay. So, does this work?
If so, we can run profiler on it.

Do I have um profile in here?
This is a torch profile which is not

Tricky with the way that they've

developed this specific environment.
I think I know how to do it though.
this thing All right.
So, pretty much what I'm trying to do
So, pretty much what I'm trying to do
here is I'm just trying to figure out
here is I'm just trying to figure out
why this end is so slow. Um, so I can at
why this end is so slow. Um, so I can at
least have some idea of how to set up

efficient experiments on it.

It might just be that it's just slow
It might just be that it's just slow
overall, but I'm hoping that they're
overall, but I'm hoping that they're
going to be like some combination of
going to be like some combination of
settings that are at least bearable. Uh,
settings that are at least bearable. Uh,
we're going to eventually have to
we're going to eventually have to
rewrite some sections, I think, of it or

reoptimize some sections, at least help
reoptimize some sections, at least help
the authors do that. But in the
the authors do that. But in the
meantime, just looking for something

quick.
Oh, okay. So, we actually do get
Oh, okay. So, we actually do get
This is way too big, though.
See what this does.

now. I'll be right back.
I'll have to monitor that, but

otherwise good to do a little bit of
otherwise good to do a little bit of
work for a
I figure out why this
backwards
by
Oh, I just had to add dump.
Literally just that.
Okay.
Okay.
So from this
So from this
we can see the problem
we can see the problem
and I checked
Probably the replay riders probably
Probably the replay riders probably
filling up my whole disc space as well.
That's what was happening.
And now we have
And now we have
most of the time is coming from samples.
Good.
Now, this is probably going to tell us a
Now, this is probably going to tell us a
very different story, right?
very different story, right?
Yeah, very different story.
Yeah, very different story.
That's 680k.
And that's actually as about as fast as
And that's actually as about as fast as
we should expect it to go anyways,
we should expect it to go anyways,
right? Yeah. Let's just let that train.
right? Yeah. Let's just let that train.
And actually, we'll we'll log that

And I'll tag it

Good.
Good.
Go check on the counters.
I have had a uh a piece of plywood for

All right. What's going on here? This
All right. What's going on here? This
This thing does not appear to be

Yeah. So,
let me see what we put in the config for

Actually,

maybe we should just try to run this

So, this is finishing eval. And once

this is done with Eval, we're going to
this is done with Eval, we're going to
actually now finally, and this is why
actually now finally, and this is why
it's taken me so long to actually even
it's taken me so long to actually even
do anything with this end. We didn't
do anything with this end. We didn't
have the replay viewer working. At least
have the replay viewer working. At least
now we'll be able to see what it is this
now we'll be able to see what it is this
policy is doing and whether it makes any
policy is doing and whether it makes any
sense, whether the environment is a
sense, whether the environment is a

That ought to give us a couple replays.
That ought to give us a couple replays.
Give it a minute to run.
The hope is that today we'll actually be

Got you two articles. What you think we
Got you two articles. What you think we
should post first?

Terraform.
Uh I just did
Uh I just did
two technical articles.
Don't think
Don't think
we can try. Let's see if we try this
we can try. Let's see if we try this
one.
one.
See,
uh, title needs work, I think.
Let me think.
Okay, let let me read it and then we'll
Okay, let let me read it and then we'll
think on title.
Honestly,
this image could be the uh you need an
this image could be the uh you need an
image for the uh the header of it. This
image for the uh the header of it. This
could be it.
could be it.
This is hilarious.
Let's see that. So, that's the main
Let's see that. So, that's the main
thing that we got to look at is the
thing that we got to look at is the
title and the uh
title and the uh
and the image.
Gamifying.
Yeah, this basically just needs to be
Yeah, this basically just needs to be
rewarded. The the thing is you're trying
rewarded. The the thing is you're trying
to say gamify your problem so that
to say gamify your problem so that
reinforcement learning can solve it.
reinforcement learning can solve it.
Like
so that header image doesn't do much.
Yeah, I don't I don't think that's a
Yeah, I don't I don't think that's a
particularly good header image.
particularly good header image.
Presumably
you have this in X article format as
you have this in X article format as
well, right?
52. I mean, honestly, this thing
52. I mean, honestly, this thing
this thing here is pretty close.
You can literally just paste this into
You can literally just paste this into
uh like a Google a Google draw and like
uh like a Google a Google draw and like
add white space on either side if it
add white space on either side if it
doesn't fit and it'll be fine.
Let me think about how we do this.
There's really nothing even about G.
There's really nothing even about G.
This is like an enticing concept, but
This is like an enticing concept, but
the article really isn't about
Maybe we do the other one today actually
Maybe we do the other one today actually
cuz I'm looking at how basic this one is
cuz I'm looking at how basic this one is
now. This one will do well, but I don't
now. This one will do well, but I don't
know if it matches the release week
know if it matches the release week
stuff as well.
stuff as well.
This is like reinforcement learning
This is like reinforcement learning
basics or something, right?
But like how to game like honestly you
But like how to game like honestly you
could make a separate article on like
could make a separate article on like
how to gify a problem for RL. This is
how to gify a problem for RL. This is
not really what this is. Like that's
not really what this is. Like that's
like a really effective thing and
like a really effective thing and
there's actually quite a bit of
there's actually quite a bit of
technical depth on that. Like if you
technical depth on that. Like if you
think about it, right, that's like a big
think about it, right, that's like a big
chunk of what I did with neural MMO 3.
chunk of what I did with neural MMO 3.
There like a ton of ways you could set
There like a ton of ways you could set
that problem up, most of which don't
that problem up, most of which don't
work.
Uh, terraform or tower climb.
This is cool. Let me let me read through
This is cool. Let me let me read through
this and see if this is a better fit.
I think the title is too long.
Uh the content is fine for the first
Uh the content is fine for the first
one. It's just I don't know if it fits
one. It's just I don't know if it fits
like staging in the release Take
Hang on. They're uh putting the
Hang on. They're uh putting the
countertop in and I guess cutting it or

something.
Okay, I think we're good. We'll see.
Okay, I think we're good. We'll see.
I guess they're like grinding it so it
I guess they're like grinding it so it
fits something.
Look back. What?
What's this doc article? We're uh I'm
What's this doc article? We're uh I'm
This is a Spencer wrote an article. I'm
This is a Spencer wrote an article. I'm
just looking it over. We're doing like
just looking it over. We're doing like
one article per day for uh the 3.0
one article per day for uh the 3.0
release. So, we just have tons of
release. So, we just have tons of
articles and we're just releasing one
articles and we're just releasing one
till per day until we run out.
till per day until we run out.
probably excluding the weekend.
Spencer, it would be good to mention
Spencer, it would be good to mention
that um right here that like you know
that um right here that like you know
you often you're targeting performance
you often you're targeting performance
marks that can be uh
should mention that the uh the target
should mention that the uh the target
speed can be like 10,000x what you would
speed can be like 10,000x what you would
expect for a normal game, right?
expect for a normal game, right?
Like that we can actually like you can
Like that we can actually like you can
continue to train faster like by making
continue to train faster like by making
it like a th000 to 10,000x faster than a
it like a th000 to 10,000x faster than a
normal game at least.
normal game at least.
More than 10,000 ups.
So, like in the original game, right,
So, like in the original game, right,
like a human's only going to need to
like a human's only going to need to
climb a couple blocks.
like you only need to simulate a couple
like you only need to simulate a couple
blocks per second and then it's like 60
blocks per second and then it's like 60
frames or whatever. But what we do is we
frames or whatever. But what we do is we
do like a million like movements per
do like a million like movements per
second and you can actually train a
second and you can actually train a
neural net that fast. Um, I so I guess
neural net that fast. Um, I so I guess
it's worth mentioning like just how fast
it's worth mentioning like just how fast
these things are compared to like what
these things are compared to like what
how fast a normal game would On.
What's this line supposed to be,
What's this line supposed to be,
Spencer?
I think this is there's like a missing
I think this is there's like a missing
sentence here, right? Like it's
sentence here, right? Like it's
compressed so that you uh you have lower
compressed so that you uh you have lower
CPU toGPU transfer, right?
Okay, let me see. venture.
Yeah, I just I missed it because I was
Yeah, I just I missed it because I was
distracted. It's fine. Yeah, this is
distracted. It's fine. Yeah, this is
fine. Spencer.
Yeah, this is cool. Can we get a Can we
Yeah, this is cool. Can we get a Can we
get a header image where the puffer is
get a header image where the puffer is
not like looking away from the screen?
not like looking away from the screen?
Other than that, I think this is uh
Other than that, I think this is uh
good. Now, I don't know if the title
good. Now, I don't know if the title
fits in um you got to make sure that
fits in um you got to make sure that
like the full title shows up on the
like the full title shows up on the

You might have to tweak that.
You might have to tweak that.
I mean, you could just use the second

is pretty good.
So, yeah, do that. Put it into an

repost it.

want to read Terra while you're at it. I
can look.
So, this is just an this is just Mars.
So, this is just an this is just Mars.
Doesn't show the end.
This is good. Yeah,
this is a really good quote.
this is a really good quote.
I honestly I think that after you post
I honestly I think that after you post
this, like in a couple days or
this, like in a couple days or
something, you should just tweet this as
something, you should just tweet this as
a standalone.
a standalone.
This is really good.
This is a good article, Spencer. I think
This is a good article, Spencer. I think
these two are these two are quite nice.
these two are these two are quite nice.
I don't think you post these back to
I don't think you post these back to
back. I think you do you can pick one
back. I think you do you can pick one
and then do a different one. So either
and then do a different one. So either
of these is good for today. Um
of these is good for today. Um
and then like we'll space them, right?
and then like we'll space them, right?
So like ideally we it's we probably have
So like ideally we it's we probably have
two weeks worth of articles really. So
two weeks worth of articles really. So
we'll space it so that there's different
we'll space it so that there's different
you know that there's variety. It's not
you know that there's variety. It's not
just like all the M's and then all the
just like all the M's and then all the
this and all the that. I find when I
this and all the that. I find when I
post like one M today, one M tomorrow,
post like one M today, one M tomorrow,
next day like it doesn't get much
next day like it doesn't get much
traction.
I would think again about the
I don't know if the thumbnail just
I don't know if the thumbnail just
having a random screenshot of Mars.
This is an art like you got to know that
This is an art like you got to know that
this is Okay. So, here's one thing to
this is Okay. So, here's one thing to
know about your uh about articles,
know about your uh about articles,
Spencer. This is something useful. So,
Spencer. This is something useful. So,
you got to think of the preview. So,
you got to think of the preview. So,
it'll show you the image, the title, and
it'll show you the image, the title, and
then the first couple sentences of the
then the first couple sentences of the
post. That's all it will have.
So that's all people see before they
So that's all people see before they
actually decide if they want to read the
actually decide if they want to read the
article. So they'll see like maybe this
article. So they'll see like maybe this
much like this much stuff. So I think
much like this much stuff. So I think
like the content of the article is fine.
like the content of the article is fine.
Do a little bit of thinking about how to
Do a little bit of thinking about how to
do this and then you know either this or
do this and then you know either this or
tower climb whatever. Um and I will
tower climb whatever. Um and I will
repost those as well. Like a decent a
repost those as well. Like a decent a
decent quote tweet.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh no, I forgot I had this running.
Oh no, I forgot I had this running.
Uh yeah, we generated a bunch of
Uh yeah, we generated a bunch of
garbage. Holy
going to factory tour right now. We'll
going to factory tour right now. We'll
post after. Solid.
All right,
All right,
let me see if we can actually
let me see if we can actually
make this thing work now.
Okay, so I have to drag
drag this thing which is
okay cool. So,
okay cool. So,
I mean, we can immediately see why this
I mean, we can immediately see why this
doesn't work, right?
one agent mine generator and an alter.
Number of agents will be one

and
and
96.
Like so.
And we'll see how slow this is.
K. Really?
Okay. No, we have 200k now.
See
what this does in 50 million stuff.
Let me go check on my counter as well.
So, the expected reward here, let me
So, the expected reward here, let me
think what the expected reward is. It
think what the expected reward is. It
should be quite high, right?
should be quite high, right?
Am I rewarding this thing for
just for getting rewarded for hearts?
just for getting rewarded for hearts?
But, I mean, it should pretty much just
But, I mean, it should pretty much just
be able to do
be able to do
You should be able to get tons of these.
See
if I remembered to track this.
if I remembered to track this.
Didn't. That's okay.
Didn't. That's okay.
We'll just watch it.
This should definitely be able to go
This should definitely be able to go
above one.
If it can't, then there's a problem.
Maxing at one would be very suspicious.
One heart.
It seems like there is specifically
It seems like there is specifically
only getting one is a thing.
It's a very small map. It should have no
It's a very small map. It should have no
problem with this task. So, I suspect
problem with this task. So, I suspect
that we're going to load up the policy
that we're going to load up the policy
and we're going to see something weird.
That's like the most likely.
That's like the most likely.
It is also somewhat annoying to me that

I go see what they're
Interesting that this thing is like

Now we will see whether it can get um

Let me think about this a little bit.
Hi, Hyper.
No idea what you're doing, but admire
No idea what you're doing, but admire
your discipline. I mean, I can explain
your discipline. I mean, I can explain
what I'm doing in a pretty simple way
what I'm doing in a pretty simple way
here. Like
a lot of these problems we work on are
a lot of these problems we work on are
either games or they look like games,
either games or they look like games,
right? Even the industry ones we
right? Even the industry ones we
essentially gify. So we're basically
essentially gify. So we're basically
we're just thinking about how we can get
we're just thinking about how we can get
this AI to learn to play a game uh by
this AI to learn to play a game uh by
thinking about the structure of the

problem and like

kind of the way in which we're rewarding
kind of the way in which we're rewarding
the agent for doing different things in
the agent for doing different things in
the game.
the game.
What I'm kind of doing here is like
What I'm kind of doing here is like
it's sort of like how you learn math in
it's sort of like how you learn math in
school. Uh to solve this problem, you
school. Uh to solve this problem, you
have to go to this mine. You have to
have to go to this mine. You have to
collect three ore and then you have to
collect three ore and then you have to
take them over here to get a battery.
take them over here to get a battery.
And then three batteries make a heart.
And then three batteries make a heart.
So I'm kind of figuring out how I tell
So I'm kind of figuring out how I tell
the agent to like that it needs to do
the agent to like that it needs to do
these three things in a row implicitly.
I'll talk more once the vacuuming is

I don't know if it's coming through on
I don't know if it's coming through on

No noise now. Okay, I guess my filter is
No noise now. Okay, I guess my filter is
really good because I can barely hear
really good because I can barely hear
myself talking.
Um,
let me try something.
let me try something.
If they only have 10 items,
If they only have 10 items,
I don't think they can get rid of items.
I don't think they can get rid of items.
Can you get rid of items in this?

I don't think you can.
So, if you can't get rid of items,
the filter.
the filter.
It better be. This is a very nice audio
It better be. This is a very nice audio
setup.
Okay. So, my idea here is if we reward
Okay. So, my idea here is if we reward
them a little bit for ore, a little bit
them a little bit for ore, a little bit
for batteries, and a little bit for
for batteries, and a little bit for
hearts, what I would expect to happen
hearts, what I would expect to happen
naively is it's just going to like spam
naively is it's just going to like spam
ore and get this forever. Um, but if we
ore and get this forever. Um, but if we
kept the inventory to be pretty small,
kept the inventory to be pretty small,
like it's going to see that its
like it's going to see that its
inventory is full and it's going to have
inventory is full and it's going to have
to get rid of the ore and like the
to get rid of the ore and like the
resources somehow, and the only place to

get rid of it is going to be in these
get rid of it is going to be in these
other converters.

So, we'll try that.
Again,
this is not going to tell us anything on
this is not going to tell us anything on

Okay, so it's getting or
The maximum score it can get from or

Okay. So once it's above 2.5

So it means it has to be it has to
So it means it has to be it has to
basically be freeing up its inventory.
Let's see if I'm correct. Yes. You see
Let's see if I'm correct. Yes. You see
this? It's starting to make batteries
and hearts.
This is still going straight up.
thing is super slow about
This is what we want to see, which when
This is what we want to see, which when
we run this, I expect it's just going to
we run this, I expect it's just going to
be running between all three converters.
Don't pay attention to these graphs as

Okay. So then they do this conversion.
It works, right?
All
right. So, this now that this works, the
right. So, this now that this works, the
question is, can we scale it up
or do we want to do the cool downs
or do we want to do the cool downs
first?
first?
Maybe we want to do the pull downs

first.
Give you three mines.
We'll
look at the
uh let's go look at their configs.
Pull down.

What did we say that they put
What did we say that they put
many things for there?
Two generators, 10 mines, six agents.
Two generators, 10 mines, six agents.
Okay, so we'll do like two here.
Basically, we just see whether this does

anything.
This will make it substantially harder

to learn.
Not really for any good reason.
Basically, just the agent can't see the
Basically, just the agent can't see the
waiting animation.
Why is it taking this long?
Oh, cuz I left the replay if you were on
Oh, cuz I left the replay if you were on
like a dummy.
Yes.
If this works,
If this works,
then possibly the full map work. See,
are they actually doing this for um
are they actually doing this for um
their configs?
Okay. So, the only problem here is I
Okay. So, the only problem here is I
don't know
don't know
the scale of anything.
Um,
this is way lower
this is way lower
and uh we don't it's not getting any
and uh we don't it's not getting any
hearts yet, which is a problem.
See if that changes.
Oh, no. It is. It's just It's at one.
Oh, no. It is. It's just It's at one.
That's actually good.
And realistically, I think that the max
And realistically, I think that the max
you can get is like two, isn't it?
you can get is like two, isn't it?
Cuz you need nine. Hang on. You need
Cuz you need nine. Hang on. You need
nine ores,
nine ores,
which you actually have to take the time
which you actually have to take the time
to collect.
I guess if you go between two mines, you
I guess if you go between two mines, you
should be able to get two hearts.
You know what? I wonder if it was I
You know what? I wonder if it was I
wonder if this was a straightup logging
wonder if this was a straightup logging
change.
This could have been a straightup
This could have been a straightup

maybe not cuz there were 10 mines.
