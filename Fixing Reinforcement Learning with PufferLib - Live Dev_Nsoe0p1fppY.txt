the
heck I think we're
back all right that was weird
okay this is nice
this is
good so now you actually get a
good so now you actually get a
clean uh you get a clean error on this
and if I pass back over
work then you're allowed to do
it you do this full time
it you do this full time
yep puffer AI is fixing reinforcement
learning we're making everything f fast
learning we're making everything f fast
andan at the moment there's a lot of
andan at the moment there's a lot of
just polish stuff gearing up for the
just polish stuff gearing up for the
next
release um but there's also quite a bit
release um but there's also quite a bit
of interesting open source work going on
of interesting open source work going on
as

well so this is this is the new version
well so this is this is the new version
of docs that will be just at puffer
of docs that will be just at puffer

thanks
thanks yeah and then the defaults here
thanks yeah and then the defaults here
are set up for 24 core machines so it
are set up for 24 core machines so it
makes sense that we get this by

coming into play we got lots of

contributors that are just doing General
end work and building ends and stuff and

it's
it's
all very
useful environment does not support

okay so we're going to have to figure
okay so we're going to have to figure
this thing out I think as well the
this thing out I think as well the
priority should be though that the ocean
priority should be though that the ocean
Ms work
Ms work
nicely that's going to be the
nicely that's going to be the
priority and right now I don't think I'm
priority and right now I don't think I'm
fully satisfied with the way these are
fully satisfied with the way these are
bound go back to
docks so this a on its own is
fine and
forks trying to think if I like this or
forks trying to think if I like this or
not
I think the reason that I did this is
I think the reason that I did this is
because you can pass Stu as like a list
because you can pass Stu as like a list
or
whatever so they'll probably need to be
whatever so they'll probably need to be
some testing around that
yeah this type of thing is so awkward
right cuz if you have like a list of
right cuz if you have like a list of
arcs now you have to pass a list of list
arcs now you have to pass a list of list
or if you have a n qus now you have to
or if you have a n qus now you have to
pass a list of dictionaries that's just
pass a list of dictionaries that's just
gross I mean but the only alternative is
gross I mean but the only alternative is
you have to pass like a list of lambdas
you have to pass like a list of lambdas
which I think is
which I think is
worse
potentially maybe I don't need to
potentially maybe I don't need to
rethink this portion right
rethink this portion right
now I mean I don't want to like
that's a pretty low priority change I
that's a pretty low priority change I
think I don't think I've had anybody get
think I don't think I've had anybody get
super confused by this
super confused by this
specifically so if I keep that for
specifically so if I keep that for
now
then then I think that the only main
thing is going to have to
be the actual binds themselves right
yeah so we have all
yeah so we have all
these it's like 200 lines of stuff in
these it's like 200 lines of stuff in
here and most of it doesn't really need
here and most of it doesn't really need
to exist I
to exist I
think space
is sanity M could use an update
yeah I think that this
yeah I think that this
thing goes into
thing goes into
snake and then like most of these are
snake and then like most of these are
dated like I don't even know if these
dated like I don't even know if these
work at the
work at the
moment morning
so yeah I think we just
so yeah I think we just
move we move these into snake
we set these all to none
we set these all to none
and
then we add like preset
equals 360p here
I don't really like the way that I have
I don't really like the way that I have
the arguments being chosen at the
moment like with these
presets I'm trying to think if I even
presets I'm trying to think if I even
need any of this right the best
need any of this right the best
the best thing would just not would be
the best thing would just not would be
to not have this code here
I mean I made it this way for curriculum
I mean I made it this way for curriculum
learning
right what if I just do
is is just your default
okay for Interval Max sake length
render mode is
human I just get rid of all these
human I just get rid of all these
precepts
yeah that's just better isn't
yeah that's just better isn't
it then we don't have this confusing
it then we don't have this confusing
thing
thing
here and you just specify what you
here and you just specify what you
want way easier
yeah the best version I think of the
yeah the best version I think of the
preset is no
preset spacing is bothering me but it
preset spacing is bothering me but it
really doesn't matter I believe it the
really doesn't matter I believe it the
original way I'm quiet so
uh this
here you have to be able to check if the
here you have to be able to check if the
thing is iterable right
this stuff is so
obnoxious I think this is clear enough
do I want to like go through and put API
do I want to like go through and put API
usage errors on
everything I think I probably do
right e
the thing is you get the type
checks I guess it's
fine
for e
okay got total
snakes what do we use snake shape
snakes what do we use snake shape
for we literally do not use snake shape
oh yeah I
see I don't even know if this should be
see I don't even know if this should be
a
parameter or we should just compute it
parameter or we should just compute it
automatically
I think that's in decent shape
I don't know if I want to like just let
I don't know if I want to like just let
them be in decent shape though or if I
them be in decent shape though or if I
want to go through and just like fully
want to go through and just like fully
polish and finish each one maybe that
polish and finish each one maybe that
would be
better I think that's probably better
better I think that's probably better
just so I know it's fully fully done
the thing is like the C implementation
the thing is like the C implementation
code can always be
better e
yeah literally so this this actually
yeah literally so this this actually
just goes
away right this just goes
away right this just goes
away and uh we get to add
away and uh we get to add
snake like
I think that's
it okay that's actually
cleaner like that
