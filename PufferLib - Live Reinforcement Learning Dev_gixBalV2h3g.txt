We're stuck with 3 0 on this one repro.
We're stuck with 3 0 on this one repro.
It's really annoying.
Um, I don't know what's wrong with it. I
Um, I don't know what's wrong with it. I

on look at this. So I told this thing to
on look at this. So I told this thing to
run like 200 mil runs of 200 mil or

whatever and
whatever and
like like quite as well as it

like a few% off here, but it doesn't run
like a few% off here, but it doesn't run
longer and longer experiments. Like

Um, but it doesn't hardly run any longer
Um, but it doesn't hardly run any longer
experiments at all.
So, we're going to see with this run,
So, we're going to see with this run,
this new one, whether it runs longer
this new one, whether it runs longer
experiments, and if not, if it actually

does something reasonable with a 300 mil
does something reasonable with a 300 mil

write fiddly experiments today. We're
write fiddly experiments today. We're
going to actually do something that's

Why is this not

is we're actually going to be able to

make this do
make this do
some crazy stuff. So I all I got to do

is I switch the model. Hang

and go to the ship model.
Great. Is that a distributed ML

might go by color.
Maybe that would be a good way to do it.

very cool one. Okay, I'll back it up and
very cool one. Okay, I'll back it up and
then
I'll frequency.
So the idea for today is going to be
So the idea for today is going to be
we're going to introduce
we're going to introduce
handling. Um so I'm going to do like
handling. Um so I'm going to do like
float handling
float uh
I had to do max
I don't see 3.0 zero. Oh, never mind.
I don't see 3.0 zero. Oh, never mind.
I was looking at my
[ __ ] you.
What was that?
I'm going to dip out of here for a bit
I'm going to dip out of here for a bit
so I get back to stream. But uh let me
so I get back to stream. But uh let me
know if you have stuff. All right. All
know if you have stuff. All right. All
right. You too.
Cuz otherwise I'm just going to be like
Cuz otherwise I'm just going to be like
narrating to myself with him just
narrating to myself with him just
hanging out.
hanging out.
So yeah, what I want to do
So yeah, what I want to do
here actually helps me focus a lot. Uh,
here actually helps me focus a lot. Uh,
just going through all my stuff out
just going through all my stuff out
loud,
too. Something like this. So, we have
too. Something like this. So, we have
like these update abilities.
Okay. And then we do agent items. So we
Okay. And then we do agent items. So we
do update
abilities. And then if
abilities. And then if
they if they hit
they if they hit
this update the abilities as well.
And
And
now have move ship.
something basic like this, right?
Let me try one thing. They're uh telling
Let me try one thing. They're uh telling
me to replace the or to do it with the
me to replace the or to do it with the

thing gets farther
now. Also, these boot really slow
now. Also, these boot really slow
compared to desktop

cables are seated.
biggest issue we've had in
biggest issue we've had in
shipping. Let me go check and see if
shipping. Let me go check and see if
this boots here.
Seems like it does stuff.
I think if I reboot it, go direct to the
I think if I reboot it, go direct to the
other menu or
what? They give it a few minutes.
Try that again. Hope that this boots and
Try that again. Hope that this boots and
then be able to keep working on the end
then be able to keep working on the end
for a bit. But if I can actually get
for a bit. But if I can actually get
these training today, I mean, that would
these training today, I mean, that would
be awesome.
Well, I'm going to give it some time to
Well, I'm going to give it some time to
see if it uh does anything.
All
right, grab the uh where's the
right, grab the uh where's the
chat chat Daniel.
See if this uh trains with the new
See if this uh trains with the new
handling stuff and if it looks any
handling stuff and if it looks any
different.
Okay, it is starting to
train. So, we will see if we actually
train. So, we will see if we actually
notice a
difference assuming this does actually
difference assuming this does actually
train decently.
Not training super
well. Might just train for
longer. Love the training. Uh UI, thank
you. Okay, the green ones and the red
you. Okay, the green ones and the red
ones are doing
ones are doing
it. The yellow ones are like
slow. We'll let it train for a little
slow. We'll let it train for a little
longer
though. at like
250.
250.
See, still stuck on that
menu. I think I'm going to end up having
menu. I think I'm going to end up having
to go
um receat some GPUs.
Yeah, there we go. Just needed a little
Yeah, there we go. Just needed a little
longer to figure it out.
And this is
And this is
um
um
heterogeneous training in the sense that
heterogeneous training in the sense that
not all the agents have the same
not all the agents have the same
capabilities. That's pretty cool.
Yeah, this is really cool. So, like you
Yeah, this is really cool. So, like you
can see the green ones are super
fast, the yellow ones are super
fast, the yellow ones are super
slow. How do you figure out what the
slow. How do you figure out what the
best model architecture is? We do very
best model architecture is? We do very
very little with the architecture.
very little with the architecture.
Honestly, hyperparameters are the big
Honestly, hyperparameters are the big
gotcha, not
gotcha, not
architecture. This is straight up like a
architecture. This is straight up like a
linear layer or two into a uh LSTM and
linear layer or two into a uh LSTM and
then the LSTM is the core for
everything. I mean, this is sweet. This
everything. I mean, this is sweet. This
is legitimately here. This is
is legitimately here. This is
heterogeneous heterogeneous learning.
and this trained in a minute. This is
and this trained in a minute. This is
not something I've actually seen done in
not something I've actually seen done in
a very long time either. Like there are
a very long time either. Like there are
very few cases of RL in RL of people
very few cases of RL in RL of people
even doing this and it just
works. Like like to be clear here, it's
works. Like like to be clear here, it's
the same neural network uh controlling
the same neural network uh controlling
each ship
each ship
independently even though the ships have
independently even though the ships have
different capabilities. Like when they
different capabilities. Like when they
change color, they have different

have like a wider turn radius, like a
have like a wider turn radius, like a
much wider turn radius or like a much

speed. Hey,
Will. How's it going?
Yeah, I uh this project I started this
Yeah, I uh this project I started this
simulator yesterday for
simulator yesterday for
reference. So this is literally and I've
reference. So this is literally and I've
worked on it like less than an hour
worked on it like less than an hour
today. So this is one day of what Puffer
today. So this is one day of what Puffer
Lib can

do. Is there momentum for the puffers?
do. Is there momentum for the puffers?
Uh there I don't think
Uh there I don't think
there's they can't change like they're
there's they can't change like they're
locked to their maximum speed. So,
locked to their maximum speed. So,
there's a turning radius basically.
there's a turning radius basically.
There's not momentum, but there's a
There's not momentum, but there's a
turning radius. I want
it. What do you want to do with puffer,
it. What do you want to do with puffer,
man? We got all sorts of cool
man? We got all sorts of cool
RL. We're working on this. We've got a
RL. We're working on this. We've got a
new terraforming simulator we're working
new terraforming simulator we're working
on. I mean, I'm basically just stuck
on. I mean, I'm basically just stuck
with 300 because freaking we've got bugs
with 300 because freaking we've got bugs
on the new machines that So, I'm having
on the new machines that So, I'm having
tough times testing DDP on them. I guess
tough times testing DDP on them. I guess
I could just boot up H00s, but I'd like
I could just boot up H00s, but I'd like
to test it locally. And then the much
to test it locally. And then the much
bigger one is sweeps are driving me
bigger one is sweeps are driving me
insane because like there's a PF gap
insane because like there's a PF gap
between the old version and the current
between the old version and the current
version of sweeps even when I run the
version of sweeps even when I run the
old version of the code. So there's
old version of the code. So there's
something's haunted there. I've got some
something's haunted there. I've got some
experiments going on that. But as soon
experiments going on that. But as soon
as we fix that, it's kind of like, you
as we fix that, it's kind of like, you
know, export all the new models, make
know, export all the new models, make
sure everything is fine, and then just
sure everything is fine, and then just
ship it. We already have the blog post
ship it. We already have the blog post
done. We've got basically everything.
It's super
It's super
cursed. But yeah, that's the been the
cursed. But yeah, that's the been the
main thing that's been screwing me on 3
main thing that's been screwing me on 3
0 is just that one last thing I can't
0 is just that one last thing I can't
track down. So, I got bored and I made
track down. So, I got bored and I made
this yesterday. Um, I'm going to make
this yesterday. Um, I'm going to make
this like a full scale like ship combat
this like a full scale like ship combat
thing. So, I'm going to add the I'm
thing. So, I'm going to add the I'm
going to add the ability for them to
going to add the ability for them to
fire at each other and they're going to
fire at each other and they're going to
have like different strengths and speeds
have like different strengths and speeds
and stuff. So, uh, the hope is that
and stuff. So, uh, the hope is that
we're going to actually get some
we're going to actually get some
tactical looking like full-on aerial
tactical looking like full-on aerial
space sim thing and we're actually
space sim thing and we're actually
really going to push the limits of what
really going to push the limits of what
we can do with like, you know,
we can do with like, you know,
decentralized multi- aent
intelligence. This is the small version
intelligence. This is the small version
as well. Like I can train this way
as well. Like I can train this way
bigger here.
bigger here.
Not. Let's see if it's stable at
4096 here. We'll see if this is stable.
4096 here. We'll see if this is stable.
Oh, I got to up the factories as
well. Huge congrats. Thanks, man. It's
well. Huge congrats. Thanks, man. It's
been so much work. It's been so so much
been so much work. It's been so so much
work, but like RL kind of just works
work, but like RL kind of just works
now. Um, it's not like solved. There's
now. Um, it's not like solved. There's
still stuff I need to do on the research
still stuff I need to do on the research
side, but
side, but
um yeah, it's good enough that we're
um yeah, it's good enough that we're
going to be able to solve a ton of
going to be able to solve a ton of
industry problems and uh hopefully that
industry problems and uh hopefully that
will get us some bigger clients. So,
will get us some bigger clients. So,
we'll uh kind of be able to just take on
we'll uh kind of be able to just take on
bigger and bigger stuff from there. That
bigger and bigger stuff from there. That
is the
is the
hope. Any lessons on the research
hope. Any lessons on the research
side? Yeah, we're no longer just using
side? Yeah, we're no longer just using
PO like we have some substantial
PO like we have some substantial
modifications to it. uh in the latest
modifications to it. uh in the latest
version of the code. Um different

different advantage function, filtering,
different advantage function, filtering,
prioritize replay. Like there's a bunch
prioritize replay. Like there's a bunch
of stuff that we did, but the like the
of stuff that we did, but the like the
idea that it's like 80% just use PO, 20%
idea that it's like 80% just use PO, 20%
figure out some tweaks was pretty
spot-on. Okay, here's the big version of
spot-on. Okay, here's the big version of

Actually, I I overshot. So, it'll take 3
Actually, I I overshot. So, it'll take 3
minutes to like finish the run. It's not
minutes to like finish the run. It's not
going to checkpoint till then. And then
going to checkpoint till then. And then
we'll look at the 4096 agents version of

trying to do with all this RL stuff?
It's pretty funny that nobody's buying
It's pretty funny that nobody's buying
their uh the AMD tiny boxes. Everyone's

still buying the Nvidia ones cuz like
still buying the Nvidia ones cuz like
it's like free is not cheap enough for

Oh. Uh, I should have made the map
Oh. Uh, I should have made the map
bigger. Will, but there you go. It still
bigger. Will, but there you go. It still
looks pretty cool, right?
Yeah, that's pretty freaking
Yeah, that's pretty freaking
cool. So fast. Nah, man. We're trolling
cool. So fast. Nah, man. We're trolling
at the moment. This is like a third of
at the moment. This is like a third of
the speed that it should be running at.
the speed that it should be running at.
We should be able to train this like 4
We should be able to train this like 4
million steps per second, no
million steps per second, no
problem. This is like the most dog [ __ ]

So you gota you got to realize like when
So you gota you got to realize like when
I like when I'm doing like horrible n
I like when I'm doing like horrible n
squ loops over everything like you got
squ loops over everything like you got
to realize how bad RL was before that we
to realize how bad RL was before that we
couldn't get stuff
couldn't get stuff
working. This is like a few hundred
working. This is like a few hundred
lines of
code. Oh yeah. You want to see something
code. Oh yeah. You want to see something
fun? Yeah. Let me show you something
fun? Yeah. Let me show you something
fun.
Uh, I might do Oct three stuff, but not
Uh, I might do Oct three stuff, but not
yet. I'm basically I'm going to do this
yet. I'm basically I'm going to do this
until I'm like forced to not do this,
until I'm like forced to not do this,
you know.
No, it's not PO deacto. Like we have
No, it's not PO deacto. Like we have
modified PO to the like significantly
modified PO to the like significantly
enough that you can't just call it
enough that you can't just call it
vanilla
PO. We have our own stuff now, man.
done a lot of
research. All right, so this is a little
research. All right, so this is a little
harder to run fast, but
harder to run fast, but
uh look at all the puffers.
Well, we'll go back to the fast glider
Well, we'll go back to the fast glider
model, but it's funny to have the puffer
model, but it's funny to have the puffer
in there.
I'm trying to think if I want to add
I'm trying to think if I want to add
combat right now or if I want to go deal
combat right now or if I want to go deal
with freaking tiny boxes. I think I can
with freaking tiny boxes. I think I can
chill for a bit here and add some uh add
chill for a bit here and add some uh add
combat to this. That'll be fun. I will
combat to this. That'll be fun. I will
have to do tiny boxes today,
have to do tiny boxes today,
but we can do this for a bit
first. This is should be a super
first. This is should be a super
consistent training setup as well.
I feel they shouldn't be able to steer
I feel they shouldn't be able to steer
that fast. Some of them steer fast and
that fast. Some of them steer fast and
some of them move fast. It's a
some of them move fast. It's a
trade-off. So now you can do really
trade-off. So now you can do really
sample

efficient really do sample
efficient really do sample
efficiency. I mean I could. What I'd
efficiency. I mean I could. What I'd
rather do though is I'd rather just take
rather do though is I'd rather just take
this, find some very important problems
this, find some very important problems
in industry where we can build fast
in industry where we can build fast
sims, right? And just knock them out of
sims, right? And just knock them out of
the park. So start with
the park. So start with
that. Way easier to do that than it's
that. Way easier to do that than it's
going to be to like do all the sample
going to be to like do all the sample
efficiency research. We've kind of just
efficiency research. We've kind of just
been doing R&D for the last year, right?
been doing R&D for the last year, right?
With like a few clients. We kind of want
With like a few clients. We kind of want
to get some bigger stuff going at this
to get some bigger stuff going at this

Why wouldn't it
Why wouldn't it
be superhuman at

everything we throw at it.
If this frame's in 100

actually more likely to find some cool
actually more likely to find some cool
problems in the high data regime because
problems in the high data regime because
like basically nobody's bothered with
like basically nobody's bothered with
those, right? Like because researchers
those, right? Like because researchers
don't know how to code. But nobody's
don't know how to code. But nobody's
bothered with the hm I wonder what
bothered with the hm I wonder what
happens if we just build fast sims for

Uh that's where like curriculum and
Uh that's where like curriculum and
reward stuff comes in.
Um, you got to think of it as kind of
Um, you got to think of it as kind of
like breadcrumbs, right? You got like
like breadcrumbs, right? You got like
the problem has to be self-contained and
learnable. But that's like that's not a
learnable. But that's like that's not a
method problem, right? That's like a

fundamental like that's a fundamental

Okay, this clearly trains. Let's start

Why would I have to join a company when
Why would I have to join a company when
they can just hire our company,
right? I like literally we're at the
right? I like literally we're at the
point with all the stuff where I've
point with all the stuff where I've
built where it's like it's way more
built where it's like it's way more
valuable to hire Puffer than it is to
valuable to hire Puffer than it is to
just hire me because
just hire me because
like if you just hired me a year ago to
like if you just hired me a year ago to
like work on some problem, right? It
like work on some problem, right? It
wouldn't be as good as now. Like I
wouldn't be as good as now. Like I
wouldn't have as good of a solution for
wouldn't have as good of a solution for
your specific problem as we now have out
your specific problem as we now have out
of the box for basically all problems.
I mean that they could
I mean that they could
do. I'm not really looking to like sell
do. I'm not really looking to like sell
Huffer for dimes and then like you know
Huffer for dimes and then like you know
join a thing though. I'd be way way
join a thing though. I'd be way way
happier like and like honestly the best
happier like and like honestly the best
value for companies is going to be to
value for companies is going to be to
toss us like some sizable
contracts. It's going to be the best
contracts. It's going to be the best
value for them.
Like there really aren't any like
Like there really aren't any like
there's not really any reason to not do
there's not really any reason to not do
that because the thing is like all our
that because the thing is like all our
core stuff is open source. So it's not
core stuff is open source. So it's not
like you're dependent on like some third
like you're dependent on like some third
party locked API, right?
I think I'll change your mind. We can
I think I'll change your mind. We can
chat if you've got
ideas. Are you still based in SF? Have
ideas. Are you still based in SF? Have
you wait are you based in SF still or
you wait are you based in SF still or
you
moved? Cuz I got to say it would be a
moved? Cuz I got to say it would be a
pretty big number to get me to go from
pretty big number to get me to go from
here to SF. It's like and I'm probably
here to SF. It's like and I'm probably
going to be more productive from here
anyways. SF is kind of
depressing. I don't know.
depressing. I don't know.
It depends what the It depends what the
It depends what the It depends what the
purpose is,
right? Like what is the thing like

what's the

we're going to sell more ads with

reinforcement
learning? Right.
Because like I can be persuaded to sell
Because like I can be persuaded to sell
more ads with reinforcement learning,
more ads with reinforcement learning,
but then I'm basically going to have to
but then I'm basically going to have to
be set where it's like, "All right, I'll
be set where it's like, "All right, I'll
come do this for a year or two. We'll
come do this for a year or two. We'll
fix that." And then I'm going to be set
fix that." And then I'm going to be set
for the next indefinite amount of time
for the next indefinite amount of time
to go do cool research and like fund
to go do cool research and like fund
whatever stuff I want, right?
Because pretty much my goal is to just
Because pretty much my goal is to just
be able to do all sorts of fundamental
be able to do all sorts of fundamental
tech research and to be able to bankroll
tech research and to be able to bankroll
it. I kind of just want to be able to
it. I kind of just want to be able to
have my own private
have my own private
lab where I do crazy
lab where I do crazy
things, which is sort of what we're
things, which is sort of what we're
doing now. Just slightly larger scale
doing now. Just slightly larger scale
than this, but we're already doing quite
than this, but we're already doing quite
a bit. All right, so this is super cool.
a bit. All right, so this is super cool.
This just works. Let's uh let's add in
This just works. Let's uh let's add in
combat and see what happens. So the idea
combat and see what happens. So the idea
for combat
here, private lab with a farm is
here, private lab with a farm is
academia dream. Yeah, dude. Like I get
academia dream. Yeah, dude. Like I get
so much more work done here. It's not
so much more work done here. It's not
even close. Like there are zero
even close. Like there are zero
distractions whatsoever. Um normally it
distractions whatsoever. Um normally it
wouldn't be 14 16 hours a day, right? It
wouldn't be 14 16 hours a day, right? It
would be like 12 to 14 because I would
would be like 12 to 14 because I would
get some more exercise in. Uh I'm
get some more exercise in. Uh I'm
freaking bad shoulder, bad knee,
freaking bad shoulder, bad knee,
whatever. So, I can't do anything. But,
whatever. So, I can't do anything. But,
uh, I mean, still, it's like it's pretty
uh, I mean, still, it's like it's pretty
great for focus. And then in the last
great for focus. And then in the last
couple weeks, I've just been trying to
couple weeks, I've just been trying to
cut out like all the filler crap, right?
cut out like all the filler crap, right?
Like I would just I've been like
Like I would just I've been like
watching tons of just YouTube and [ __ ]
watching tons of just YouTube and [ __ ]
just in between doing other things. And
just in between doing other things. And
like even if you're not wasting any time
like even if you're not wasting any time
that you could be working just like in
that you could be working just like in
between stuff, it still takes your mind
between stuff, it still takes your mind
off of problems. So, I've been trying to
off of problems. So, I've been trying to
just like really focus myself to only
just like really focus myself to only
think about research and like I've come
think about research and like I've come
up with a lot of good stuff as a result
up with a lot of good stuff as a result
of
that. Things are getting like pretty
that. Things are getting like pretty
damn dialed in.
Okay.
So, we got to add
attack damage and attack rage. Get out
attack damage and attack rage. Get out
of here,
of here,
bot. I code the bot, not
you. And one thing
You got to do attack damage and attack
You got to do attack damage and attack
speed,
speed,
right? Or is it attack whatever
Okay.
Okay.
So, we need to do angle to target, I
So, we need to do angle to target, I
believe. Uh, that is slightly
believe. Uh, that is slightly
awkward.
awkward.
So, angle to target.
There
normalize.
normalize.
No. All right.
this. Okay. And now what we got to do is
shoulder is just so screwed up. I can't
shoulder is just so screwed up. I can't
even put it on the
armrest. Back range.
And we need
angle. Is this
it? That doesn't seem right, is it? Oh
it? That doesn't seem right, is it? Oh
yeah, it is. It is just arc close, isn't
it? And that's in
it? And that's in
radians. So 90° is pi / 2. We do pi over
radians. So 90° is pi / 2. We do pi over
4ish, maybe
4ish, maybe
45°ree, that's like
45°ree, that's like
this. That's too wide.
this. That's too wide.
30° over six.
return
false. Now we do damage which is going
false. Now we do damage which is going
to be
You want to do damage calcs in
You want to do damage calcs in
this? I have to respawn the agent,
this? I have to respawn the agent,
right?
reward. Don't
I just do it this way. So this is just
I just do it this way. So this is just
the attack function just tells
the attack function just tells
you, right?
Yeah, the attack function is just going
Yeah, the attack function is just going
to tell you this. So we
to tell you this. So we
do if
do if
attack. So this is where we have to do
attack. So this is where we have to do
the jank thing, right? So we have to do
the jank thing, right? So we have to do
for this terrible jank
for this terrible jank
thing. Okay. Okay. And then we have to
thing. Okay. Okay. And then we have to
do
if
if
[Music]
not continue. Okay. And then we are
attacking. So the target
attacking. So the target
HP down by damage.
Um, add some reward for
Um, add some reward for
this. Target HP is zero. Then we respawn
this. Target HP is zero. Then we respawn
it.
And it also needs to be uh its reward
And it also needs to be uh its reward
needs to be canned, right?
We have to do mems set on the rewards.
Yeah, that thing's stuck. I'm going to
Yeah, that thing's stuck. I'm going to
have to go do maintenance at some point
have to go do maintenance at some point
later today. Let's ignore that for now,
later today. Let's ignore that for now,
though.
do
do
that. We are accounted for
here. This
They only attack things on a different
They only attack things on a different
team.
And that's about it, right?
Okay. So, we'll see if this does
Okay. So, we'll see if this does
anything.
overflowing some agents times times.
This is unsigned
char. Okay, cool.
Now, if there is in front of them an
Now, if there is in front of them an
agent of a different
agent of a different
color, they should be
fighting. We'll see if that does
fighting. We'll see if that does
anything.
Episode length three seems to imply that
Episode length three seems to imply that
they are killing each other all the
they are killing each other all the
time.
time.
Whoops. Okay, that might be
1 is a pretty big
1 is a pretty big
radius. Kind of
reasonable probably just too many
reasonable probably just too many
agents, right? So like let me think if
agents, right? So like let me think if
you were to
you were to
have I think 1,024 like tops, right?
and a map that size.
That trains faster as
well. Probably have to draw the
well. Probably have to draw the
lasers.
Let's add a in Target.
and draw a line segment like that.
Right. Now we actually should be able to
Right. Now we actually should be able to
see what they're
doing. Except that if they die, it's
doing. Except that if they die, it's
going to
going to
be it's going to be jank.
I think what I want to
I think what I want to
do is something just very slightly
do is something just very slightly
different
here. Kind of tough at how to do this.
here. Kind of tough at how to do this.
It might end up having to be multiple
It might end up having to be multiple
passes. We'll do this for now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jeez.
Jeez.
Holy. Yeah, that's not what we wanted,
Holy. Yeah, that's not what we wanted,
right?
something screw with this. It should
something screw with this. It should
only be like 10% of the uh the volume
only be like 10% of the uh the volume
for attack
range. These are like super long lines,
range. These are like super long lines,
right? Yeah, you can see
them. Oh, it's cuz I didn't clear. Did I
them. Oh, it's cuz I didn't clear. Did I
not clear the target?
and clear the
target. Okay, so that's way too fast,
target. Okay, so that's way too fast,
first of all.
But like the lines are too long as well.
But like the lines are too long as well.
It shouldn't be able to do that. But I
It shouldn't be able to do that. But I
think what's happening is Yeah, I know
think what's happening is Yeah, I know
why this is happening. Okay. Trying to
why this is happening. Okay. Trying to
think how I fix
that. I think we do all the moves
that. I think we do all the moves
happen.
So all the moves happen
So all the moves happen
first and then all the attacks
happen after.
And
And
then this target health
thing. Okay. This like target health
thingy. This is now going to be
Okay, they are fighting here.
I can figure out how to like make the
I can figure out how to like make the
lasers not just be one frame later.
Right. For now, this is fine.
very very low range that they have.
It's annoying. Um, shoulder is not
It's annoying. Um, shoulder is not
liking me typing up
here. Put my keyboard on my lap. Hate
here. Put my keyboard on my lap. Hate
typing this way as well, but
's comfortable, man.
Like there is just not
Happy. Okay. So, that's way more
Happy. Okay. So, that's way more
obvious,
obvious,
right? Yeah. And now they're kung fu
fighting. Spawn each color in a
fighting. Spawn each color in a
uh a different corner, I guess.
Remove the target seeking reward.
target seeking
target seeking
reward. Instead, we just do combat and
reward. Instead, we just do combat and
then
All
right, let's see what this
does. See if this gives us something
does. See if this gives us something
like interpretable.
Well, the episode length is decreasing,
Well, the episode length is decreasing,
which means they must be
fighting. Oh, it goes back
fighting. Oh, it goes back
up kind of.
We shall
see. Might have to add like a scripted
faction. Whoa.
faction. Whoa.
What? Huh?
Let's uh let's make the spawns a little
Let's uh let's make the spawns a little
bit more
bit more
reasonable. We're getting very close to
reasonable. We're getting very close to
crazy things here.
So the thing that I forgotten about
um so this has got to be -1F 1.0
um so this has got to be -1F 1.0
F which is
like okay zero we got negative one got
like okay zero we got negative one got
one I don't know what we do with the
one I don't know what we do with the
last guys
do this. We'll see what they do.
episode length has been going back up,
episode length has been going back up,
but it's actually hard to know what that
but it's actually hard to know what that
means in a vacuum.
dude.
Is this like greens up? Yeah, this is
Is this like greens up? Yeah, this is
green spawning here. So, the greens are
green spawning here. So, the greens are
getting spawn
camped. That's no good.
supposed to do health.
make it easier to
make it easier to
see. All right, we're going to train
see. All right, we're going to train
this. Then I'm going to figure out what
this. Then I'm going to figure out what
we're going to do from here cuz this is
we're going to do from here cuz this is
like this was not all that difficult to
like this was not all that difficult to
get like the basics
get like the basics
of to figure out how to make it more
of to figure out how to make it more
coordinated and
stuff. I should be able to actually
stuff. I should be able to actually
arrange these reasonably if I'm smart
arrange these reasonably if I'm smart
about it. I'm trying this
Okay, we will see what this does. Grab a
Okay, we will see what this does. Grab a
drink though. Like to fix the shoulder,
drink though. Like to fix the shoulder,
man.
Don't even have a tub here or anything
Don't even have a tub here or anything
yet. Like soak this
thing.
thing.
Uhhuh. Whoa.
Uhhuh. Whoa.
Look at these
Guys, anybody spawn in the corner or
Guys, anybody spawn in the corner or
they just going there to like avoid
they just going there to like avoid
being
killed? The blue ones are just like,
killed? The blue ones are just like,
"Yeah, we're going to the go to the
"Yeah, we're going to the go to the
corner." Enemy OP. What can we
do?
do?
Oh, okay. randomly raining very hard all
Oh, okay. randomly raining very hard all
of a sudden out of nowhere.
Let me think what I actually want to do
Let me think what I actually want to do
with this sim. Like, how far do I want
with this sim. Like, how far do I want
to take this thing? I think I want to
do a few different types of
ships. Let me see like find some games I
ships. Let me see like find some games I
can use for inspiration.
There's a game that used to be on
iOS
iOS
battle. You'll find
it at
gravity. Is it
this? I forget what it was.
There are lots of them though,
right? I
right? I
also I would like to be able to reskin
also I would like to be able to reskin
this thing pretty easily. Like if I want
this thing pretty easily. Like if I want
it to be like space or like air ground
it to be like space or like air ground
or
or
whatever. So
like
like
tank. What are usually like the unit
tank. What are usually like the unit
types people have? It's like
types people have? It's like
infantry like tank.
How do you use RL for something like
How do you use RL for something like
Magic the Gathering where a human onlyly
Magic the Gathering where a human onlyly
interacts through clicking a UI? Uh like
interacts through clicking a UI? Uh like
this we have had there's a PR I have to
this we have had there's a PR I have to
merge on this that adds a lot of more
merge on this that adds a lot of more
stuff to it. But this was like a very
stuff to it. But this was like a very
super basic prototype. Okay. So like you
super basic prototype. Okay. So like you
can play a land can't do anything else
can play a land can't do anything else
on your first turn except actually yeah
on your first turn except actually yeah
that's a zero cost. Do this. I can swing
that's a zero cost. Do this. I can swing
with uh I can swing with
with uh I can swing with
this and then let's see I can play my
this and then let's see I can play my
land. I can play my two
cost and then I can swing with this and
cost and then I can swing with this and
this. Let's
this. Let's
see that. And then I can let's play the
see that. And then I can let's play the
three cost. Swing with this this and
three cost. Swing with this this and
this. Um, and then, oh, I'm getting
this. Um, and then, oh, I'm getting
attacked. So, I have to block with my
attacked. So, I have to block with my
Yeah, I'll block with this. And then
Yeah, I'll block with this. And then
like that. And then, can I play this
like that. And then, can I play this
yet? No, I can't play that
yet? No, I can't play that
yet. So, I'm going to swing. Four, five,
yet. So, I'm going to swing. Four, five,
six, seven, eight. And I win. That is
six, seven, eight. And I win. That is
how I would make Magic the Gathering
how I would make Magic the Gathering
work for reinforcement learning.
work for reinforcement learning.
You can play, you can play it entirely
You can play, you can play it entirely
with your number keys and
enter. If you want to help finish that,

don't want to go through the API, you
don't want to go through the API, you
would do some basic vision thing on top
would do some basic vision thing on top
of it. You wouldn't end RL it like

We're just going to have to look at the

now it's a cooperative environment kind
of. There we go.
Yeah, this seems much better,
Don't need this. Well, now I got to do
it. Way better. We'll see. Got to see
it. Way better. We'll see. Got to see
the

things that I'm using. It's just I'm
using them very
nicely. I got brand new programmers
nicely. I got brand new programmers
writing uh C environments with us.
It's a good
time. And the funny thing is I hated C
time. And the funny thing is I hated C
for 10 years. You know why? Cuz when
for 10 years. You know why? Cuz when
they taught it in uh in undergrad, they
they taught it in uh in undergrad, they
didn't tell you what an address
didn't tell you what an address

So, let's see. So, next

up, I think we want to

do units, like different units, right?
We already have the basic infrastructure
We already have the basic infrastructure
in place for

Jojo. Yeah, I know.

Jojo, that's like those are pretty good
hours.
I think this is all kind of
I think this is all kind of
fine. We just need to like
I don't know.
just let's
All right. So, now we have this fighter
All right. So, now we have this fighter
agent. Got this like reasonably
agent. Got this like reasonably
done. Just
um rest of
this this
Looks reasonable.
Looks reasonable.
Right now we have to do scales.
identifier
identifier
agent. Ah, it's entity.
Okay. Yeah, those are too freaking big.
Okay. Yeah, those are too freaking big.
But
We'll show you what this
does. All
right, battle train and we'll see
right, battle train and we'll see
whether we have spaceship battle sim and
whether we have spaceship battle sim and
come back right back.
Okay. I mean, this is It says it's doing
something.
something.
Holy, that's a space battle sim and a
Holy, that's a space battle sim and a
half. What on
half. What on
earth? Yo.
They got way too many tanks, I
think. Yeah, they got way too many
think. Yeah, they got way too many
tanks.
I'm just going to recompile and rerun
I'm just going to recompile and rerun
without
without
training to
see. So, they got a ton of fighters, a
see. So, they got a ton of fighters, a
few tanks, and then the mother ship.
[Laughter]
This is something. Pull away.
Yeah, that's cool.
I don't like how it's like the
I don't like how it's like the
continuous streams rather than like
continuous streams rather than like
clouds though. So, the thing I was
clouds though. So, the thing I was
thinking about is respawning them on the
thinking about is respawning them on the
mother ship.
So now they
So now they
respawn on the position of the mother
respawn on the position of the mother
ship.
Is that
right? Yeah, they all kind of like just
right? Yeah, they all kind of like just
showed up at the same spot randomly.
What's happening
here? It's like they all spawn
here. Know why they all spawn in there?
here. Know why they all spawn in there?
That's weird.
What? How' this
happen? Yeah, this is the mother ship,
happen? Yeah, this is the mother ship,
right?
Oh, right.
Oh, right.
Yeah, this is fine.
Yeah, they all spawn from the same spot
Yeah, they all spawn from the same spot
for some
reason.
Hm.
Hm.
Oh, I think I know.
Yeah, that works.
Yeah, this should be pretty cool
looking cuz now like the thing is they
looking cuz now like the thing is they
should kind of spawn in clouds and I
should kind of spawn in clouds and I
think you'll get like more reasonable
think you'll get like more reasonable
like battles out of it.
Oh, that's freaking
Oh, that's freaking
cool. Yeah. Look, like here comes like
cool. Yeah. Look, like here comes like
this whole cloud of like new fighters,
this whole cloud of like new fighters,
right?
might be cooler with the random
corner. Do random corner.
Now there's some randomization in
Now there's some randomization in
it. It'll produce some interesting
it. It'll produce some interesting
battles.
Holy.
Okay. Think it's too long right now,
Okay. Think it's too long right now,
right? Like it would be cooler
right? Like it would be cooler
with this
format. I think with this format it's
format. I think with this format it's
going to be cooler if I do like like
going to be cooler if I do like like
this maybe
This is so boring. I can feel my hair
growing. If watching
growing. If watching
uh Science Advanced Live is boring, then
uh Science Advanced Live is boring, then
you're free to go back to Tik Tok.
This is some pretty awesome
science. I think we'll we have to do
science. I think we'll we have to do
like a little bit of All right. We have
like a little bit of All right. We have
to write a few things here to get this
to write a few things here to get this
into like the most empty corner, I
into like the most empty corner, I
think.
this this. Oh, we do need this
type. Oh.
This gives you the minimum
distance, but it should not be agent
have these chords
have these chords
correct. This is like negative
1,1 positive one.
one.
[Music]
I think this is it.
I'm just trying to find the farthest
I'm just trying to find the farthest
like the best corner to spawn them in.
This is the closest agent.
Yeah, there it is. So, the distance of
Yeah, there it is. So, the distance of
from the other agent to the corner
Okay. like
distance of
There we
are. So, this is uh was a fair bit of
are. So, this is uh was a fair bit of
code, but if I have this correct
expected
expected
expression. This needs to be curly
expression. This needs to be curly
braces. So, if I have this correct, this
braces. So, if I have this correct, this
should look a lot better because they
should look a lot better because they
will no longer spawn on top of each
will no longer spawn on top of each
other. They should only
other. They should only
spawn near the uh the nearest what is
spawn near the uh the nearest what is
it? A corner that's relatively free.
Yeah. So, they're all spawning on top of
Yeah. So, they're all spawning on top of
each other. So, I probably did. It's
each other. So, I probably did. It's
probably the other way
probably the other way
around. Yeah. Yeah, we want max desk.
Boom. See if this does what we want and
Boom. See if this does what we want and
then we'll retrain.
Okay, first of all, that's not the right
coordinate. And second of all, they're
coordinate. And second of all, they're
still spawning on top of each
still spawning on top of each
other. Okay.
did not
did not
rebuild. That seems
rebuild. That seems
weird. Like that's not what I would have
weird. Like that's not what I would have
expected it to have
done. Oh yeah, they shouldn't be able to
done. Oh yeah, they shouldn't be able to
spawn there.
Interesting.
those distances make
those distances make
sense. I think they
do. This has got to be float.
We'll see if that does
anything. Okay.
Yeah, that was a reasonable spawn. That
Yeah, that was a reasonable spawn. That
was a reasonable spawn.
was a reasonable spawn.
Perfect. Oh, this is so much better.
I mean, that's
I mean, that's
freaking that's pretty crazy.
spread them out a little more. Maybe
Not quite enough ships, I
Not quite enough ships, I
think, to do it that
think, to do it that
way. I'd like it to be sparser. It's
way. I'd like it to be sparser. It's
going to look cooler.
I'm done asking. So you admit you've
I'm done asking. So you admit you've
asked. You admit
asked. You admit
it. Aha.
Now, that was my brother-in-law. Yeah.
Okay. So, it runs in the family is what
Okay. So, it runs in the family is what
you're saying.
That's pretty freaking cool.
Get him to retrain.
and just enjoy the cool uh the cool
and just enjoy the cool uh the cool

today. We got some real fun stuff.
This might be too difficult for it to

Not really one of

those. The fact that this works is kind
of crazy.
See, actually I can just There's
Nice project. Thank you.
That's pretty freaking
cool. Each one has a job. This is a new
cool. Each one has a job. This is a new
version. We have um I mean there are
version. We have um I mean there are
fighter units. There are like frigots
fighter units. There are like frigots
and then there's a mother ship. And this
and then there's a mother ship. And this
is a large scale

going off. We've got like space battle
going off. We've got like space battle

That's so freaking
cool. Why don't you make 3D
cool. Why don't you make 3D

then
I'll frequency.
So the idea for today is going to be
So the idea for today is going to be
we're going to introduce
we're going to introduce

float handling
float uh
I had to do max
I don't see 3.0 zero. Oh, never mind.
I don't see 3.0 zero. Oh, never mind.
I was looking at my

What was that?
I'm going to dip out of here for a bit

so I get back to stream. But uh let me
so I get back to stream. But uh let me
know if you have stuff. All right. All

right. You too.
Cuz otherwise I'm just going to be like
Cuz otherwise I'm just going to be like

narrating to myself with him just
hanging out.
hanging out.
So yeah, what I want to do
So yeah, what I want to do
here actually helps me focus a lot. Uh,
here actually helps me focus a lot. Uh,
just going through all my stuff out
just going through all my stuff out
loud,
too. Something like this. So, we have
too. Something like this. So, we have
like these update abilities.
Okay. And then we do agent items. So we
Okay. And then we do agent items. So we
do update
abilities. And then if

they if they hit
they if they hit
this update the abilities as well.
And
And
now have move ship.
something basic like this, right?
Let me try one thing. They're uh telling

shipping. Let me go check and see if
this boots here.
Seems like it does stuff.
I think if I reboot it, go direct to the
I think if I reboot it, go direct to the
other menu or
what? They give it a few minutes.
Try that again. Hope that this boots and
Try that again. Hope that this boots and
then be able to keep working on the end
then be able to keep working on the end
for a bit. But if I can actually get
for a bit. But if I can actually get
these training today, I mean, that would
these training today, I mean, that would
be awesome.
Well, I'm going to give it some time to
Well, I'm going to give it some time to
see if it uh does anything.
All
right, grab the uh where's the
right, grab the uh where's the
chat chat Daniel.
See if this uh trains with the new
See if this uh trains with the new
handling stuff and if it looks any
handling stuff and if it looks any
different.
Okay, it is starting to
train. So, we will see if we actually
train. So, we will see if we actually
notice a
difference assuming this does actually
difference assuming this does actually
train decently.
Not training super
well. Might just train for
longer. Love the training. Uh UI, thank
you. Okay, the green ones and the red
you. Okay, the green ones and the red
ones are doing
ones are doing
it. The yellow ones are like
slow. We'll let it train for a little
slow. We'll let it train for a little
longer
though. at like
250.
250.
See, still stuck on that
menu. I think I'm going to end up having
menu. I think I'm going to end up having
to go
um receat some GPUs.
Yeah, there we go. Just needed a little
Yeah, there we go. Just needed a little
longer to figure it out.
And this is
And this is
um
um
heterogeneous training in the sense that
heterogeneous training in the sense that
not all the agents have the same
not all the agents have the same
capabilities. That's pretty cool.
Yeah, this is really cool. So, like you
Yeah, this is really cool. So, like you
can see the green ones are super
fast, the yellow ones are super
fast, the yellow ones are super
slow. How do you figure out what the
slow. How do you figure out what the

very few cases of RL in RL of people
even doing this and it just

Yeah, I uh this project I started this
Yeah, I uh this project I started this

worked on it like less than an hour
worked on it like less than an hour

Uh there I don't think
Uh there I don't think
there's they can't change like they're

locked to their maximum speed. So,
there's a turning radius basically.

RL. We're working on this. We've got a
RL. We're working on this. We've got a
new terraforming simulator we're working
new terraforming simulator we're working
on. I mean, I'm basically just stuck
on. I mean, I'm basically just stuck
with 300 because freaking we've got bugs
with 300 because freaking we've got bugs
on the new machines that So, I'm having
on the new machines that So, I'm having
tough times testing DDP on them. I guess
tough times testing DDP on them. I guess
I could just boot up H00s, but I'd like
I could just boot up H00s, but I'd like
to test it locally. And then the much
to test it locally. And then the much
bigger one is sweeps are driving me
bigger one is sweeps are driving me
insane because like there's a PF gap
insane because like there's a PF gap
between the old version and the current
between the old version and the current
version of sweeps even when I run the
version of sweeps even when I run the
old version of the code. So there's
old version of the code. So there's
something's haunted there. I've got some
something's haunted there. I've got some
experiments going on that. But as soon
experiments going on that. But as soon
as we fix that, it's kind of like, you
as we fix that, it's kind of like, you
know, export all the new models, make
know, export all the new models, make
sure everything is fine, and then just
sure everything is fine, and then just
ship it. We already have the blog post
ship it. We already have the blog post
done. We've got basically everything.
It's super
It's super
cursed. But yeah, that's the been the

main thing that's been screwing me on 3

0 is just that one last thing I can't
track down. So, I got bored and I made
track down. So, I got bored and I made
this yesterday. Um, I'm going to make
this yesterday. Um, I'm going to make
this like a full scale like ship combat
this like a full scale like ship combat
thing. So, I'm going to add the I'm
thing. So, I'm going to add the I'm
going to add the ability for them to

fire at each other and they're going to
fire at each other and they're going to
have like different strengths and speeds
have like different strengths and speeds
and stuff. So, uh, the hope is that
and stuff. So, uh, the hope is that
we're going to actually get some
we're going to actually get some
tactical looking like full-on aerial

really going to push the limits of what

harder to run fast, but
harder to run fast, but
uh look at all the puffers.
Well, we'll go back to the fast glider
Well, we'll go back to the fast glider

combat to this. That'll be fun. I will
have to do tiny boxes today,

freaking bad shoulder, bad knee,
freaking bad shoulder, bad knee,

whatever. So, I can't do anything. But,
uh, I mean, still, it's like it's pretty
uh, I mean, still, it's like it's pretty
great for focus. And then in the last
great for focus. And then in the last
couple weeks, I've just been trying to
couple weeks, I've just been trying to
cut out like all the filler crap, right?

just in between doing other things. And
like even if you're not wasting any time
like even if you're not wasting any time
that you could be working just like in
that you could be working just like in

between stuff, it still takes your mind
off of problems. So, I've been trying to
off of problems. So, I've been trying to
just like really focus myself to only

this. Okay. And now what we got to do is
shoulder is just so screwed up. I can't
shoulder is just so screwed up. I can't
even put it on the

And we need
angle. Is this
it? That doesn't seem right, is it? Oh
it? That doesn't seem right, is it? Oh
yeah, it is. It is just arc close, isn't
it? And that's in
it? And that's in
radians. So 90° is pi / 2. We do pi over
radians. So 90° is pi / 2. We do pi over
4ish, maybe
4ish, maybe
45°ree, that's like
45°ree, that's like

here. Kind of tough at how to do this.
here. Kind of tough at how to do this.
It might end up having to be multiple
It might end up having to be multiple
passes. We'll do this for now.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jeez.
Jeez.
Holy. Yeah, that's not what we wanted,
Holy. Yeah, that's not what we wanted,
right?
something screw with this. It should
something screw with this. It should
only be like 10% of the uh the volume
only be like 10% of the uh the volume
for attack
range. These are like super long lines,
range. These are like super long lines,
right? Yeah, you can see
them. Oh, it's cuz I didn't clear. Did I
them. Oh, it's cuz I didn't clear. Did I
not clear the target?
and clear the
target. Okay, so that's way too fast,
target. Okay, so that's way too fast,
first of all.
But like the lines are too long as well.
But like the lines are too long as well.
It shouldn't be able to do that. But I
It shouldn't be able to do that. But I
think what's happening is Yeah, I know
think what's happening is Yeah, I know
why this is happening. Okay. Trying to
why this is happening. Okay. Trying to
think how I fix
that. I think we do all the moves
that. I think we do all the moves
happen.
So all the moves happen
So all the moves happen
first and then all the attacks
happen after.
And
And
then this target health
thing. Okay. This like target health
thingy. This is now going to be
Okay, they are fighting here.
I can figure out how to like make the
I can figure out how to like make the
lasers not just be one frame later.
Right. For now, this is fine.
very very low range that they have.
It's annoying. Um, shoulder is not
It's annoying. Um, shoulder is not
liking me typing up
here. Put my keyboard on my lap. Hate
here. Put my keyboard on my lap. Hate
typing this way as well, but
's comfortable, man.
Like there is just not
Happy. Okay. So, that's way more
Happy. Okay. So, that's way more
obvious,
obvious,
right? Yeah. And now they're kung fu
fighting. Spawn each color in a
fighting. Spawn each color in a
uh a different corner, I guess.
Remove the target seeking reward.
target seeking
target seeking
reward. Instead, we just do combat and
reward. Instead, we just do combat and
then
All
right, let's see what this
does. See if this gives us something
does. See if this gives us something
like interpretable.
Well, the episode length is decreasing,
Well, the episode length is decreasing,
which means they must be
fighting. Oh, it goes back
fighting. Oh, it goes back
up kind of.
We shall
see. Might have to add like a scripted
faction. Whoa.
faction. Whoa.
What? Huh?
Let's uh let's make the spawns a little
Let's uh let's make the spawns a little
bit more
bit more
reasonable. We're getting very close to
reasonable. We're getting very close to
crazy things here.
So the thing that I forgotten about
um so this has got to be -1F 1.0
um so this has got to be -1F 1.0
F which is
like okay zero we got negative one got
like okay zero we got negative one got
one I don't know what we do with the
one I don't know what we do with the
last guys
do this. We'll see what they do.
episode length has been going back up,
episode length has been going back up,
but it's actually hard to know what that
but it's actually hard to know what that
means in a vacuum.
dude.
Is this like greens up? Yeah, this is
Is this like greens up? Yeah, this is
green spawning here. So, the greens are
green spawning here. So, the greens are
getting spawn
camped. That's no good.
supposed to do health.
make it easier to
make it easier to
see. All right, we're going to train
see. All right, we're going to train
this. Then I'm going to figure out what
this. Then I'm going to figure out what
we're going to do from here cuz this is
we're going to do from here cuz this is
like this was not all that difficult to
like this was not all that difficult to
get like the basics
get like the basics
of to figure out how to make it more
of to figure out how to make it more
coordinated and
stuff. I should be able to actually
stuff. I should be able to actually
arrange these reasonably if I'm smart
arrange these reasonably if I'm smart
about it. I'm trying this
Okay, we will see what this does. Grab a
Okay, we will see what this does. Grab a
drink though. Like to fix the shoulder,
drink though. Like to fix the shoulder,
man.
Don't even have a tub here or anything
Don't even have a tub here or anything
yet. Like soak this
thing.
thing.
Uhhuh. Whoa.
Uhhuh. Whoa.
Look at these
Guys, anybody spawn in the corner or
Guys, anybody spawn in the corner or
they just going there to like avoid
they just going there to like avoid
being
killed? The blue ones are just like,
killed? The blue ones are just like,
"Yeah, we're going to the go to the
"Yeah, we're going to the go to the
corner." Enemy OP. What can we
do?
do?
Oh, okay. randomly raining very hard all
Oh, okay. randomly raining very hard all
of a sudden out of nowhere.
Let me think what I actually want to do
Let me think what I actually want to do
with this sim. Like, how far do I want
with this sim. Like, how far do I want
to take this thing? I think I want to
do a few different types of
ships. Let me see like find some games I
ships. Let me see like find some games I
can use for inspiration.
There's a game that used to be on
iOS
iOS
battle. You'll find
it at
gravity. Is it
this? I forget what it was.
There are lots of them though,
right? I
right? I
also I would like to be able to reskin
also I would like to be able to reskin
this thing pretty easily. Like if I want
this thing pretty easily. Like if I want
it to be like space or like air ground
it to be like space or like air ground
or
or
whatever. So
like
like
tank. What are usually like the unit
tank. What are usually like the unit
types people have? It's like
types people have? It's like
infantry like tank.
How do you use RL for something like
How do you use RL for something like
Magic the Gathering where a human onlyly
Magic the Gathering where a human onlyly
interacts through clicking a UI? Uh like
interacts through clicking a UI? Uh like
this we have had there's a PR I have to
this we have had there's a PR I have to
merge on this that adds a lot of more
merge on this that adds a lot of more
stuff to it. But this was like a very
stuff to it. But this was like a very
super basic prototype. Okay. So like you
super basic prototype. Okay. So like you
can play a land can't do anything else
can play a land can't do anything else
on your first turn except actually yeah
on your first turn except actually yeah
that's a zero cost. Do this. I can swing
that's a zero cost. Do this. I can swing
with uh I can swing with
with uh I can swing with
this and then let's see I can play my
this and then let's see I can play my
land. I can play my two
cost and then I can swing with this and
cost and then I can swing with this and
this. Let's
this. Let's
see that. And then I can let's play the
see that. And then I can let's play the
three cost. Swing with this this and
three cost. Swing with this this and
this. Um, and then, oh, I'm getting
this. Um, and then, oh, I'm getting
attacked. So, I have to block with my
attacked. So, I have to block with my
Yeah, I'll block with this. And then
Yeah, I'll block with this. And then
like that. And then, can I play this
like that. And then, can I play this
yet? No, I can't play that
yet? No, I can't play that
yet. So, I'm going to swing. Four, five,
yet. So, I'm going to swing. Four, five,
six, seven, eight. And I win. That is
six, seven, eight. And I win. That is
how I would make Magic the Gathering
how I would make Magic the Gathering
work for reinforcement learning.

usually you just go through the API.
You can, by the way, you can absolutely

make RL end to end on pixels with

Basically, the only way that episode

end there. That way I can actually track
end there. That way I can actually track

Now, this should keep going up because
Now, this should keep going up because
now it's a cooperative environment kind
of. There we go.
Yeah, this seems much better,
Don't need this. Well, now I got to do
it. Way better. We'll see. Got to see
it. Way better. We'll see. Got to see

using them very
nicely. I got brand new programmers
nicely. I got brand new programmers
writing uh C environments with us.
It's a good
time. And the funny thing is I hated C
time. And the funny thing is I hated C
for 10 years. You know why? Cuz when
for 10 years. You know why? Cuz when
they taught it in uh in undergrad, they
they taught it in uh in undergrad, they
didn't tell you what an address
didn't tell you what an address

We already have the basic infrastructure

Jojo, that's like those are pretty good

I think this is all kind of
I think this is all kind of
fine. We just need to like
I don't know.
just let's
All right. So, now we have this fighter
All right. So, now we have this fighter
agent. Got this like reasonably

done. Just
um rest of
this this
Looks reasonable.
Looks reasonable.
Right now we have to do scales.

agent. Ah, it's entity.
Okay. Yeah, those are too freaking big.
Okay. Yeah, those are too freaking big.
But
We'll show you what this
does. All
right, battle train and we'll see
right, battle train and we'll see
whether we have spaceship battle sim and
whether we have spaceship battle sim and
come back right back.
Okay. I mean, this is It says it's doing
something.
something.
Holy, that's a space battle sim and a
Holy, that's a space battle sim and a
half. What on
half. What on
earth? Yo.
They got way too many tanks, I
think. Yeah, they got way too many
think. Yeah, they got way too many
tanks.
I'm just going to recompile and rerun
I'm just going to recompile and rerun
without
without
training to
see. So, they got a ton of fighters, a
see. So, they got a ton of fighters, a
few tanks, and then the mother ship.
[Laughter]
This is something. Pull away.
Yeah, that's cool.
I don't like how it's like the
I don't like how it's like the
continuous streams rather than like
continuous streams rather than like
clouds though. So, the thing I was
clouds though. So, the thing I was
thinking about is respawning them on the
thinking about is respawning them on the
mother ship.
So now they
So now they
respawn on the position of the mother
respawn on the position of the mother
ship.
Is that
right? Yeah, they all kind of like just
right? Yeah, they all kind of like just
showed up at the same spot randomly.
What's happening
here? It's like they all spawn
here. Know why they all spawn in there?
here. Know why they all spawn in there?
That's weird.
What? How' this
happen? Yeah, this is the mother ship,
happen? Yeah, this is the mother ship,
right?
Oh, right.
Oh, right.
Yeah, this is fine.
Yeah, they all spawn from the same spot
Yeah, they all spawn from the same spot
for some
reason.
Hm.
Hm.
Oh, I think I know.
Yeah, that works.
Yeah, this should be pretty cool
looking cuz now like the thing is they
looking cuz now like the thing is they
should kind of spawn in clouds and I
should kind of spawn in clouds and I
think you'll get like more reasonable
think you'll get like more reasonable
like battles out of it.
Oh, that's freaking
Oh, that's freaking
cool. Yeah. Look, like here comes like
cool. Yeah. Look, like here comes like
this whole cloud of like new fighters,
this whole cloud of like new fighters,
right?
might be cooler with the random
corner. Do random corner.
Now there's some randomization in
Now there's some randomization in
it. It'll produce some interesting
it. It'll produce some interesting
battles.
Holy.
Okay. Think it's too long right now,
Okay. Think it's too long right now,
right? Like it would be cooler
right? Like it would be cooler
with this
format. I think with this format it's
format. I think with this format it's
going to be cooler if I do like like
going to be cooler if I do like like
this maybe
This is so boring. I can feel my hair
growing. If watching
growing. If watching
uh Science Advanced Live is boring, then
uh Science Advanced Live is boring, then
you're free to go back to Tik Tok.
This is some pretty awesome
science. I think we'll we have to do
science. I think we'll we have to do
like a little bit of All right. We have
like a little bit of All right. We have
to write a few things here to get this
to write a few things here to get this
into like the most empty corner, I
into like the most empty corner, I
think.
this this. Oh, we do need this
type. Oh.
This gives you the minimum
distance, but it should not be agent
have these chords
have these chords
correct. This is like negative
1,1 positive one.
one.
[Music]
I think this is it.
I'm just trying to find the farthest
I'm just trying to find the farthest
like the best corner to spawn them in.
This is the closest agent.
Yeah, there it is. So, the distance of
Yeah, there it is. So, the distance of
from the other agent to the corner
Okay. like
distance of
There we
are. So, this is uh was a fair bit of
are. So, this is uh was a fair bit of
code, but if I have this correct
expected
expected
expression. This needs to be curly
expression. This needs to be curly
braces. So, if I have this correct, this
braces. So, if I have this correct, this
should look a lot better because they
should look a lot better because they
will no longer spawn on top of each
will no longer spawn on top of each
other. They should only
other. They should only
spawn near the uh the nearest what is
spawn near the uh the nearest what is
it? A corner that's relatively free.
Yeah. So, they're all spawning on top of
Yeah. So, they're all spawning on top of
each other. So, I probably did. It's
each other. So, I probably did. It's
probably the other way
probably the other way
around. Yeah. Yeah, we want max desk.
Boom. See if this does what we want and
Boom. See if this does what we want and
then we'll retrain.
Okay, first of all, that's not the right
coordinate. And second of all, they're
coordinate. And second of all, they're
still spawning on top of each
still spawning on top of each
other. Okay.
did not
did not
rebuild. That seems
rebuild. That seems
weird. Like that's not what I would have
weird. Like that's not what I would have
expected it to have
done. Oh yeah, they shouldn't be able to
done. Oh yeah, they shouldn't be able to
spawn there.
Interesting.
those distances make
