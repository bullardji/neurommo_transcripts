Hi. We're going to keep working on this
Hi. We're going to keep working on this
release today. I think we're actually

going to start running some of the

something. Switch this
something. Switch this
over and uh we will get
started. This stuff is cool.
literally working on this stuff right
now. All
now. All
right. So, what we're going to start
right. So, what we're going to start
with today,
with today,
uh, I've gotten some feedback here on
uh, I've gotten some feedback here on
how to get this,
how to get this,
uh, this environment working. I'll show
uh, this environment working. I'll show
off the environment first because it's a
off the environment first because it's a
really
cool
environment. Okay, so it's this it's

to converters. Converters change
to converters. Converters change
resources to other resources. So on and
resources to other resources. So on and
so forth

this running. We've now we have set
this running. We've now we have set
state-of-the-art on this environment
state-of-the-art on this environment
before uh with puffer
lab, but the environment's updated and
lab, but the environment's updated and
there are some bugs
This gym is
This gym is
uh My private training
facility is for training agents and
facility is for training agents and
training myself as well as my family.
[Applause]
They say I should install the whole
They say I should install the whole
freaking
meta. Okay.
This is pretty
annoying. I can technically I could try
annoying. I can technically I could try
it this way.
Yeah. So, I don't have a UV on this box
Yeah. So, I don't have a UV on this box
yet.
The thing is it runs
training but you can get these like
training but you can get these like
invalid action spam nonsense.
I mean, this seems like an end bug to
I mean, this seems like an end bug to
me. What's this invalid action? Can I
me. What's this invalid action? Can I
like find this in Um,
What the heck is this thing,
What the heck is this thing,
man? I shouldn't be using this network
man? I shouldn't be using this network
of
theirs. How the hell is
this? Like, I have my own policy.
Right.
Okay, we're definitely going to get this
Okay, we're definitely going to get this
thing to run
today. These are good. Like, this is a
today. These are good. Like, this is a
good speed. It's just there's some like
good speed. It's just there's some like
glitchy stuff happening with this end.
Oops.
All right. So, we'll see how this
goes. Best thing about the mornings here
goes. Best thing about the mornings here
is
is
uh we have orios and bluebirds right
uh we have orios and bluebirds right
outside. Very nice.
Let's figure out what uh what things are
Let's figure out what uh what things are
left to do
left to do
still for the release. And uh I think I
still for the release. And uh I think I
just need to get back in the mindset of
just need to get back in the mindset of
running all the uh the new experiments.
So, why don't we try to get the new
So, why don't we try to get the new
container on um one of the other
container on um one of the other
boxes and start seeing if we can get the
boxes and start seeing if we can get the
experiments running from there. I think
experiments running from there. I think
that would be
ideal. Upper box
zero.
Let's pop our puffer box here.
Yeah.
So, this should be 3.0.
So, this will pull this image
down and we will see if we can get the
down and we will see if we can get the
uh box running on the latest code. In
uh box running on the latest code. In
the
meantime, it's kind of just like a short

collect my uh my thoughts, get ready for

all the experiments we're going to do
all the experiments we're going to do
today.
Okay, so this does actually run for

sketchy. This doesn't get do too well,
sketchy. This doesn't get do too well,
but I think that that's the M, not our

Breakout. We definitely would like
Breakout. We definitely would like
breakout to be doing a little better.
Let's just see if very quickly if I can

figure out why
figure out why
uh why this is worse.
Not this one.
This
one. It's actually been a while since
one. It's actually been a while since
we've had the
we've had the
um the really good solve, it seems.
Oh, you know what it is? I know what it
is. So, this is like 22 21
is. So, this is like 22 21
seconds. See if we have any better. And
seconds. See if we have any better. And
I think it's the clip coefficient.
This is 24 seconds.
Okay, so now we're at like 20 second
Okay, so now we're at like 20 second
solve
here. This UI like this UI for being

like advertising itself as being very
like advertising itself as being very

like I mean this is pathetic.
Okay, so this is the run that had the 17

quick before breakfast was just get a
quick before breakfast was just get a
sense of what was different. I'm pretty
sense of what was different. I'm pretty
sure it's just going to be the clip
sure it's just going to be the clip

This one actually has substantially

no frame skip is set to four.
I think I made it
I think I made it

I suspect that the clip coefficient
I suspect that the clip coefficient
is going to be the the kicker
here. So the value function clip
here. So the value function clip

tapped to 0.1 and here it's at 0.01.

You Yes.
Now I see
Now I see
570. We do 570

Uh only annoying thing is that this
Uh only annoying thing is that this
machine is not a good one to run um

breakout on because you want to run the
breakout on because you want to run the
speed test on this the fastest
speed test on this the fastest
machine. We have other things to run

though, don't we?
We know mazes works
now. We kind of just want like ablations
now. We kind of just want like ablations
and
and

Something wrong with
snake. A lot of these m can be solved
snake. A lot of these m can be solved
very quickly.
I think we should kind of just set up

everything. And may maybe what I do is I
everything. And may maybe what I do is I
move this meta sweep onto
move this meta sweep onto
um I'm going to actually like just let
um I'm going to actually like just let
this see if this runs. And then I'm
this see if this runs. And then I'm
going to move this sweep onto here. I'm
going to move this sweep onto here. I'm
going to set up this other machine
going to set up this other machine
uh for our like high perf
uh for our like high perf
sweeps. It'll be good.
your system has God damn it.
That's a pain.
I don't know how secure boot gets on all
I don't know how secure boot gets on all

turn it off.
