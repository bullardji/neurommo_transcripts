an unprecedented result.

I don't think you've really seen
I don't think you've really seen
something like this since OpenAI's work
something like this since OpenAI's work
in 2019.
Like, okay, you got a curve. Big deal.

What's What's the curve?

Yeah, we are uh almost 400 billion steps

into training right now.

And we've got this very clean linear
And we've got this very clean linear
train curve.

Oh, and this is soda by a lot.
So, um, there are probably going to be
So, um, there are probably going to be
some power interruptions. So, it's
some power interruptions. So, it's
probably going to take me a while before
probably going to take me a while before
I get to run the full scale thing that I
I get to run the full scale thing that I
really want to do.
But, yeah, we're going to have the
But, yeah, we're going to have the
longest train run ever, which will be
longest train run ever, which will be
very cool.
very cool.
Welcome, Arga, as well.
So, um, here's where we're at.

pretty exciting stuff.
5:00 p.m. alarm. Good. So,
the uh the plan for today uh and the
the uh the plan for today uh and the
plan sort of over the next week, we
plan sort of over the next week, we
pretty much have release done.

to find an editor. Actually, if anybody

together a 30 secondond trailer.
together a 30 secondond trailer.
Obviously, we'll pay for that. Um,
Obviously, we'll pay for that. Um,
and then I have to clean up some posts.
and then I have to clean up some posts.
But other than that, like we have the
But other than that, like we have the
release ready to go. In fact, let me
release ready to go. In fact, let me
just show this. Let me show this off
just show this. Let me show this off
real quick, just so you can get an idea
real quick, just so you can get an idea
of the scale. Uh, you might have seen
of the scale. Uh, you might have seen
this if you were here late night on
this if you were here late night on
Saturday. Otherwise,
probably won't have seen this.
This is the new docs page and it's got
This is the new docs page and it's got
some nice stuff. It's got, you know, all
some nice stuff. It's got, you know, all
these nice new demos. It's got new
these nice new demos. It's got new
tutorials that I got to go through all
tutorials that I got to go through all
that stuff. Um, but the main thing,
that stuff. Um, but the main thing,
the ocean has expanded.
the ocean has expanded.
We now have 20 environments
We now have 20 environments
uh ready to go. And I believe we should
uh ready to go. And I believe we should
get at least two more on here. Two big
get at least two more on here. Two big
ones depending on uh who's finished what
ones depending on uh who's finished what
in the Discord. Potentially a couple
in the Discord. Potentially a couple
smaller ones as well. And these all work
smaller ones as well. And these all work
like a convert environment. You have a
like a convert environment. You have a
thousand agents in your browser.
got Tetris, which looks awesome. Thanks
got Tetris, which looks awesome. Thanks
to Hrien for that, or Adrien, I believe.
to Hrien for that, or Adrien, I believe.
H Adrien,
H Adrien,
your username is different from your
your username is different from your
real name. You're I'm going to say your
real name. You're I'm going to say your
username and forget. Yeah, we've got
username and forget. Yeah, we've got
this Tetris. It's very nice. Enduro,
this Tetris. It's very nice. Enduro,
which good. Freeway doesn't render quite
which good. Freeway doesn't render quite
correctly. Cars don't have wheels for
correctly. Cars don't have wheels for
some reason. But we do have uh
some reason. But we do have uh

Pac-Man which is pretty cool looking.

I don't know why the ghost chill for a
I don't know why the ghost chill for a
second at the start like that. But got
second at the start like that. But got
Pac-Man.
Pac-Man.
All sorts of nice environments. And then
All sorts of nice environments. And then
we even have demo environments like this
we even have demo environments like this
one here. This is a fully commented
one here. This is a fully commented
tutorial environment which really easy
tutorial environment which really easy
to follow this along and see how this is
to follow this along and see how this is
made. And this is kind of like the
made. And this is kind of like the
simplest environment that you can make
simplest environment that you can make
that still is really cool for multi-age.
Grab my chat.
I always just take this thing. It's kind
I always just take this thing. It's kind
of silly. I just go like this.
of silly. I just go like this.
Background opacity to one. And I stick
Background opacity to one. And I stick
this under my camera. I don't miss
this under my camera. I don't miss
messages or I miss fewer messages.
Let me change the extreme title and then
Let me change the extreme title and then
I think what we'll do is uh for the next
I think what we'll do is uh for the next
50 minutes or so just before breakfast
50 minutes or so just before breakfast
we will see uh if I can get a couple of
we will see uh if I can get a couple of
these other environments working with
these other environments working with
the web. Impulse force is very cool.
the web. Impulse force is very cool.
Impulse force is very very cool and we
Impulse force is very very cool and we
don't have that one on yet. So I
don't have that one on yet. So I
definitely want to do that.
I would change the uh
I don't know how we change the title
I don't know how we change the title
annoyingly enough, but
fine.
There's also Robocode which is to
There's also Robocode which is to
almost done with this. I put tactics
almost done with this. I put tactics
down here because we haven't had anybody
down here because we haven't had anybody
finish yet. But yeah, these are almost
finish yet. But yeah, these are almost
done.
done.
We'll see if we can get uh actually
We'll see if we can get uh actually
there's captain in the chat right there.
We'll see if uh he has any ideas on how
We'll see if uh he has any ideas on how
to get this on the web.
Yeah. So, Impulse Wars doesn't build
Yeah. So, Impulse Wars doesn't build
from here, which is annoying.
Well, we can definitely do this one.
And this thing is seg lovely.
This correctly listed under demo.
and
Hey, quick shot.
Just uh sending one quick message on the
Just uh sending one quick message on the
side here.
hair can be put on. Awesome. You're our
hair can be put on. Awesome. You're our
latest I merge right now. We put on
latest I merge right now. We put on

Look at this. We have all these M's.
Un uninfinish shame go into the work of
Un uninfinish shame go into the work of
work in progress of shame.
I put the uh the simple ones on as well,
I put the uh the simple ones on as well,
you know. I put like target and squared
you know. I put like target and squared
and all that.
and all that.
Some of these are like
Some of these are like
wrong. Oh, well, I I killed the the
wrong. Oh, well, I I killed the the
server, so
server, so
obviously
obviously
not going to work, but the Tetris one is
not going to work, but the Tetris one is
really nice. Like this is just an
really nice. Like this is just an
example of a really really well done
example of a really really well done
like new contributor
like new contributor
um environment because this is just so
um environment because this is just so
cool.
This is like really good work.
Oh, it does rotate pieces.
I am working on a trading sim.
I am working on a trading sim.
We uh we technically have one of those.
We uh we technically have one of those.
Oh yeah, we should we should figure out
Oh yeah, we should we should figure out
about that one as well, Spencer, to see
about that one as well, Spencer, to see
what they want to do
what they want to do
cuz we have uh we have stuff to reply to
cuz we have uh we have stuff to reply to
them on.
them on.
Render a moving plot each frame. Yep,
Render a moving plot each frame. Yep,
that's what we did.
I actually think that they should be
I actually think that they should be
fine with us releasing that given uh
fine with us releasing that given uh
recent stuff.
recent stuff.
Last frame tells the whole story though.
Yeah,
Yeah,
you want all M's on web. So I'm assuming
you want all M's on web. So I'm assuming
you want the C neural net code. So
you want the C neural net code. So
Captain, what we're going to do for
Captain, what we're going to do for
that, I don't want to make people spend
that, I don't want to make people spend
forever writing these obnoxious C
forever writing these obnoxious C
networks. Um,
networks. Um,
we can get something weaker on the like
we can get something weaker on the like
for just the website to start with. Uh,
for just the website to start with. Uh,
I'll probably just see like if I just
I'll probably just see like if I just
train like when's the last time you've
train like when's the last time you've
just tried to train like a linear plus
just tried to train like a linear plus
LSTM on this thing to see if it does
LSTM on this thing to see if it does
something. You know,
one exception is neural MMO. I'm going
one exception is neural MMO. I'm going
to put in some work to actually make
to put in some work to actually make
that work because we have a ludicrously
that work because we have a ludicrously
good result.
good result.
on neural MMO. This thing is super human
on neural MMO. This thing is super human
and um I don't think anybody has ever
and um I don't think anybody has ever
done a RL run of this scale on this
done a RL run of this scale on this
little hardware
little hardware
that almost 400 billion steps
and sitting dock two.
Where's our Terrap PR
Where's our Terrap PR
sensor have a terror PR?
I guess I can technically just build it.
I guess I can technically just build it.
What's wrong with their banner?
So, Captain, I would just train like a
So, Captain, I would just train like a
weaker one, right?
weaker one, right?
I would either set it to human control
I would either set it to human control
or I would just uh have a weaker one for
or I would just uh have a weaker one for
now. Like, so we actually have the end
now. Like, so we actually have the end
dynamics on the site so you can like
dynamics on the site so you can like
play it and stuff.
What do you mean you have a trade? We
What do you mean you have a trade? We
technically we did some work in that
technically we did some work in that
space. Uh that one wasn't released yet.
space. Uh that one wasn't released yet.
We should hopefully be able to release
We should hopefully be able to release
that. We'd have like some basic thing.
It's not for the It's not for the normal
It's not for the It's not for the normal
equities market though that I can say.
Yeah, we definitely need a better way of
Yeah, we definitely need a better way of
like getting these nets onto the onto
like getting these nets onto the onto
the site more quickly
cuz all like the custom nets are just
cuz all like the custom nets are just
very difficult to do.
financial mathematical models.
Well, I mean either way, whatever the
Well, I mean either way, whatever the
dynamics are. Yeah, it's like you kind
dynamics are. Yeah, it's like you kind
of just can make a cool graph to have
of just can make a cool graph to have
something to render, but uh yeah, it's
something to render, but uh yeah, it's
like the last frame tells you well I it
like the last frame tells you well I it
depends like if you run it for a very
depends like if you run it for a very
long time, right? Then like you can't
long time, right? Then like you can't
really compress you don't really want to
really compress you don't really want to
compress the whole graph necessarily.
compress the whole graph necessarily.
Like sometimes you have like a rolling
Like sometimes you have like a rolling
window.
I think there are rigorous financial
I think there are rigorous financial
mathematical models either. Like
if there were, you wouldn't be able to
if there were, you wouldn't be able to
ever make any money trading anything. it
ever make any money trading anything. it
would be fully optimized and these hedge
would be fully optimized and these hedge
funds wouldn't have jobs.
I guess there's still information
I guess there's still information
asymmetry, but I don't Yeah.
Yeah. Problem with a lot of the models
Yeah. Problem with a lot of the models
is they're not very good, right? And
is they're not very good, right? And
then also there's just massive ace. One,
then also there's just massive ace. One,
they're not very good, and two, there's
they're not very good, and two, there's
massive information asymmetry.
What do you need building without it?
What do you need building without it?
Would be nice, Captain, but the thing
Would be nice, Captain, but the thing
that I just want most is I want to know
that I just want most is I want to know
because like you don't have it hooked up
because like you don't have it hooked up
to the build script at all, but like
to the build script at all, but like
just how do I get a thing that I can put
just how do I get a thing that I can put
onto the web? like how do I run the EMCC
onto the web? like how do I run the EMCC
build and get it onto the web? Like the
build and get it onto the web? Like the
process, you can see me literally doing
process, you can see me literally doing
this right now, right? I do build ocean
this right now, right? I do build ocean
and name web. I copy it over. I add a
and name web. I copy it over. I add a
thumbnail. That's it. Reply to that on
thumbnail. That's it. Reply to that on
Discord. Oh, okay. I'm dumb. I literally
Discord. Oh, okay. I'm dumb. I literally
have it on my screen here. Let since you
have it on my screen here. Let since you
I have you right here. Make
I have you right here. Make
impulse. Where is it?
impulse. Where is it?
Upper li
make release demo web.
Ah, this is me.
and then we'll see what this is and if
and then we'll see what this is and if
it's suitable.
it's suitable.
Okay, so
that's not bad.
that's not bad.
Um,
Um,
which which of these files do I actually
which which of these files do I actually
need?
Like there's cmate crap in the release
Like there's cmate crap in the release
demo web, right?
demo web, right?
Is it just demostar?
You need the
You need the
like.
Yeah, but you need more like it'll load
Yeah, but you need more like it'll load
more files than just that.
more files than just that.
Hang on.
HTML data js. There's no was uh

there's no map file.
there's no map file.
Is anything else used like underscore
Is anything else used like underscore
depths
demo star? Okay, let's try that.
You usually do need the HTML
You usually do need the HTML
cuz it's packed into
like this is what I have for breakout on
like this is what I have for breakout on
the right. You say
okay.
okay.
And uh
And uh
what is it to run this thing like make
what is it to run this thing like make
release demo?

No.
Do I need new clang or whatever for

It's a bit irritating that it's not even
It's a bit irritating that it's not even
a clang version that's on 1224, but
should give you a place of relative

or somewhere here.
You will be free to PR a description

Actually, I'll let you fill this in.
Yeah, you can you can absolutely just in
Yeah, you can you can absolutely just in
fact what I'll do is you'll just be able
fact what I'll do is you'll just be able
to PR it to the uh the puffer.ai
to PR it to the uh the puffer.ai
branch.
I'll just let you do that.
I remove client 20 from the make file.
I hate heavy build systems for this
I hate heavy build systems for this
reason.
I I should already have all this stuff
I I should already have all this stuff
though,

I guess.
I guess.
I don't know why. Like my other build
I don't know why. Like my other build
should not work.
I don't know why it's using like
I don't know why it's using like
additional packages.
additional packages.
Rayb.
I don't know why the linker is Not
Okay.
What happened to the textures?
What happened to the textures?
Wait, what happened to the textures?
the lighting and stuff. Why is
the lighting and stuff. Why is
everything flat shaded?
Is this This is not how it's supposed to
Is this This is not how it's supposed to
look, right?
And we have it looking way better than
And we have it looking way better than
this. Yeah, this thing is literally
this. Yeah, this thing is literally
transparent.
Base puffer li assets will load.
Yeah, that's way freaking better.
loaded resources.
loaded resources.
I don't know. I'll have to see if they
I don't know. I'll have to see if they
show up on the website.
Is this 1920 x 1080 or something?
a white bong is massive here.
a white bong is massive here.
Oh, this broke everything. That's why
1920 1080.
These are all going to be like
Oh, okay. It kind of does a thing.
Oh, okay. It kind of does a thing.
Where's this garbage mcripting thing
Where's this garbage mcripting thing
for?
Okay.
I don't know why that M script and bar
I don't know why that M script and bar
pops up. Like there's something
pops up. Like there's something
different with the build system.
I want to use this darn end. I want to
I want to use this darn end. I want to
use this end. Like
use this end. Like
you should be able to do stuff with it.
you should be able to do stuff with it.
Yeah.
We have cracked out RL.
I double checked.
I think it would be. Yeah.
And also like
how's this even possible that it pops
how's this even possible that it pops
like this jank texture open?
like this jank texture open?
Oh, you need to have um so this thing
Oh, you need to have um so this thing
here like you can't you can't
here like you can't you can't
dynamically load this. You got to look
dynamically load this. You got to look
at the way that I did my mcripting
at the way that I did my mcripting
command. You preload all the assets in
command. You preload all the assets in
or like you preload specifically
or like you preload specifically
resources/impulse wars.
resources/impulse wars.
Like I took care of this basically
Like I took care of this basically
but it can't find any of the assets. So
but it can't find any of the assets. So
we have it on the website technically.
we have it on the website technically.
And what are these? two scripted bots or
And what are these? two scripted bots or
something or no one scripted bot and
something or no one scripted bot and
then you fine.
then you fine.
We have something on the website but
We have something on the website but
ideally fix
looks like this cool end that it is
okay
send me PR or
20 minutes ago.
What in the heck?
This is a bot, right?
No optics.
this like a random ass PR. car.
I do not understand.
This is what GP like or whatever the
This is what GP like or whatever the
model is came up with sustainable
model is came up with sustainable
self-sufficient future. Sure.
I have to run for breakfast in a few.
I will be back after breakfast for
I will be back after breakfast for
pretty much the whole rest of the day
as usual.
my dozers.
Hey Spencer, I got to run for breakfast
Hey Spencer, I got to run for breakfast
in a sec. But yeah, the goal is to get
in a sec. But yeah, the goal is to get
everything on the website. I want to
everything on the website. I want to
start like cutting like ideally even if
start like cutting like ideally even if
we don't have the agents in C, I want to
we don't have the agents in C, I want to
get clips of all the ends today so that
get clips of all the ends today so that
um I can like get a video editor to help
um I can like get a video editor to help
me cut them together.
and like figure out some cool way to
and like figure out some cool way to
present them, you know?
All right, I can answer something quick
All right, I can answer something quick
or I'll be uh or I'll be back in like 30
or I'll be uh or I'll be back in like 30
40 minutes.
40 minutes.
Actually, here. What? What's the GPU
Actually, here. What? What's the GPU
drive? Hang on.
drive? Hang on.
What's the question?
Hey. Hey.
Hey. Hey.
All right. So, the GPU drive thing. Um,
All right. So, the GPU drive thing. Um,
you know how we did the LSTM state reset
you know how we did the LSTM state reset
now? Yes.
now? Yes.
So when you eval like rendering the eval
So when you eval like rendering the eval
you have to reset the state with inside
you have to reset the state with inside
of that function but that's dependent on
of that function but that's dependent on
the length of that episode. So for GPU
the length of that episode. So for GPU
drive you have to basically hardcode it
drive you have to basically hardcode it
every 91 ticks on reample in order to
every 91 ticks on reample in order to
get the same performance in training but
get the same performance in training but
that would screw with other
that would screw with other
environments. So how would you like to
environments. So how would you like to
handle that in the pufferell file?
Uh, that's literally just for like
Uh, that's literally just for like
watching the policy back, right? That is
watching the policy back, right? That is
correct.
I mean, I can just have it in there and
I mean, I can just have it in there and
comment it for saying 4GPU drive, but
comment it for saying 4GPU drive, but
yeah, I think just don't put it there
yeah, I think just don't put it there
for now cuz like it's not going to make
for now cuz like it's not going to make
a huge difference. It's literally just
a huge difference. It's literally just
for watching it. It doesn't affect
for watching it. It doesn't affect
anything else. And the actual NYU guys
anything else. And the actual NYU guys
are going to have their own like
are going to have their own like
versions of stuff anyways,
versions of stuff anyways,
I think. So, do not include that in my
I think. So, do not include that in my
PR. I don't say just don't include that
PR. I don't say just don't include that
in the PR. Let's get that onto the
in the PR. Let's get that onto the
website. Let's chat with Eugene. Let's
website. Let's chat with Eugene. Let's
get this plus Terraform
get this plus Terraform
um into this in like some workable state
um into this in like some workable state
ideally. I'll put the school environ.
ideally. I'll put the school environ.
And like I I want to get the thing
And like I I want to get the thing
merged pretty much. I just want to get
merged pretty much. I just want to get
fine. I can probably get you pretty
fine. I can probably get you pretty
decent clips for Terra in the grid
decent clips for Terra in the grid
space. Um, I mean within a clip you'll
space. Um, I mean within a clip you'll
see it at least get to like I think so
see it at least get to like I think so
far like up to 80 90% from zero. Yeah.
far like up to 80 90% from zero. Yeah.
So for reference my plan is to just like
So for reference my plan is to just like
of all the non-trivial ends. I'm going
of all the non-trivial ends. I'm going
to just take clips at pretty much native
to just take clips at pretty much native
resolution, just screen recordings, not
resolution, just screen recordings, not
GIFs. Uh I'm going to find I might just
GIFs. Uh I'm going to find I might just
find somebody on Upwork. Ideally I find
find somebody on Upwork. Ideally I find
somebody that actually does stuff for
somebody that actually does stuff for
like YouTubers. Um because it's not just
like YouTubers. Um because it's not just
like oh cut it all together, right?
like oh cut it all together, right?
ideally like I find somebody that can
ideally like I find somebody that can
help me like come up with a cool way to
help me like come up with a cool way to
present it. Um,
present it. Um,
also we have like actual superhuman
also we have like actual superhuman
neural MMO policy now. So Oh, sick.
neural MMO policy now. So Oh, sick.
Yeah, we have uh I mean look at this
Yeah, we have uh I mean look at this
train cry. This is 400 billion steps.
train cry. This is 400 billion steps.
Jesus Christ. 400 billion. Yes, it's
Jesus Christ. 400 billion. Yes, it's
technically cued for a trillion if they
technically cued for a trillion if they
don't screw up my power
don't screw up my power
and it goes straight up.
and it goes straight up.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that doesn't look
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that doesn't look
like that's slowing down at all.
like that's slowing down at all.
You might even see nine at this rate.
You might even see nine at this rate.
Good.
Good.
So, yeah. Uh, and also, I think that
So, yeah. Uh, and also, I think that
this is like an undershot because when I
this is like an undershot because when I
actually watch the agents, they get to
actually watch the agents, they get to
12, but I think that some of them get
12, but I think that some of them get
spawn killed. Sure. I don't think I've
spawn killed. Sure. I don't think I've
ever gotten 1212.
ever gotten 1212.
Like, playing it. It's hard. It's hard.
Like, playing it. It's hard. It's hard.
What again does that represent? Is it
What again does that represent? Is it
like how many skills you level up to or
like how many skills you level up to or
something? It's level 12 in combat and
something? It's level 12 in combat and
forging. So that requires you to defeat
forging. So that requires you to defeat
uh 12 enemies of around your level and
uh 12 enemies of around your level and
then it requires you to uh harvest I
then it requires you to uh harvest I
believe it's eight tier one resources
believe it's eight tier one resources
and then like four tier two.
Damn.
Cool. All right. Yeah, that so that's my
Cool. All right. Yeah, that so that's my
question. I'll I'll make sure just to
question. I'll I'll make sure just to
not have that in the thing. I just
not have that in the thing. I just
wanted to make sure that it did
wanted to make sure that it did
represent I did figure out why my thing
represent I did figure out why my thing
was off by a little bit. I had an off by
was off by a little bit. I had an off by
one on my tick resets um on eval. So
one on my tick resets um on eval. So
that was why I wasn't getting 99 every
that was why I wasn't getting 99 every
time, but now it does. So we're totally
time, but now it does. So we're totally
good on uh on the rendering eval for GPU
good on uh on the rendering eval for GPU
drive 99.7%.
drive 99.7%.
Awesome. Hopefully we get this to Eugene
Awesome. Hopefully we get this to Eugene
and then Terraform will go up there and
and then Terraform will go up there and
GPU drive and then we'll have two that
GPU drive and then we'll have two that
are like not just games. It's like, hey,
are like not just games. It's like, hey,
we can kind of gify whatever.
Did you want to put GPU drive in Ocean
Did you want to put GPU drive in Ocean
or in uh work in progress?
or in uh work in progress?
I'm going to move both of these up to be
I'm going to move both of these up to be
fair. Like, as soon as you give me a
fair. Like, as soon as you give me a
policy,
policy,
I'm going to put them both. Yeah. I
I'm going to put them both. Yeah. I
mean, we can change them. It's There's
mean, we can change them. It's There's
not really a versioning thing. It's just
not really a versioning thing. It's just
stuff that like doesn't even train or
stuff that like doesn't even train or
whatever I put down here. So, like this
whatever I put down here. So, like this
will go up. Yeah. And I'm going to fix
will go up. Yeah. And I'm going to fix
uh whatever happened with tower climb
uh whatever happened with tower climb
train training right now. Yeah, but let
train training right now. Yeah, but let
me go ahead and make that VR
me go ahead and make that VR
on the site.
on the site.
Yep. Like these are all pretty good. And
Yep. Like these are all pretty good. And
I now this is more than 20 ms. Like
I now this is more than 20 ms. Like
oceans expanded.

Yeah. This one is just such a good
Yeah. This one is just such a good
example of like know what new

contributors can do in like a reasonable

amount of code that still looks awesome.
amount of code that still looks awesome.
Like look at this thing.
Like look at this thing.
Tetris. Yeah, look how freaking cool
Tetris. Yeah, look how freaking cool
this is for being like a relatively
this is for being like a relatively
simpler env.
Well, I don't think it's actually
Well, I don't think it's actually
superhuman. It's better than amateur
superhuman. It's better than amateur
player though. Mhm. Do you think if you
player though. Mhm. Do you think if you
just Is that just a matter of training
just Is that just a matter of training
at this point? Training and a little bit
at this point? Training and a little bit
of fiddling. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah. I mean, that's really fun to
Yeah. I mean, that's really fun to
watch, right?
watch, right?
So, I don't know if we're going to want
So, I don't know if we're going to want
to do something where we like, you know,
to do something where we like, you know,
categorize like the best ends or
categorize like the best ends or
something. Um,
something. Um,
but I think we definitely should have
but I think we definitely should have
like, you know, our preferred set of M's
like, you know, our preferred set of M's
that we use for experiments. And like I
that we use for experiments. And like I
think that this is going into that to
think that this is going into that to

All right, I gotta go. I will be uh back

I don't think you've really seen
I don't think you've really seen
something like this since OpenAI's work
something like this since OpenAI's work
in 2019.
Like, okay, you got a curve. Big deal.
Like, okay, you got a curve. Big deal.
What's What's the curve?

into training right now.
into training right now.
And we've got this very clean linear
And we've got this very clean linear
train curve.

Oh, and this is soda by a lot.
So, um, there are probably going to be
So, um, there are probably going to be
some power interruptions. So, it's
some power interruptions. So, it's
probably going to take me a while before
probably going to take me a while before
I get to run the full scale thing that I
I get to run the full scale thing that I
really want to do.
But, yeah, we're going to have the
But, yeah, we're going to have the
longest train run ever, which will be
longest train run ever, which will be
very cool.
very cool.
Welcome, Arga, as well.
So, um, here's where we're at.

pretty exciting stuff.
5:00 p.m. alarm. Good. So,
the uh the plan for today uh and the
the uh the plan for today uh and the
plan sort of over the next week, we
plan sort of over the next week, we
pretty much have release done.
pretty much have release done.
There are a couple more environments

need to have their models ported to C.
need to have their models ported to C.
So, we have cool demos. Um there are a
So, we have cool demos. Um there are a
few like administrative things. I want
few like administrative things. I want
to find an editor. Actually, if anybody
to find an editor. Actually, if anybody
knows a good spot to get like decent
knows a good spot to get like decent
editors, I'd like somebody to cut me
editors, I'd like somebody to cut me
together a 30 secondond trailer.
together a 30 secondond trailer.
Obviously, we'll pay for that. Um,
Obviously, we'll pay for that. Um,
and then I have to clean up some posts.
and then I have to clean up some posts.
But other than that, like we have the
But other than that, like we have the
release ready to go. In fact, let me
release ready to go. In fact, let me
just show this. Let me show this off
just show this. Let me show this off
real quick, just so you can get an idea
real quick, just so you can get an idea
of the scale. Uh, you might have seen
of the scale. Uh, you might have seen
this if you were here late night on
this if you were here late night on
Saturday. Otherwise,
probably won't have seen this.
This is the new docs page and it's got
This is the new docs page and it's got
some nice stuff. It's got, you know, all
some nice stuff. It's got, you know, all
these nice new demos. It's got new
these nice new demos. It's got new
tutorials that I got to go through all
tutorials that I got to go through all
that stuff. Um, but the main thing,
that stuff. Um, but the main thing,
the ocean has expanded.
the ocean has expanded.
We now have 20 environments
We now have 20 environments
uh ready to go. And I believe we should
uh ready to go. And I believe we should
get at least two more on here. Two big
get at least two more on here. Two big
ones depending on uh who's finished what
ones depending on uh who's finished what
in the Discord. Potentially a couple
in the Discord. Potentially a couple
smaller ones as well. And these all work
smaller ones as well. And these all work
like a convert environment. You have a
like a convert environment. You have a
thousand agents in your browser.
got Tetris, which looks awesome. Thanks
got Tetris, which looks awesome. Thanks
to Hrien for that, or Adrien, I believe.
to Hrien for that, or Adrien, I believe.
H Adrien,
H Adrien,
your username is different from your
your username is different from your
real name. You're I'm going to say your
real name. You're I'm going to say your
username and forget. Yeah, we've got
username and forget. Yeah, we've got
this Tetris. It's very nice. Enduro,
this Tetris. It's very nice. Enduro,
which good. Freeway doesn't render quite
which good. Freeway doesn't render quite
correctly. Cars don't have wheels for
correctly. Cars don't have wheels for
some reason. But we do have uh
some reason. But we do have uh
environment
environment
Pac-Man which is pretty cool looking.
Pac-Man which is pretty cool looking.
I don't know why the ghost chill for a
I don't know why the ghost chill for a
second at the start like that. But got
second at the start like that. But got
Pac-Man.
Pac-Man.
All sorts of nice environments. And then
All sorts of nice environments. And then
we even have demo environments like this
we even have demo environments like this
one here. This is a fully commented
one here. This is a fully commented
tutorial environment which really easy
tutorial environment which really easy
to follow this along and see how this is
to follow this along and see how this is
made. And this is kind of like the
made. And this is kind of like the
simplest environment that you can make
simplest environment that you can make
that still is really cool for multi-age.
Grab my chat.
I always just take this thing. It's kind
I always just take this thing. It's kind
of silly. I just go like this.
of silly. I just go like this.
Background opacity to one. And I stick
Background opacity to one. And I stick
this under my camera. I don't miss
this under my camera. I don't miss
messages or I miss fewer messages.
Let me change the extreme title and then
Let me change the extreme title and then
I think what we'll do is uh for the next
I think what we'll do is uh for the next
50 minutes or so just before breakfast
50 minutes or so just before breakfast
we will see uh if I can get a couple of
we will see uh if I can get a couple of
these other environments working with
these other environments working with
the web. Impulse force is very cool.
the web. Impulse force is very cool.
Impulse force is very very cool and we
Impulse force is very very cool and we
don't have that one on yet. So I
don't have that one on yet. So I
definitely want to do that.
I would change the uh
I don't know how we change the title
I don't know how we change the title
annoyingly enough, but
fine.
There's also Robocode which is to
There's also Robocode which is to
almost done with this. I put tactics
almost done with this. I put tactics
down here because we haven't had anybody
down here because we haven't had anybody
finish yet. But yeah, these are almost
finish yet. But yeah, these are almost
done.
done.
We'll see if we can get uh actually
We'll see if we can get uh actually
there's captain in the chat right there.
We'll see if uh he has any ideas on how
We'll see if uh he has any ideas on how
to get this on the web.
Yeah. So, Impulse Wars doesn't build
Yeah. So, Impulse Wars doesn't build
from here, which is annoying.
Well, we can definitely do this one.
And this thing is seg lovely.
This correctly listed under demo.
and
Hey, quick shot.
Just uh sending one quick message on the
Just uh sending one quick message on the
side here.
hair can be put on. Awesome. You're our
hair can be put on. Awesome. You're our
latest I merge right now. We put on
latest I merge right now. We put on
website.
website.
Look at this. We have all these M's.
Un uninfinish shame go into the work of
Un uninfinish shame go into the work of
work in progress of shame.
I put the uh the simple ones on as well,
I put the uh the simple ones on as well,
you know. I put like target and squared
you know. I put like target and squared
and all that.
and all that.
Some of these are like
Some of these are like
wrong. Oh, well, I I killed the the
wrong. Oh, well, I I killed the the
server, so
server, so
obviously
obviously
not going to work, but the Tetris one is
not going to work, but the Tetris one is
really nice. Like this is just an
really nice. Like this is just an
example of a really really well done
example of a really really well done
like new contributor
like new contributor
um environment because this is just so
um environment because this is just so
cool.
This is like really good work.
Oh, it does rotate pieces.
I am working on a trading sim.
I am working on a trading sim.
We uh we technically have one of those.
We uh we technically have one of those.
Oh yeah, we should we should figure out
Oh yeah, we should we should figure out
about that one as well, Spencer, to see
about that one as well, Spencer, to see
what they want to do
what they want to do
cuz we have uh we have stuff to reply to
cuz we have uh we have stuff to reply to
them on.
them on.
Render a moving plot each frame. Yep,
Render a moving plot each frame. Yep,
that's what we did.
I actually think that they should be
I actually think that they should be
fine with us releasing that given uh
fine with us releasing that given uh
recent stuff.
recent stuff.
Last frame tells the whole story though.
Yeah,
Yeah,
you want all M's on web. So I'm assuming
you want all M's on web. So I'm assuming
you want the C neural net code. So
you want the C neural net code. So
Captain, what we're going to do for
Captain, what we're going to do for
that, I don't want to make people spend
that, I don't want to make people spend
forever writing these obnoxious C
forever writing these obnoxious C
networks. Um,
networks. Um,
we can get something weaker on the like
we can get something weaker on the like
for just the website to start with. Uh,
for just the website to start with. Uh,
I'll probably just see like if I just
I'll probably just see like if I just
train like when's the last time you've
train like when's the last time you've
just tried to train like a linear plus
just tried to train like a linear plus
LSTM on this thing to see if it does
LSTM on this thing to see if it does
something. You know,
one exception is neural MMO. I'm going
one exception is neural MMO. I'm going
to put in some work to actually make
to put in some work to actually make
that work because we have a ludicrously
that work because we have a ludicrously
good result.
good result.
on neural MMO. This thing is super human
on neural MMO. This thing is super human
and um I don't think anybody has ever
and um I don't think anybody has ever
done a RL run of this scale on this
done a RL run of this scale on this
little hardware
little hardware
that almost 400 billion steps
and sitting dock two.
Where's our Terrap PR
Where's our Terrap PR
sensor have a terror PR?
I guess I can technically just build it.
I guess I can technically just build it.
What's wrong with their banner?
So, Captain, I would just train like a
So, Captain, I would just train like a
weaker one, right?
weaker one, right?
I would either set it to human control
I would either set it to human control
or I would just uh have a weaker one for
or I would just uh have a weaker one for
now. Like, so we actually have the end
now. Like, so we actually have the end
dynamics on the site so you can like
dynamics on the site so you can like
play it and stuff.
What do you mean you have a trade? We
What do you mean you have a trade? We
technically we did some work in that
technically we did some work in that
space. Uh that one wasn't released yet.
space. Uh that one wasn't released yet.
We should hopefully be able to release
We should hopefully be able to release
that. We'd have like some basic thing.
It's not for the It's not for the normal
It's not for the It's not for the normal
equities market though that I can say.
Yeah, we definitely need a better way of
Yeah, we definitely need a better way of
like getting these nets onto the onto
like getting these nets onto the onto
the site more quickly
cuz all like the custom nets are just
cuz all like the custom nets are just
very difficult to do.
financial mathematical models.
Well, I mean either way, whatever the
Well, I mean either way, whatever the
dynamics are. Yeah, it's like you kind
dynamics are. Yeah, it's like you kind
of just can make a cool graph to have
of just can make a cool graph to have
something to render, but uh yeah, it's
something to render, but uh yeah, it's
like the last frame tells you well I it
like the last frame tells you well I it
depends like if you run it for a very
depends like if you run it for a very
long time, right? Then like you can't
long time, right? Then like you can't
really compress you don't really want to
really compress you don't really want to
compress the whole graph necessarily.
compress the whole graph necessarily.
Like sometimes you have like a rolling
Like sometimes you have like a rolling
window.
I think there are rigorous financial
I think there are rigorous financial
mathematical models either. Like
if there were, you wouldn't be able to
if there were, you wouldn't be able to
ever make any money trading anything. it
ever make any money trading anything. it
would be fully optimized and these hedge
would be fully optimized and these hedge
funds wouldn't have jobs.
I guess there's still information
I guess there's still information
asymmetry, but I don't Yeah.
Yeah. Problem with a lot of the models
Yeah. Problem with a lot of the models
is they're not very good, right? And
is they're not very good, right? And
then also there's just massive ace. One,
then also there's just massive ace. One,
they're not very good, and two, there's
they're not very good, and two, there's
massive information asymmetry.
What do you need building without it?
What do you need building without it?
Would be nice, Captain, but the thing
Would be nice, Captain, but the thing
that I just want most is I want to know
that I just want most is I want to know
because like you don't have it hooked up
because like you don't have it hooked up
to the build script at all, but like
to the build script at all, but like
just how do I get a thing that I can put
just how do I get a thing that I can put
onto the web? like how do I run the EMCC
onto the web? like how do I run the EMCC
build and get it onto the web? Like the
build and get it onto the web? Like the
process, you can see me literally doing
process, you can see me literally doing
this right now, right? I do build ocean
this right now, right? I do build ocean
and name web. I copy it over. I add a
and name web. I copy it over. I add a
thumbnail. That's it. Reply to that on
thumbnail. That's it. Reply to that on
Discord. Oh, okay. I'm dumb. I literally
Discord. Oh, okay. I'm dumb. I literally
have it on my screen here. Let since you
have it on my screen here. Let since you
I have you right here. Make
I have you right here. Make
impulse. Where is it?
impulse. Where is it?
Upper li
make release demo web.
Ah, this is me.
and then we'll see what this is and if
and then we'll see what this is and if
it's suitable.
it's suitable.
Okay, so
that's not bad.
that's not bad.
Um,
Um,
which which of these files do I actually
which which of these files do I actually
need?
Like there's cmate crap in the release
Like there's cmate crap in the release
demo web, right?
demo web, right?
Is it just demostar?
You need the
You need the
like.
Yeah, but you need more like it'll load
Yeah, but you need more like it'll load
more files than just that.
more files than just that.
Hang on.
HTML data js. There's no was uh

depths
demo star? Okay, let's try that.
You usually do need the HTML

cuz it's packed into
like this is what I have for breakout on
like this is what I have for breakout on
the right. You say
okay.
okay.
And uh
And uh
what is it to run this thing like make

No.
Do I need new clang or whatever for

Wait, what happened to the textures?
the lighting and stuff. Why is
the lighting and stuff. Why is
everything flat shaded?
Is this This is not how it's supposed to
Is this This is not how it's supposed to
look, right?
And we have it looking way better than
And we have it looking way better than
this. Yeah, this thing is literally
this. Yeah, this thing is literally
transparent.
Base puffer li assets will load.
Yeah, that's way freaking better.
loaded resources.
loaded resources.
I don't know. I'll have to see if they
I don't know. I'll have to see if they
show up on the website.
Is this 1920 x 1080 or something?
a white bong is massive here.
a white bong is massive here.
Oh, this broke everything. That's why
1920 1080.
These are all going to be like
Oh, okay. It kind of does a thing.
Oh, okay. It kind of does a thing.
Where's this garbage mcripting thing
Where's this garbage mcripting thing
for?
Okay.
I don't know why that M script and bar
I don't know why that M script and bar
pops up. Like there's something
pops up. Like there's something
different with the build system.
I want to use this darn end. I want to
I want to use this darn end. I want to
use this end. Like
use this end. Like
you should be able to do stuff with it.
you should be able to do stuff with it.
Yeah.
We have cracked out RL.
I double checked.
I think it would be. Yeah.
And also like
how's this even possible that it pops
how's this even possible that it pops
like this jank texture open?
like this jank texture open?
Oh, you need to have um so this thing
Oh, you need to have um so this thing
here like you can't you can't
here like you can't you can't
dynamically load this. You got to look
dynamically load this. You got to look
at the way that I did my mcripting
at the way that I did my mcripting
command. You preload all the assets in
command. You preload all the assets in
or like you preload specifically
or like you preload specifically
resources/impulse wars.
resources/impulse wars.
Like I took care of this basically
Like I took care of this basically
but it can't find any of the assets. So
but it can't find any of the assets. So
we have it on the website technically.
we have it on the website technically.
And what are these? two scripted bots or
And what are these? two scripted bots or
something or no one scripted bot and
something or no one scripted bot and
then you fine.
then you fine.
We have something on the website but
We have something on the website but
ideally fix
looks like this cool end that it is
okay
send me PR or
20 minutes ago.
What in the heck?
This is a bot, right?
No optics.
this like a random ass PR. car.
I do not understand.
This is what GP like or whatever the
This is what GP like or whatever the
model is came up with sustainable
model is came up with sustainable
self-sufficient future. Sure.
I have to run for breakfast in a few.
I will be back after breakfast for
I will be back after breakfast for
pretty much the whole rest of the day
as usual.
my dozers.
Hey Spencer, I got to run for breakfast
Hey Spencer, I got to run for breakfast
in a sec. But yeah, the goal is to get
in a sec. But yeah, the goal is to get
everything on the website. I want to
everything on the website. I want to
start like cutting like ideally even if
start like cutting like ideally even if
we don't have the agents in C, I want to
we don't have the agents in C, I want to
get clips of all the ends today so that
get clips of all the ends today so that
um I can like get a video editor to help
um I can like get a video editor to help
me cut them together.
and like figure out some cool way to
and like figure out some cool way to
present them, you know?
All right, I can answer something quick
All right, I can answer something quick
or I'll be uh or I'll be back in like 30
or I'll be uh or I'll be back in like 30
40 minutes.
40 minutes.
Actually, here. What? What's the GPU
Actually, here. What? What's the GPU
drive? Hang on.
drive? Hang on.
What's the question?
Hey. Hey.
Hey. Hey.
All right. So, the GPU drive thing. Um,
All right. So, the GPU drive thing. Um,
you know how we did the LSTM state reset
you know how we did the LSTM state reset
now? Yes.
now? Yes.
So when you eval like rendering the eval
So when you eval like rendering the eval
you have to reset the state with inside
you have to reset the state with inside
of that function but that's dependent on
of that function but that's dependent on
the length of that episode. So for GPU
the length of that episode. So for GPU
drive you have to basically hardcode it
drive you have to basically hardcode it
every 91 ticks on reample in order to
every 91 ticks on reample in order to
get the same performance in training but
get the same performance in training but
that would screw with other
that would screw with other
environments. So how would you like to
environments. So how would you like to
handle that in the pufferell file?
Uh, that's literally just for like
Uh, that's literally just for like
watching the policy back, right? That is
watching the policy back, right? That is
correct.
I mean, I can just have it in there and
I mean, I can just have it in there and
comment it for saying 4GPU drive, but
comment it for saying 4GPU drive, but
yeah, I think just don't put it there
yeah, I think just don't put it there
for now cuz like it's not going to make
for now cuz like it's not going to make
a huge difference. It's literally just
a huge difference. It's literally just
for watching it. It doesn't affect
for watching it. It doesn't affect
anything else. And the actual NYU guys
anything else. And the actual NYU guys
are going to have their own like
are going to have their own like
versions of stuff anyways,
versions of stuff anyways,
I think. So, do not include that in my
I think. So, do not include that in my
PR. I don't say just don't include that
PR. I don't say just don't include that
in the PR. Let's get that onto the
in the PR. Let's get that onto the
website. Let's chat with Eugene. Let's
website. Let's chat with Eugene. Let's
get this plus Terraform
get this plus Terraform
um into this in like some workable state
um into this in like some workable state
ideally. I'll put the school environ.
ideally. I'll put the school environ.
And like I I want to get the thing
And like I I want to get the thing
merged pretty much. I just want to get
merged pretty much. I just want to get
fine. I can probably get you pretty
fine. I can probably get you pretty
decent clips for Terra in the grid
decent clips for Terra in the grid
space. Um, I mean within a clip you'll
space. Um, I mean within a clip you'll
see it at least get to like I think so
see it at least get to like I think so
far like up to 80 90% from zero. Yeah.
far like up to 80 90% from zero. Yeah.
So for reference my plan is to just like
So for reference my plan is to just like
of all the non-trivial ends. I'm going
of all the non-trivial ends. I'm going
to just take clips at pretty much native
to just take clips at pretty much native
resolution, just screen recordings, not
resolution, just screen recordings, not
GIFs. Uh I'm going to find I might just
GIFs. Uh I'm going to find I might just
find somebody on Upwork. Ideally I find
find somebody on Upwork. Ideally I find
somebody that actually does stuff for
somebody that actually does stuff for
like YouTubers. Um because it's not just
like YouTubers. Um because it's not just
like oh cut it all together, right?
like oh cut it all together, right?
ideally like I find somebody that can
ideally like I find somebody that can
help me like come up with a cool way to
help me like come up with a cool way to
present it. Um,
present it. Um,
also we have like actual superhuman
also we have like actual superhuman
neural MMO policy now. So Oh, sick.
neural MMO policy now. So Oh, sick.
Yeah, we have uh I mean look at this
Yeah, we have uh I mean look at this
train cry. This is 400 billion steps.
train cry. This is 400 billion steps.
Jesus Christ. 400 billion. Yes, it's
Jesus Christ. 400 billion. Yes, it's
technically cued for a trillion if they
technically cued for a trillion if they
don't screw up my power
don't screw up my power
and it goes straight up.
and it goes straight up.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that doesn't look
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that doesn't look
like that's slowing down at all.
like that's slowing down at all.
You might even see nine at this rate.
You might even see nine at this rate.
Good.
Good.
So, yeah. Uh, and also, I think that
So, yeah. Uh, and also, I think that
this is like an undershot because when I
this is like an undershot because when I
actually watch the agents, they get to
actually watch the agents, they get to
12, but I think that some of them get
12, but I think that some of them get
spawn killed. Sure. I don't think I've
spawn killed. Sure. I don't think I've
ever gotten 1212.
ever gotten 1212.
Like, playing it. It's hard. It's hard.
Like, playing it. It's hard. It's hard.
What again does that represent? Is it
What again does that represent? Is it
like how many skills you level up to or
like how many skills you level up to or
something? It's level 12 in combat and
something? It's level 12 in combat and
forging. So that requires you to defeat
forging. So that requires you to defeat
uh 12 enemies of around your level and
uh 12 enemies of around your level and
then it requires you to uh harvest I
then it requires you to uh harvest I
believe it's eight tier one resources
believe it's eight tier one resources
and then like four tier two.
Damn.
Cool. All right. Yeah, that so that's my
Cool. All right. Yeah, that so that's my
question. I'll I'll make sure just to
question. I'll I'll make sure just to
not have that in the thing. I just
not have that in the thing. I just
wanted to make sure that it did
wanted to make sure that it did
represent I did figure out why my thing
represent I did figure out why my thing
was off by a little bit. I had an off by
was off by a little bit. I had an off by
one on my tick resets um on eval. So
one on my tick resets um on eval. So
that was why I wasn't getting 99 every
that was why I wasn't getting 99 every
time, but now it does. So we're totally
time, but now it does. So we're totally
good on uh on the rendering eval for GPU
good on uh on the rendering eval for GPU
drive 99.7%.
drive 99.7%.
Awesome. Hopefully we get this to Eugene
Awesome. Hopefully we get this to Eugene
and then Terraform will go up there and
and then Terraform will go up there and
GPU drive and then we'll have two that
GPU drive and then we'll have two that
are like not just games. It's like, hey,
are like not just games. It's like, hey,
we can kind of gify whatever.
Did you want to put GPU drive in Ocean
Did you want to put GPU drive in Ocean
or in uh work in progress?
or in uh work in progress?
I'm going to move both of these up to be
I'm going to move both of these up to be
fair. Like, as soon as you give me a
fair. Like, as soon as you give me a
policy,
policy,
I'm going to put them both. Yeah. I
I'm going to put them both. Yeah. I
mean, we can change them. It's There's
mean, we can change them. It's There's
not really a versioning thing. It's just
not really a versioning thing. It's just
stuff that like doesn't even train or
stuff that like doesn't even train or
whatever I put down here. So, like this
whatever I put down here. So, like this
will go up. Yeah. And I'm going to fix
will go up. Yeah. And I'm going to fix
uh whatever happened with tower climb
uh whatever happened with tower climb
train training right now. Yeah, but let
train training right now. Yeah, but let
me go ahead and make that VR

Yeah. I mean, that's really fun to
Yeah. I mean, that's really fun to
watch, right?

So, I don't know if we're going to want
So, I don't know if we're going to want
to do something where we like, you know,
to do something where we like, you know,
categorize like the best ends or
