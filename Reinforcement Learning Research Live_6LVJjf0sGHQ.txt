done a few things. I've only done short

you.
Yeah, everyone always asks me for like

started and this and that. So I just I
put everything in those two articles.

give you a little bit of extra data

might catch a couple of things.
I can't say it's bad.
This is fine.
You also probably have to do this in the

we could add um we could just add a

have to remember that you need this flag

It's buried. Look at my media post.
Yeah. Where is this?
You do like what is it? colon media.
I don't know how to do even do this.
Nah.

Uh this is fine. I've actually I've been

putting this stuff in this C file
putting this stuff in this C file
lately. I think it's a little cleaner
lately. I think it's a little cleaner
because you don't actually need this in
because you don't actually need this in
theh
we have compute observations.
This is fine.
This is fine.
Is there any normalization here?
I would probably put all of these under
I would probably put all of these under
the same active check and not have all
the same active check and not have all
these turn areas. But I guess there's
these turn areas. But I guess there's
also the inbounds.
also the inbounds.
Not terrible.
Yeah. Yeah. The main thing here I'm
Yeah. Yeah. The main thing here I'm
seeing is um it looks like you don't
seeing is um it looks like you don't
have normalization.
have normalization.
There is where
they understand what this is. So

What do you think of CC code?
What do you think of CC code?
How bad the types are.
How bad the types are.
You're over complicating things if you
You're over complicating things if you
think the type declarations are bad. We
think the type declarations are bad. We
use like floats, ints, pointer, strrus.
use like floats, ints, pointer, strrus.
That's it. We're not using fancy types.
The point of C is to keep things simple.

If you try to do fancy things, it will
If you try to do fancy things, it will
not let you. And that is the appeal to
not let you. And that is the appeal to
us
us
is we just do everything in the
is we just do everything in the
simplest, dumbest way possible. And
simplest, dumbest way possible. And
everything is very, very easy when you
everything is very, very easy when you
do it that way.
I really don't enjoy Rust. My opinions
I really don't enjoy Rust. My opinions
on that are less so to do with the type
on that are less so to do with the type
system though and more so to do with the
system though and more so to do with the
uh the freaking borrow checker.
Wait, what? I'm trying to understand
Wait, what? I'm trying to understand
your observation structure here, Linky.
your observation structure here, Linky.
Just make sure it's a small subset of

As long as you don't try to do something
As long as you don't try to do something

when you try to do like more abstracted

do fancy stuff that you see in more
do fancy stuff that you see in more
modern languages, you're not going to
modern languages, you're not going to
have a good time. The zen of C is that
have a good time. The zen of C is that
you didn't need those things anyways.
And code is fast by default.
You're going over.
I kind of don't understand your
I kind of don't understand your
observations, Linky. I don't know where
observations, Linky. I don't know where
if you're uh still here,
if you're uh still here,
cuz like it looks like you're just going
cuz like it looks like you're just going
over cars
and like arbitrarily picking some of
and like arbitrarily picking some of
them to put in the observations.
And then you have
And then you have
ak invert.
ak invert.
And then what you have here,
And then what you have here,
you make this thing
you you
Okay, this is like a binary mask. OBS of
Okay, this is like a binary mask. OBS of
where stuff is,
where stuff is,
but then you also have this stuff.
Lots of improvements, great consistency.
Uh to what specifically
Invert.
Invert.
Kinetic vertical.
Oh,
kinetic vertical.
All right.
Grid radius.
I see. So you kind of just do a local
I see. So you kind of just do a local
thing.
thing.
Know why you do a local thing for guess
Know why you do a local thing for guess
it's smaller.
it's smaller.
But like if you're going to do a local
But like if you're going to do a local
thing, you didn't have to compute all of
thing, you didn't have to compute all of
them, right? You could have just done it
them, right? You could have just done it
in line
serving the car value such as 5x5 box.
Why wouldn't you just like go through
Why wouldn't you just like go through
the cars, see if they're in that 5x5,
the cars, see if they're in that 5x5,
and then put them there? They are. And
and then put them there? They are. And
it would just be like one. You'd have
it would just be like one. You'd have
like one piece of code about this length
like one piece of code about this length
instead of like four of them.
instead of like four of them.
Three or four of them. Yeah. Four of
Three or four of them. Yeah. Four of
them.
I also don't see normalization on this
I also don't see normalization on this
this portion here. I don't know if I
this portion here. I don't know if I
missed it, but I don't see uh
missed it, but I don't see uh
normalization on these first several ops
normalization on these first several ops
can make a difference.
This is fine.
I mean there's still some small things
I mean there's still some small things
here like this should be temp
yeah this is better than before for sure
good
good
the app.
I think this is this could be one me
I think this is this could be one me
set. I'm pretty sure
Good.
No log here.
This probably sets logs. Yeah.
First five are not normed.
First five are not normed.
Probably be dropped,
which is important.
Yeah, like
I would probably have just done
if I wanted to do a windowed thing like
if I wanted to do a windowed thing like
this, I probably would have just done
this, I probably would have just done
like um two tiles, I would have done
like um two tiles, I would have done
like a 5x5 by however many channels
like a 5x5 by however many channels
thing. And if I wanted to do flat, I
thing. And if I wanted to do flat, I
would just take, you know, the cars
would just take, you know, the cars
around you, sort them, sort them
around you, sort them, sort them
probably polar coordinates or something,
probably polar coordinates or something,
or maybe by radius, I don't know, and
or maybe by radius, I don't know, and
then just stick them in flat. Either of
then just stick them in flat. Either of
those would work for an environment like
those would work for an environment like
this.
See the moving of the cars here.
Okay, I'm still seeing like basic style
Okay, I'm still seeing like basic style
things for sure that uh you could clean
things for sure that uh you could clean
up here. Like if here, watch. Look at
up here. Like if here, watch. Look at
this. Look how silly this is.
You'll see as soon as I scroll. Okay,
You'll see as soon as I scroll. Okay,
look at this.
look at this.
You see,
you see how like cluttered this is by
you see how like cluttered this is by
comparison as if you just made a temp
comparison as if you just made a temp
variable for that.
It's like half of the code is this one
It's like half of the code is this one
access, right?
access, right?
which makes it quite a bit harder to
which makes it quite a bit harder to
read.
So there are definitely still some style
So there are definitely still some style
things. So you are definitely doing like
things. So you are definitely doing like
fewer of these than before. That is good
fewer of these than before. That is good
progress.
I harp on things like this because it
I harp on things like this because it
really does make a big difference. And
really does make a big difference. And
not just in like the final thing that
not just in like the final thing that
I'm looking at here, but it'll make a
I'm looking at here, but it'll make a
big difference to you while you're
big difference to you while you're
building things.
I wouldn't be able to keep track of what
I wouldn't be able to keep track of what
the hell was going on if I were doing
the hell was going on if I were doing
this.
Yeah. Okay. So, this is just like
Not that complicated car moving logic.
Not that complicated car moving logic.
Then you kind of like went and ignore
Then you kind of like went and ignore
these types of things for this one. I
these types of things for this one. I
mean at least
like
this makes sense.
You just trying to spawn it on like the
You just trying to spawn it on like the
first valid tile. That work
kind of always going to spawn it at the
kind of always going to spawn it at the
top. Now
if you see the actual environment to see
if you see the actual environment to see
what that causes
Yeah. How would I do this, right? I
Yeah. How would I do this, right? I
would probably just pick 10 random
would probably just pick 10 random
positions and try like 10 times to spawn
positions and try like 10 times to spawn
a car or whatever.
a car or whatever.
I dropped a video in general. Let me see
I dropped a video in general. Let me see
what we're looking at here.
what we're looking at here.
Will help.
Okay. So, it's like lily pads.
There are roadblocks as well where I
There are roadblocks as well where I
guess there are no cars in the road
guess there are no cars in the road
blocks.
I would have structured things a little
I would have structured things a little
differently. I think
differently. I think
700's definitely long for this.
Okay. And now here we have the rendering
Okay. And now here we have the rendering
which is versus stuff which is fine.
I mean, I think you're going to have
I mean, I think you're going to have
like
like
you'd have something that would look a
you'd have something that would look a
fair bit cooler if you would do um
fair bit cooler if you would do um
like actual graphics for it and it
like actual graphics for it and it
wouldn't be any more code, but that's
wouldn't be any more code, but that's
fine.
Rendering code's reasonable.
have your switch if you
Yeah. So you're doing this thing here
Yeah. So you're doing this thing here
where like
you're like going through all the cars.
I guess you have to draw every tile
I guess you have to draw every tile
anyways.
anyways.
I'd probably just have a list or like
I'd probably just have a list or like
I'd have an array of cars everywhere,
I'd have an array of cars everywhere,
right? It just has the cars flat with
right? It just has the cars flat with
their positions.
their positions.
It probably be easier.
Maybe not. It might be harder to move
Maybe not. It might be harder to move
them then.
A little non-trivial, I guess.
A little non-trivial, I guess.
Me think how I would actually
No, maybe I would do it the way you're
No, maybe I would do it the way you're
doing it here actually.
doing it here actually.
Yeah, I think that this is fine. Like
Yeah, I think that this is fine. Like
this is how I This is probably how I
this is how I This is probably how I
would do it as a first pass as well.
would do it as a first pass as well.
Fine.
I do I don't know why you have the
I do I don't know why you have the
Windows stuff though in uh
Windows stuff though in uh
in the environment instead of in a
in the environment instead of in a
renderer. It's because you don't have
renderer. It's because you don't have
like a client strct. I think you end up
like a client strct. I think you end up
having to do everything in there which
having to do everything in there which
maybe isn't bad. I guess because it
maybe isn't bad. I guess because it
doesn't technically open up a window.
doesn't technically open up a window.
I'd have to see if n curses does any
I'd have to see if n curses does any
weird initialization.
You create a lily pad path. That's
You create a lily pad path. That's
funny.
Sometimes I'm literally just like when
Sometimes I'm literally just like when
I'm looking at stuff like this, I just
I'm looking at stuff like this, I just
like kind of think about what the
like kind of think about what the
function is supposed to do and then I
function is supposed to do and then I
kind of just guess in my head how much
kind of just guess in my head how much
code I think it would take and see if
code I think it would take and see if
that's like the amount of code that you
You don't need to put it into a client.h
You don't need to put it into a client.h
link key. You don't need a separate
link key. You don't need a separate
file, just a separate strct.
file, just a separate strct.
You know what? You see what I mean? I
You know what? You see what I mean? I
don't necessarily know if you need it.
don't necessarily know if you need it.
So with ray, you definitely need it
So with ray, you definitely need it
because you don't want ray objects in
because you don't want ray objects in
your or ray strrus in your environment.
your or ray strrus in your environment.
You don't like
You don't like
It's strct level, not
It's strct level, not
I like I don't know how big that window
I like I don't know how big that window
thing is and what it's going to do under
thing is and what it's going to do under
the hood with end curses cuz like when
the hood with end curses cuz like when
you go to train, right, remember you're
you go to train, right, remember you're
going to make 8,000 of those.
going to make 8,000 of those.
Anything in the struct is going to get

Hang on, Spencer.
Half
funny little recursion.
Yeah,
definitely extras
definitely extras
too.
This is a mess set.
I'm set.
also kind of.
Okay,
Okay,
so
so
this is definitely an improvement.
this is definitely an improvement.
Um,
Um,
the end looks good. like the actual
the end looks good. like the actual
what's going on looks reasonable to me.
what's going on looks reasonable to me.
Uh I think that you can make like as for

improving
improving
I think that you the patterns I'm seeing
I think that you the patterns I'm seeing
are
are
uh not using temp variables where they
uh not using temp variables where they
make your life easier.
make your life easier.
Uh I'm seeing
Uh I'm seeing
like kind of redundant stuff. Some of
like kind of redundant stuff. Some of
it's more forgivable because it's like,
it's more forgivable because it's like,
oh yeah, okay, you can kind of just mems
oh yeah, okay, you can kind of just mems
set stuff. Um,
set stuff. Um,
I there are definitely like blocks of
I there are definitely like blocks of
logic as well where like you could have
logic as well where like you could have
compressed things and done stuff in like
compressed things and done stuff in like
one pass over the data instead of three.
Really, the way that you see that part
Really, the way that you see that part
of it is experience. The other part is
of it is experience. The other part is
just like keeping everything clean so
just like keeping everything clean so
it's easier to see the patterns.
it's easier to see the patterns.
the less code and the simpler stuff you
the less code and the simpler stuff you
have, the easier it is to kind of see
have, the easier it is to kind of see
those patterns.
I think that you're probably writing
I think that you're probably writing
around 30 to 50% too much code at the
around 30 to 50% too much code at the
moment for a problem, which is a heck of
moment for a problem, which is a heck of
an improvement from before.
I'm trying to think what actionable
I'm trying to think what actionable
stuff I can give you.
stuff I can give you.
window takes control of your term and
window takes control of your term and
get subdivided
get subdivided
only gets actually. Okay. So, if that
only gets actually. Okay. So, if that
strruct if that window strct isn't huge,
strruct if that window strct isn't huge,
it's fine
it's fine
because you're going to make
because you're going to make
Oh, yeah. It's not huge. Okay, that's
Oh, yeah. It's not huge. Okay, that's
fine because it's just a pointer. That's
fine because it's just a pointer. That's
fine.
fine.
Yeah, I wouldn't bother with that.
Yeah, I wouldn't bother with that.
That's fine.
I mean the thing is like at least now
I mean the thing is like at least now
you're you're actually like executing on
you're you're actually like executing on
reasonably sized projects. It's just the
reasonably sized projects. It's just the
simplicity which will come with more
simplicity which will come with more
experience.
experience.
I would suggest to you as an exercise
I would suggest to you as an exercise
before I merge this. You don't don't go
before I merge this. You don't don't go
redo everything or don't even go redo
redo everything or don't even go redo

see that just out of the box, the RL

serving the car value such as 5x5 box.
Why wouldn't you just like go through
Why wouldn't you just like go through
the cars, see if they're in that 5x5,
the cars, see if they're in that 5x5,
and then put them there? They are. And
and then put them there? They are. And
it would just be like one. You'd have

like one piece of code about this length
like one piece of code about this length

Three or four of them. Yeah. Four of

I also don't see normalization on this

missed it, but I don't see uh
normalization on these first several ops
normalization on these first several ops
can make a difference.
This is fine.
I mean there's still some small things
I mean there's still some small things
here like this should be temp
yeah this is better than before for sure
good
good

I think this is this could be one me
I think this is this could be one me
set. I'm pretty sure
Good.
No log here.
This probably sets logs. Yeah.
First five are not normed.

which is important.
Yeah, like
I would probably have just done
if I wanted to do a windowed thing like
if I wanted to do a windowed thing like
this, I probably would have just done
this, I probably would have just done
like um two tiles, I would have done
like um two tiles, I would have done
like a 5x5 by however many channels
like a 5x5 by however many channels
thing. And if I wanted to do flat, I
thing. And if I wanted to do flat, I
would just take, you know, the cars
would just take, you know, the cars
around you, sort them, sort them
around you, sort them, sort them
probably polar coordinates or something,
probably polar coordinates or something,
or maybe by radius, I don't know, and
or maybe by radius, I don't know, and
then just stick them in flat. Either of
then just stick them in flat. Either of
those would work for an environment like
those would work for an environment like
this.
See the moving of the cars here.
Okay, I'm still seeing like basic style
Okay, I'm still seeing like basic style
things for sure that uh you could clean
things for sure that uh you could clean
up here. Like if here, watch. Look at
up here. Like if here, watch. Look at
this. Look how silly this is.
You'll see as soon as I scroll. Okay,
You'll see as soon as I scroll. Okay,
look at this.
look at this.
You see,
you see how like cluttered this is by
you see how like cluttered this is by
comparison as if you just made a temp
comparison as if you just made a temp
variable for that.
It's like half of the code is this one
It's like half of the code is this one
access, right?
access, right?
which makes it quite a bit harder to
which makes it quite a bit harder to
read.
So there are definitely still some style
So there are definitely still some style
things. So you are definitely doing like
things. So you are definitely doing like
fewer of these than before. That is good
fewer of these than before. That is good
progress.
I harp on things like this because it
I harp on things like this because it
really does make a big difference. And
really does make a big difference. And
not just in like the final thing that
not just in like the final thing that
I'm looking at here, but it'll make a

big difference to you while you're
building things.
I wouldn't be able to keep track of what
I wouldn't be able to keep track of what
the hell was going on if I were doing
the hell was going on if I were doing
this.
Yeah. Okay. So, this is just like
Not that complicated car moving logic.
Not that complicated car moving logic.
Then you kind of like went and ignore
Then you kind of like went and ignore
these types of things for this one. I
these types of things for this one. I
mean at least
like
this makes sense.
You just trying to spawn it on like the
You just trying to spawn it on like the
first valid tile. That work
kind of always going to spawn it at the
kind of always going to spawn it at the
top. Now
if you see the actual environment to see
if you see the actual environment to see
what that causes
Yeah. How would I do this, right? I
Yeah. How would I do this, right? I
would probably just pick 10 random
would probably just pick 10 random
positions and try like 10 times to spawn
positions and try like 10 times to spawn
a car or whatever.
a car or whatever.
I dropped a video in general. Let me see
I dropped a video in general. Let me see
what we're looking at here.
what we're looking at here.
Will help.
Okay. So, it's like lily pads.
There are roadblocks as well where I
There are roadblocks as well where I
guess there are no cars in the road

blocks.
I would have structured things a little

differently. I think
differently. I think
700's definitely long for this.
Okay. And now here we have the rendering

which is versus stuff which is fine.
I mean, I think you're going to have
I mean, I think you're going to have

like
you'd have something that would look a
you'd have something that would look a
fair bit cooler if you would do um
fair bit cooler if you would do um
like actual graphics for it and it
like actual graphics for it and it
wouldn't be any more code, but that's
wouldn't be any more code, but that's
fine.
Rendering code's reasonable.
have your switch if you
Yeah. So you're doing this thing here
Yeah. So you're doing this thing here
where like
you're like going through all the cars.
I guess you have to draw every tile
I guess you have to draw every tile
anyways.
anyways.
I'd probably just have a list or like
I'd probably just have a list or like
I'd have an array of cars everywhere,
I'd have an array of cars everywhere,
right? It just has the cars flat with

their positions.
their positions.
It probably be easier.
Maybe not. It might be harder to move
Maybe not. It might be harder to move
them then.
A little non-trivial, I guess.
A little non-trivial, I guess.
Me think how I would actually
No, maybe I would do it the way you're
No, maybe I would do it the way you're
doing it here actually.
doing it here actually.
Yeah, I think that this is fine. Like
Yeah, I think that this is fine. Like
this is how I This is probably how I
this is how I This is probably how I

Fine.
I do I don't know why you have the
I do I don't know why you have the
Windows stuff though in uh
Windows stuff though in uh
in the environment instead of in a
in the environment instead of in a
renderer. It's because you don't have
renderer. It's because you don't have
like a client strct. I think you end up
like a client strct. I think you end up
having to do everything in there which
having to do everything in there which
maybe isn't bad. I guess because it
maybe isn't bad. I guess because it
doesn't technically open up a window.

I'd have to see if n curses does any

Sometimes I'm literally just like when

like kind of think about what the

kind of just guess in my head how much

that's like the amount of code that you

I there are definitely like blocks of

one pass over the data instead of three.
Really, the way that you see that part

of it is experience. The other part is

just like keeping everything clean so
just like keeping everything clean so
it's easier to see the patterns.
it's easier to see the patterns.
the less code and the simpler stuff you

I think that you're probably writing

I'm trying to think what actionable

you're you're actually like executing on

simplicity which will come with more

I would suggest to you as an exercise
I would suggest to you as an exercise
before I merge this. You don't don't go
before I merge this. You don't don't go
redo everything or don't even go redo
redo everything or don't even go redo
any substantial portion. Just like go

where hey, I have this variable 40

Cuz like I just know that you don't need

That will come with time though.
That will come with time though.
I think fixing a couple nuts and bolts
I think fixing a couple nuts and bolts
will give you a little bit more clarity
will give you a little bit more clarity
over what you're doing. And then other
over what you're doing. And then other
than that, it's just keep putting in

reps. And uh I mean there's only like
the plus side, right, is if there's only
the plus side, right, is if there's only
50% of this to shave off, I would say.
50% of this to shave off, I would say.
No, not 50%. 50% too much. So it's 33%
No, not 50%. 50% too much. So it's 33%
to shave off. I think you could probably

do this in about 450 500 lines while

what's happened with Puffer 3.
and the PF is going up on the uh the

Going to see if this can make the flag.
And then if this can make the flag, then

we'll figure out basically what went

to web assembly.
Like realistically, if I spend a huge

Now look, if you like steal the way that

we do stuff and then you start porting

We will see how that goes in practice.
Okay, There.
